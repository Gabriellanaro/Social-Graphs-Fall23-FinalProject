Another experiment with Taste Sensation Seasonings.
Cajun Chicken Noodle Stir Fry! That sounds weird, but I bet it will be fine.  I marinaded the chicken slices in lime juice for an hour, then added the Cajun Seasoning and a tablespoon of olive oil to a Lock and Lock box, closed the lid and shook for ten seconds.  This leaves the chicken perfectly coated.  It could be stir fried on a wok but I'm going to air fry it in the basket so it can be cooked with no extra oil.

I've used the remains of the Morrisons pre-packed stir-fry ingredients from yesterday's Chilli and lime chicken stir fry.
===Ingredients===

| 1 large chicken breast, cut into thin strips
| 2 tablespoons of lime juice
| 1 heaped tablespoon of Taste Sensation Cajun Seasoning
| 3 tablespoon olive oil
| Half a packet of bean sprouts [180 g]
| Half a packet of fresh egg noodles [205 g]
| Half a packet of Sweet & Crunchy stir fry [300 g]
===Mise en place===

* If you get the chance, marinade the chicken pieces in lime juice for an hour before you add the Cajun Seasoning

===Method===


| Pop the sliced chicken in a lock and lock box together with the Taste Sensation Cajun Seasoning and one of the tablespoons of olive oil.  Shake like crazy to mix.  Leave to marinade for a while longer if you can.
| This is quicker and easier if you have two woks, if not cook the chicken first and keep warm while you cook the vegetables
| Stir fry the chicken in a tablespoon of olive oil, turning regularly until the chicken is properly cooked - about 5 minutes or longer if it's thickly sliced
| Stir-fry the vegetables in a tablespoon of olive oil until they are wilted
| Toss in the beans shoots and noodles and stir-fry until cooked - about 4 minutes
| Mix in the cooked chicken and serve immediately
===Variations===
You can also cook the chicken in an air-fryer basket for about 5 minutes, instead of pan-frying
