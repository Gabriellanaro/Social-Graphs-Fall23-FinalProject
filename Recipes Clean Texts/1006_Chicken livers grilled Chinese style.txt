===Description===

A Chinese slant on grilled chicken livers.  This recipe is fantastic.  Moist and tasty chicken livers, easy to make and about the cheapest meat you could buy.

| 2 tablespoons (45 ml) light soy sauce

| 1 tablespoon (15 ml) minced ginger root
| 1 tablespoon (15 ml) dry sherry
| 2 cloves of garlic, peeled and crushed
| Good pinch of fine sea salt
===Method===


| Parboil the chicken livers for 3 minutes then drain well in sieve
| Add the remaining ingredients to a Lock & Lock-style box, mix well, add the chicken livers, replace the lid and shake like crazy!

| Drain the marinade and discard
| Spray or lightly oil a hot griddle pan and spread the chicken livers evenly over the hot surface.
| Griddle for 8 minutes, turning once
