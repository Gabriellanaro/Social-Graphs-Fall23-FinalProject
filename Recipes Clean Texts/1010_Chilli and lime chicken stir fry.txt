[[Image:Morrisons stir fry selection.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Half quantities of Morrisons stir fry selection (for two people)]]
Another experiment with taste sensation seasonings.  I used their excellent Chilli and Lime Seasoning recently in Chili and lime spiced butternut squash.  This time I thought I would try a stir-fry.

I've used Morrisons pre-packed stir-fry ingredients as they are the easiest way to get a decent variety of vegetables.  Half quantities of these packs are perfect for a two-person stir fry.  Just check the quality of the bean sprouts as they can be rather close to sell-by (or bin-by) date.
===Ingredients===

| 1 large chicken breast, cut into thin strips
| 1 heaped tablespoon of Taste Sensation Chilli and Lime Seasoning
| 3 tablespoons of olive oil
| Half a packet of bean sprouts [180 g]
| Half a packet of fresh egg noodles [205 g]
| Half a packet of Sweet & Crunchy stir fry [300 g]
| Splash of dark soy sauce - optional
| Splash of dry sherry - optional
===Mise en place===

* If you get the chance, leave the chicken pieces, dusted with the Taste Sensation Chilli and Lime Seasoning in the refrigerator for a few hours beforehand to enhance the flavour.

===Method===


| Pop the sliced chicken in a lock and lock box together with the Taste Sensation Chilli and Lime Seasoning and one of the tablespoons of olive oil.  Shake like crazy to mix.  Leave to marinade for a while if you get the chance.
| This is quicker and easier if you have two woks, if not cook the chicken first and keep warm while you cook the vegetables
| Stir fry the chicken in a tablespoon of olive oil, turning regularly until the chicken is properly cooked - about 5 minutes or longer if it's thickly sliced
| Stir-fry the vegetables in a tablespoon of olive oil until they are wilted
| Toss in the beans shoots and noodles and stir-fry until cooked - about 4 minutes
| If using, add a splash of sherry and soy sauce and mix well
| Mix in the cooked chicken and serve immediately
===Variations===
You can also cook the chicken in an air-fryer basket for about 5 minutes, instead of pan-frying
