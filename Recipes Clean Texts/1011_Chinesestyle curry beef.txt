===Description===


A spicy beef stew cooked in the pressure cooker so the beef breaks down into that lovely tender stringy pieces.

Spicy but not hot.
===Ingredients===

| 450 g stewing steak from Russell's Butchers of Upwell
| Good pinch of freshly ground black pepper
| 5 cloves of garlic, crushed
| 1 leek sliced into rings
| 4 tablespoons tomato sauce (Heinz etc)
| 2 tablespoons dark soy sauce
| 2 bs light soy sauce
| 3 tablespoons lime juice
| 2 tablespoons soft brown sugar
| 1 heaped teaspoon curry powder
| 1 teaspoon smoked paprika powder
| 4 whole star anise
| 2 tablespoon olive oil
===Mise en place===

* Add everything to a large Lock and Lock box, shake really well to mix and leave to marinade for a few hours, or overnight

===Method===


| Place the marinaded mixture in a bowl that will fit in your pressure cooker
| ''I have modified a cheap saucepan so that it fits inside a pressure cooker and is easier to remove than a Pyrex bowl''
| Cook in the pressure cooker at high pressure for 1 hour 30 minutes - ''see Chef's notes''.
| Depressurise normally, this will take about 15 minutes
| Serve!
