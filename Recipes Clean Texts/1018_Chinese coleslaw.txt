The Judge 

An oriental slant (sic) on a common salad dish.  Ideal for barbecues.
===Ingredients===
| Half a Chinese cabbage, shredded
| 2 carrots, peeled and grated
| 6 spring onions, thinly sliced on the diagonal
| A handful of coriander leaves
| 20g (3/4 oz) jaggery, shaved with a mandoline
| 2 tablespoons nam pla
| 3 tablespoons lime juice
| Freshly ground black pepper
| 3 tablespoons peanut oil
===Method===


| Toss the cabbage, carrot, spring onions and coriander together in a bowl
| Dissolve the jaggery in the lime juice and nam pla
| Add a twist of black pepper and add the oil whilst whisking vigorously
| Pour over the salad and toss well
==Footnote==

Well, the best laid plans of mice and men... I couldn't get Chinese cabbage so used a sweetheart cabbage.  I forgot and used all of the coriander in the marinate for the ginger-spiced lamb and after dropping (and of course, breaking) a full bottle of olive oil, time was tight, so everything went in the food processor.  Anyway, it still tasted great!
