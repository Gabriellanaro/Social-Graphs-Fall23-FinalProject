Chinese food often looks dull.  Not this one; bright and colourful.

===Description===

[[Image:MyWay.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Traditional Chinese steamer and my way]]
A very healthy and simple way to cook boneless chicken pieces that retains moisture with no added fat.  An ideal way to prepare chicken for a spicy salad.

Why not try jointing your first chicken for this recipe?

===Ingredients===
| 1 chicken breast
| 2 slices ginger root, chopped into matchsticks
| 1 clove garlic, sliced
| 1 large spring onion (scallion) finely chopped
| 1 teaspoon soy sauce
| 1 teaspoon chili flakes or 1 fresh red chili, julienned
| 1 squeeze lime or lemon juice
===Method===

| Place the chicken breast on a piece of foil large enough to wrap the chicken in a parcel
| Lay the chicken on a bed made from half of the ingredients then scatter the remaining over the top
| Wrap the chicken in the foil
| I use a vegetable steamer on an upturned bowl in a large pan, but a normal Chinese steamer works ok
| Bring a saucepan of water to the boil and place the chicken on your steamer so it's over but not immersed in water
| Cover and simmer for 20 to 30 minutes or until the chicken properly cooked. Core of chicken breast 74\u00b0 C (165\u00b0 F)   It will depend on the size of the chicken.
| Don't allow it to boil dry!
| Discard all but the chicken once cooked
===Serving suggestions===

Serve hot or cold.  Chicken with cold tossed beansprouts is good with chicken cooked this way.

===Variations===

Add more chili, ginger or garlic if you are crazy for the stuff.
