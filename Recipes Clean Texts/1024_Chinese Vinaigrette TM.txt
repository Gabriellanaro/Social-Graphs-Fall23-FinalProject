The recipe quantities are massive - quarter of the quantity would be fine.

===Description===

This is a translation of a recipe in '''Salsas y Ali\u00f1os con Thermomix (Susaeta Ediciones)'''.

===Ingredients===TM
| 200g rice vinegar
| 225g sugar
| 2 tablespoons sesame oil
| 2 teaspoons salt
| 1 teaspoon lemon juice
| 2 tablespoons water
===Method===


| Put the water, vinegar and sugar in the TM and beat '''2 minutes / Speed 5'''.
| Next, add the oil, salt and lemon and beat '''5 minutes / Speed 6''', then increase to '''Speed 7 for 10 seconds''' and stop the machine.
| So that the sauce can acquire a suitable consistency, leave to rest for a few hours.
===Servings===
Servings: 4 - Makes 350 ml
===Variations===
This is a very simple recipe, which allows you to enjoy the sauce which accompanies salads in Chinese restaurants.  The original recipe contains aji-no-moto in place of the lemon.  This quirky ingredient can be found in some oriental food shops.  In this case you can substitute the lemon for 3 tsps aji-no-moto.
===Chef's notes===
The sugar quantity seems rather large (as it does in many Spanish recipe books), so you may wish to start off with a smaller amount and then add more if desired.
