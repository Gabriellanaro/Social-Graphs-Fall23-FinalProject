===Description===

A healthy, Abel & Cole twist to the classic Chinese crispy duck pancakes.

===Ingredients===

| 2 duck legs
| 1 red chilli, chopped
| 10 g fresh ginger, chopped or grated
| A splash of soy sauce
| 20 g drizzle of honey
| 100 g spring onions
| 1 300 g  cucumber
| 8 large lettuce leaves
| 50 ml hoisin sauce
| Fresh coriander leaves (optional)
| Fresh lime (optional)
===Mise en place===

* Heat the oven to 160\u00b0 C (325\u00b0 F - gas 3), [fan oven 140\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]

===Method===


| Pop duck in a roasting dish. Add chilli, ginger, soy sauce and honey. Massage into duck.
| Roast for 45 mins. Then, crank the oven up to 190\u00b0 C (375\u00b0 F - gas 5), [fan oven 170\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour] to help crisp the skin; cook for 15 mins, till duck is crisp, golden and cooked through - test by piercing a fat part of the leg - if the juices run clear, it's done.
| Rest for 15 mins.
| Slice onions and cucumbers into wispy wands. Wash your lettuce leaves.
| Shred the cooled duck. Spoon some sauce over it. Fold through.
===Serving suggestions===
To eat: pile a mound of saucy duck onto a leaf. Top with cucumber and spring onion. Add extra sauce, coriander and lime, if you like.
===Variations===
Vegan option: Swap the duck for brown rice noodles. Toss warm, cooked noodles with a glug of hoisin sauce. Pile into leaves with garnishes, as above.
