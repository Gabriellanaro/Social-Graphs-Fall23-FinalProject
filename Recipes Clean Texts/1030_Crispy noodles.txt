A different way to cook Chinese egg noodles

===Ingredients===
| 410 g fresh egg noodles
| Sesame oil
'''OR'''
* 2 'sheets' of dried egg noodles

===Method===


| Cook the noodles as directed.  
| Fresh noodles: soak in boiling water for a few minutes. 
| Dried noodles: soak or boil for 3 or 4 minutes or until soft.
| Drain very well.
| So they can be served immediately, cook the noodles in separate pans if you are able.
| Heat a tablespoon of sesame oil in each frying pan and then tip half of the noodles into each pan.
| Shimmy the pan so they spread over the whole surface.
| Fry for about 3 minutes a site without disturbing them.
| Flip them over, adding a little more sesame oil if needed.
| Cook for 2 minutes on this side.
