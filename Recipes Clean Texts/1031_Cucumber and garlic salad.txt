[[Image:Pretty cucumbers.jpg|300px|thumb|right|Pretty-up the cucumbers (although in this recipe they should be sliced into moons)]]
Looking for cucumber salad ideas, I found the basis for this recipe in a very old Ken Hom cookery book; The Taste of China.

I've changed the oil to olive oil as I prefer it to peanut oil and also added toasted sesame seeds because I think they work so well with cucumbers, both visually and in a culinary sense.

When we were growing cucumbers in our conservatory we were always hunting out good recipes to use them up.  This is an ideal example of a way to use up your glut of cucumbers.

===Ingredients===

| 450 g [1 lb] cucumbers
| 2 teaspoons fine salt
| 2 teaspoons of castor sugar
| 1 tablespoon white wine vinegar
| 1.5 tablespoons of olive oil
| 4 cloves of garlic, peeled and crushed

===Method===


| Peel the cucumbers
| Cut them in half lengthways and using a tablespoon or an ice-cream scoop, remove the seeds
| Chop the cucumbers into 'moons', about 1cm [1/2 \" wide]
| Toast the sesame seeds for a few minutes in a hot, dry pan so they turn golden
| Put the cucumbers into a bowl and sprinkle with the salt then sit them in a colander for 10 minutes to allow them to drain
| Rinse them under cold running water
| Pat them dry with a paper towel or dry in a salad spinner
| Add the dried cucumbers to a bowl and sprinkle with the sugar and white wine vinegar
| Heat the olive oil in a wok and saute the crushed garlic, the moment it start to color, remove from the heat, allow to cool then add it to the cucumbers and mix well
===Serving suggestions===
Serve dressed with the toasted sesame seeds
===Variations===
Partially peeling the cucumbers as in the picture make them really quite attractive.
