The Judge 

Hoisin sauce is the distinctively flavoured brown sauce that is usually served with crispy duck pancakes.   It is available from all supermarkets and turns this simple dish into a very special meal.

===Ingredients===
| 450 g skinless, boneless chicken breasts
| 1 tablespoon dry sherry
| 2 tablespoons cornflour
| 1 egg white, lightly beaten
| 3 tablespoons groundnut oil
| 4 Cloves of garlic, peeled and thinly sliced
| 2.5cm (1\") of fresh ginger, peeled and julienned 
| 4 spring onions, sliced on the diagonal
|* That's 4 if they are nice fat spring onions, 8 or more if they are miserable examples from the supermarket!
| 175 g (6 oz) button mushrooms, sliced
| 4 tablespoons walnut pieces
| 4 tablespoons hoisin sauce
===Method===


| Whisk the egg-white, cornflour and sherry in a bowl
| Chop the chicken into thin, bite-sized pieces and add to the bowl, mix well and leave to marinade for 30 minutes or more.
| Heat half of the oil in a wok until almost smoking and add the chicken, jiggle the wok a little to prevent the chicken sticking, but turn as little as possible. Stir-fry for 4 or 5 minutes or until the chicken is almost cooked. 
|Add the remaining oil, throw in the ginger, garlic and half of the spring onions and stir-fry until the garlic starts to colour a little.
|Add the mushrooms and walnuts and stir fry until the mushrooms wilt a little.
|Pour the hoisin sauce over the chicken and heat until the hoisin sauce starts to bubble.
| Serve immediately and sprinkle with the remaining spring onions.
===Serving suggestions===
Nice with plain boiled rice or noodles.
===Variations===
* Add a selection of your favourite vegetables at stage 5.
* Add a few chopped Indian green chillies at stage 5 for a bit more bite.
*Use shiitake mushrooms if you can get them.
