They were very nice, not very Chinese though, do you think?

===Description===


A nice simple recipe that I been using for years, originally copied from a long forgotten Chinese recipe book. The Chinese influence, I guess, is that it's made from chicken stock rather than milk?  It's really just a prawn omelette!

It's the sort of recipe that's great as a base; just mess about and add other things you fancy to make a very special meal.
===Ingredients===

| 50g of small peeled prawns (or shrimps)
| 4 eggs, lightly beaten
| 75g plain flour
| sea salt
| Freshly ground black pepper, mixed with freshly ground Szechuan peppercorns
| 120 ml chicken stock - stock made from chicken Oxo is fine - allow to cool properly before mixing with the eggs!
| 2 spring onions, chopped
| 2 tablespoons olive oil

===Method===


| Add everything apart from the oil, prawns and spring onions to a mixing bowl
| Mix everything together to make a nice batter
| Stir in the prawns and spring onions
| Heat a little of the olive oil in a large frying pan
| Spoon in a quarter of the mix and tip the pan top coat evenly
| Cook until lightly browned, then turn and brown the other side
| Repeat with the other three pancakes

===Serving suggestions===
Serve with a salad and fresh tomatoes
===Variations===
This recipe is lovely with crayfish but I couldn't get any today.
===Chef's notes===
The 0riginal recipe calls for on 50g of prawns; we're pigs so will be using a full 200g pack of peeled prawns!
