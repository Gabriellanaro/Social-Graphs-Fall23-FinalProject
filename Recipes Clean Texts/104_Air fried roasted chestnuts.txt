===Description===

Did you wonder \"Can you roast chestnuts in an air fryer?\"

If you did the answer is yes! Works rather well and takes one hour.
===Ingredients===

| 400 g sweet chestnuts
| A good shake of salt

===Method===


| Using a sharp pointed knife, stab a slit in each chestnut, this stops them exploding and makes then a little easier to peel, once cooked.
| Add a shake of salt
| Pop then in the air fryer for one hour
| Allow to cook for 10 minutes, then peel and eat!
