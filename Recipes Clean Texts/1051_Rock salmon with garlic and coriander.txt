I really don't remember making this, but the camera never lies.  It looks superb - who knows?  I shall have to make this again.

===Description===

This dish is better, the longer it is marinated.

The salt helps to remove a little of the moisture so firming the flesh.

===Ingredients===
| 700 g (1.5 lb) rock salmon fillet, cut into 8 pieces or 4 large fillets
| Juice of ½ lime, lemon or orange
| 1 teaspoon zest of same
| 2 teaspoons ginger root, peeled and grated, reserve any juice
| 2 teaspoons nam pla
| 1 garlic clove, peeled and crushed
| 1 onion, peeled and sliced finely
| 1 to 2 teaspoons red chilli flakes
| 3 tablespoons olive oil
| 3 tablespoons freshly chopped coriander
| sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
| Lime or orange wedges to serve


===Mise en place===
* Preheat the oven to 180\u00b0 C (350\u00b0 F - gas 4) after step 4

===Method===


| Generously season the rock salmon with sea salt and black pepper
| Drizzle the citrus juice, zest and nam pla over the fish
| Roll the fish in the marinade to ensure it's well coated
| Refrigerate for an hour or two
| In a pan, gently fry the onion and garlic in the olive oil until soft, about 4 minutes
| Stir in the chilli flakes, ginger root and any juice
| Oil a small ovenproof dish and lay the fish in it together with the juices
| Cover with the coriander leaves and then ladle the onion mixture over the top
| Bake uncovered for 20 minutes
===Serving suggestions===

Serve hot, with lime or orange wedges and plain boiled rice.

===Variations===

Use basa, ling, halibut or conger eel as an alternate fish for this dish

Having a fridge clean, I added a chopped sweet pepper and a few celery sticks at the same time as the onions and garlic.
