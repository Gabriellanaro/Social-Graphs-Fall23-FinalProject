===Description===

This recipe was an experiment  to try and replicate the typical Chinese crispy duck takeaway meal ands I have to say it was an astounding success!
The result was tender and succulent with lovely flavours and not at all greasy.  The duck meat was almost like liver!

===Ingredients===

| 2 duck legs, skin on
| 2 whole star anise
| Pinch of hickory smoke powder
| 1 teaspoon soft brown sugar
| 10 szechuan peppercorns
| 10 black peppercorns
| ¼ teaspoon harissa seasoning
| ½ teaspoon Taste Sensation Lime Juice Powder
| 1 large thumb-sized piece of ginger, sliced thinly
| 1 tablespoon dark soy sauce

===Method===


| Grind all of the spices apart from the star anise to a fine powder in a mortar and pestle
| Coat the duck legs with the spice powder
| Pop the duck legs, sliced ginger and dark soy sauce in to a Lock and Lock box, cover and shake well
| Refrigerate the spicy legs for 10 hours or until you're ready to cook them
| After 10 hours, drain any excess liquid and seal the duck legs in a vacuum seal bag
| Cook in a sous-vide bath for 10 hours at 82\u00b0C (179.6\u00b0F)
| After cooking, discard the star anise, pat the legs dry and crisp the skin with a Map Gas blow torch
| The Map Gas torches do not taint the food, which some blowtorches do
| Serve!
