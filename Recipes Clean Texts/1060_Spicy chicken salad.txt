===Description===



A hot and spicy chicken salad with loads of flavours. This would last 2 people a couple of days if you keep the dressing and spices in a airtight containers and only cut the vegetables up when ready to use them.

===Ingredients===

| 4 chicken breast fillets cut into thin slices
| 1 tablespoon of olive oil to fry the chicken pieces
'''chicken marinade'''
===Ingredients===NB
| 4 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed
| 1 tablespoon sesame oil
| 1 tablespoon light soy sauce
| 1 tablespoon dark soy sauce
'''salad items'''
===Ingredients===NB
| Â½ cup of cashew nuts, dry-roasted and crushed
| 4 shallots, peeled and very thinly sliced
| 10 whole baby sweetcorn cobs, thinly sliced
| 1 stalk of lemongrass very thinly sliced
| 3 spring onions, sliced
| 1 teaspoon fresh galangal, peeled and chopped
| 2 fresh red chillies, deseeded and sliced
| 1 Iceberg lettuce, sliced
'''dressing'''
===Ingredients===NB
| 220 ml (1/2 cup) coconut milk
| 2 tablespoons nam pla
| 2 tablespoons lime juice
| 2 tablespoons jaggery or brown sugar
'''garnish'''
===Ingredients===NB
| 8 Mint leaves, chopped
| 1 red chilli, deseeded and chopped into slices
| Small bunch of coriander leaves, chopped
===Mise en place===

* Mix the marinade ingredients in a lock and lock box, shake well and marinate for 2 to 3 hours in a cool place

===Method===

| allow to cool.
| Add the salad items to a large bowl, together with the chicken pieces, pour over the dressing and sprinkle with the garnish
===Chef's notes===
Roasting and crushing cashews in a pestle and mortar: I found it easier to first smash the cashews in a mortar, by covering them with a cloth and bashing them with the pestle through the cloth.  This stops the bits going everywhere. Then roast the crushed remains, every part gets nicely toasted this way.
