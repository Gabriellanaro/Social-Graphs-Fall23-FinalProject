===Description===


A sweet and sour dish that is far removed from the standard Chinese take-away.

This dish is better, the longer it is marinated.

The salt helps to remove a little of the moisture so firming the flesh.

===Ingredients===
| 2 basa fillets
| Juice and zest of one lime
| 2 teaspoons ginger root, peeled and grated, reserve any juice
| 2 teaspoons nam pla
| 2 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed
| 1 small onion, peeled and finely chopped
| 2 sticks of celery, chopped into small 'moons'
| 1 large sweet pepper, any colour, deseeded and chopped
| 2 Indian green chillies, finely chopped
| 2 tablespoons of Rice vinegar, normal vinegar will be fine
| 1 tablespoon of sugar
| 3 tablespoons olive oil
| 3 tablespoons freshly chopped coriander or parsley
| sea salt and freshly ground black pepper


===Mise en place===
* Preheat the oven to 180\u00b0 C (350\u00b0 F - gas 4) after step 4
===Method===


| Generously season the basa with sea salt and black pepper
| Drizzle the citrus juice, zest and nam pla over the fish
| Place in a lidded Lock and Lock-style box, shake well and refrigerate for one to four hours
| In a pan, gently fry the onion and garlic, celery and red peppers in the olive oil until soft, about 10 minutes
| Stir in the sugar, vinegar, chopped chilli, ginger root and any juice from the marinade
| Oil a small ovenproof dish and layer the fish and vegetables in it together with all of the juices
| Bake covered for 30 minutes
===Serving suggestions===
Serve hot on a bed of plain boiled rice sprinkled with the chopped herbs.

===Variations===
Use basa, ling, halibut or conger eel as an alternate fish for this dish

This recipe was the result of a fridge-clean, any combination of your favourite vegetables would be perfect in this dish.
