===Description===


Cocoa beans directly from Cuban farms are the secret ingredient to the deeply chocolate orange filling for desserts.

===Ingredients===

| 50 ml double cream
| 113 g (4 ounces) Willie's Cacao Cuban Orange Chocolate
| 50 ml cream cheese
| 55g butter
| 1 tablespoon Orange Liquor (Cointreau is nice)

===Method===


| Heat the heavy cream over medium heat.  When quite hot, throw in broken chocolate pieces.  Stir with spoon, off the heat, and watch the chocolate dissolve into the cream.
| In separate pan, melt butter and cream cheese, stirring constantly.  Add liquor.  Once it is pourable, pour into chocolate sauce mixture.
| Mix well or leave a few black and white streaks for extra drama....
===Serving suggestions===
As a filler for desserts, served on its own with fruit, the perfect fondue holiday dip.
===Recipe source===


===Variations===
Substitute other tropical liquors for an easy accent to the recipe.
===Chef's notes===
Authentic  Cuban  chocolate, carrying deep tones of flavour, is what makes this filling a winner.  Cuban Cuisine now sell Willie's Cacao Cuban Orange Chocolate online.
