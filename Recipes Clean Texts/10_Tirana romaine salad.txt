A very simple, but refreshing salad from Albania's capital city.

===Ingredients===
| 1 romaine lettuce, chopped
| 1 bunch of spring onions, chopped
| 2 hard-boiled eggs, sliced
| Seasoning
| Olive oil
| Lemon juice
===Method===


| Mix the lettuce, spring onions and egg in a bowl.
| Season to taste.
| Just before serving, make a dressing of olive oil and lemon juice to taste (a minimum of 3 parts oil to 1 part lemon juice, but you could increase the oil quantity to 5 parts oil).
===Serving suggestions===
Serve as an accompaniment, but would be fine on its own with some good bread.
