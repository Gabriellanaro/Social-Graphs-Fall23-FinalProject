It is also a celebrated dish in Costa Rica where it is more commonly known as 'salcocho.' This thick hearty stew features the island's favourite root vegetables. Sancocho is made ​​with potato, plantains, squash, cassava or yams with some added meat.  Most popular are beef and pork. Legumes are also added as beans, lentils or pigeon peas ... It is full of healthy ingredients, low in fat and a funky twist on beef stew.
