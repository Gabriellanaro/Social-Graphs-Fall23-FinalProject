===Description===

[[Image:Yorkshire pudding batter mixture.jpg|300px|thumb|right|]]
This is the recipe that Annie always uses for making Yorkshire puddings.  It is copied from Delia Smith's 'Complete Cookery Course' but with a few changes that over the years have proven to make a perfect batter with a good rise.

In Delia's recipe she says it will serve 4 but I disagree, it serves 2 pigs with a few leftover popovers.

The three main tricks to getting a well risen Yorkshire every time are:

* Whisk by hand, just enough to combine well. Do not use an electric whisk or go mad when hand beating

* Allow the batter to reach room temperature by resting for 30 minutes first.  Do not rest in the fridge.  This will reduce the rise substantially.

* Oil the popover or Yorkshire pudding tray and heat over a naked flame just before pouring the batter mixture into the tray, then put in the over immediately.
===Ingredients===

| 75 g (3 oz) plain flour
| 1 large egg
| '''A total of 130 ml (5 fl oz) of liquid, comprised of:'''
| 75 ml (3 fl oz) milk ''any type of milk is fine''
| 55 ml (2 fl oz) water
| Pinch of sea salt
| Pinch of freshly ground black pepper
| 2 tablespoons vegetable oil to grease baking tray
===Mise en place===

* Preheat the oven to 220\u00b0 C (425\u00b0 F - gas 7), [fan oven 200\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]

===Method===


| Sift the flour into a large bowl
| Add the milk, water and salt and pepper to a jug
| Make a depression in the middle of the flour and break the egg into it
| Using a hand whisk, beat the egg into the flour
| Once the egg and flour starts to combine, gradually mix in all of the liquids
| Rest at '''room temperature''' for 30 minutes - do not refrigerate
| Using a silicone brush, distribute 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil into the Yorkshire pudding tray or popover tray
| Carefully heat the tray on the hob top until the oil starts to sizzle
| Pour the batter mixture evenly into the tray
| Pop into the top of the oven and bake for 25 to 30 minutes
