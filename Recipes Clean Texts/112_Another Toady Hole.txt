Some batter pudding can be rather weak - this is lovely and rich

===Description===

We've tried many different recipes for toad in the hole and this is our current favourite - especially as we now have our own free-range hens again.
===Ingredients===

| 285 ml milk
| 115 g plain flour
| 3 eggs
| Pinch of salt
| Pinch of freshly grounds black pepper
| 6 pork sausages from Russell's Butchers of Upwell, Norfolk
| A handful of sage leaves, torn
===Mise en place===

* Preheat you oven to maximum

===Method===


| Whisk the batter ingredients in a bowl until smooth and leave at room temperature
| Wait for the oven to have been on for about 5 minutes so it's started to warm, but not yet at maximum heat
| Spread 2 tablespoons of olive oil over a baking tray with a silicone spatula
| Slice each sausage length-wise so any fat released is spread over the baking tray
| Arrange the sausages, cut-side-down and sprinkle with torn sage leaves
| Pop the tray in the oven and leave to bake for about 5 minutes or until the sausages start to brown
| Pour the batter over the sausages
| Put the tray back in the oven on a middle shelf and bake for 20 minutes, don't open the oven during this period
