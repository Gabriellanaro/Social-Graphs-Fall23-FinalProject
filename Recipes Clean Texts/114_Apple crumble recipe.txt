===Description===

Another great fruit crumble recipe to use up apples when you have that once a year glut.

===Ingredients===
| 2 cooking apples, peeled, cored and cut into slices
| A handful of seasonal mixed fruit or sultanas
| 1 tablespoon dark brown sugar or molasses
| 100g softened butter, diced, plus a little extra for greasing
| 140 g breadcrumbs
| 100 g cornflakes
| 100 g caster sugar, plus ½ teaspoon for dusting
| 25 g flaked almonds


===Mise en place===
* Preheat the oven to 200\u00b0 C (400\u00b0 F - gas 6)

===Method===


| Grease a suitable baking dish with butter
| Arrange the apples in layers
| Sprinkle over the mixed fruit and brown sugar
| Add the breadcrumbs to a bowl and mix with the cornflakes, scrunching them up as you go.  Add the butter and the sugar and knead into the breadcrumbs with your fingers.
| Spoon the crumble over the top of the fruit
| Sprinkle with the flaked almonds and dust with the extra sugar
| Bake for 30 minutes or until golden
===Serving suggestions===
Serve hot with homemade custard.

===Variations===
The original recipe called for rolled porridge oats, but I changed it to cornflakes as I remember my mum making crumble like this, many years ago.  This type of crumble does not hold together as well as a flour-type crumble, but it's all crunch and delicious.

A made in heaven fruit combination is to add a handful of topped and tailed blackcurrents to the apples before cooking, marvellous!
