===Description===

Smoked salmon lovers, here's a luxurious recipe that takes minutes to prepare and would serve as a wonderful starter or a tasty snack.  I've added this recipe as a cheat because it's so simple to make and requires no cooking.

===Ingredients===
| 225 g (8 oz) smoked salmon slices
| 1 ripe avocado
| 2 teaspoons lemon juice
| 50 g (20 oz) cream cheese
| 150 ml (1/4 pint) double cream, whipped
| Freshly ground black pepper
| 3 drops of Worcestershire sauce
'''garnish'''
* 4 tablespoons of sour cream
* Fresh dill leaves
* 2 slices of Brown bread and butter

===Method===


| Line 4 small ramekin dishes with slices of smoked salmon, leave a little aside to make lids.
| Add the avocado, lemon juice and cream cheese and mash to a puree.
| Fold in the whipped double cream and add the black pepper and Worcestershire sauce.
| Divide the mixture into four portions and fill the ramekin dishes, top with a cover of smoked salmon.  Chill in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes to firm up.
| Turn the timbales out onto serving plates, surround with  swirl of sour cream and sprinkle with dill.
===Serving suggestions===
Serve with brown bread and butter.
===Variations===
Try Tabasco or Louisiana hot pepper sauce instead of  Worcestershire sauce.
===Chef's notes===
I have made plenty of changes from the original recipe:

Because almost every ingredient in this recipe is so high in cholesterol I decided to omit the soured cream as a garnish altogether. I also reduced the size of the timbales by using a silicone muffin tray instead of ramekin dishes.  This made more, smaller timbales.

Because of the astronomical cost cost of sliced smoked salmon, I used 100 g of sliced smoked salmon and 120 g of smoked salmon trimmings (87p!) - these I sliced thinly and chopped with a very sharp knife.

As the avocado was not as ripe as it could have been, I mixed everything in a food processor with a sharp blade.  This whipped the cream, chopped the avocado to mush and mixed it up rather well.

After 6 'muffins' there was still a some filling and some smoked salmon trimmings left over.  These I mixed up into a small container and after chilling will probably make a rather fine spread - for breakfast maybe?
