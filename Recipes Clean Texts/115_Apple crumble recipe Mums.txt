===Description===

Another recipe from Mum's scribbled cookery notes, this recipe was one of her favourites.  As she grew older and more reliant on others, this was a treat she always asked me to make for her.

'''apple filling'''

===Method===



| Peel, core and slice the apples
| Add to a small pan together with the remaining filling ingredients and simmer gently for 10 minutes.
