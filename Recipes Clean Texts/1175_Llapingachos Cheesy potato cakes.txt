===Description===

This mountain dish from Ecuador can be served as a first course or as an accompaniment. These are very moorish!

===Ingredients===
| 900g potatoes, peeled and sliced
| Salt
| 60g butter
| 2 medium onions, finely chopped
| 225g Cheddar cheese, grated
| Yellow cornmeal for dusting
| Oil, butter or annatto oil, for frying
===Method===


| Boil the potatoes in salted water until soft.
| Drain and mash.
| Heat the butter and saut\u00e9 the onions.
| Add the onions to the mashed potatoes and mix well.
| Shape the potatoes into 12 balls.
| Divide the cheese into 12 parts and stuff each of the potato  balls with the cheese, flattening them as you do so into cakes or patties about 2.5cm thick.
| Roll them in a plate of yellow cornmeal
| Chill in the refrigerator for about 15 minutes.
| In enough butter or oil to cover the bottom of a frying pan, saut\u00e9 the potato cakes until they are golden brown on both sides.

They are this colour because I fried off the onions in oil coloured with annatto powder

===Serving suggestions===
Serve as a first course with lettuce and slices of avocado and tomato.

Serve as part of a main course with fried slices of fish such as bass with rice and salad.
===Variations===
The cheese can be mixed with the mashed potatoes rather than used as a stuffing.
===Chef's notes===
If you don't have annatto oil you can always blend a big pinch of annatto seeds and add the powder to the oil before frying.  It certainly gives them a nice colour.

I rolled mine in a little yellow cornmeal because I love the finish it gives to fried potatoes.
''Annatto seeds are used as colouring cheeses such as Cheddar, Red Leicester etc.''
