Pachamanca is the Quechua language word for a traditional Andean cooking technique, in which vegetables and meats are placed underground with very hot stones and slowly roasted.  (\"Pacha\" means \"earth\", and \"manca\" means \"pot\" in Quechua). To prepare it you need some open space. When you don't have it, you can prepare pachamanca in olla. It is cooked over the fire in a clay pot.

'''Note:'''  for the pachamanca - you can have one meat, two meats, or more!!!

===Chef's notes===
JuliaBalbilla has kindly done the following research into UK equivalents for some of the more difficult to obtain ingredients in this recipe.   Thank you Julia!
* Huacatay is a type of marigold and seeds can be obtained from:  '''[http://www.chilternseeds.co.uk/item_1222d_tagetes_minuta_seeds Chiltern Seeds]'''.  Looks like they kill off weeds as well!
* Chicha de Jora is a bit trickier as it is a drink made from corn.  There is a recipe for making it [http://www.ehow.com/how_2099371_make-chicha-de-jora.html here] , but I would suggest substituting it with a slightly sweetish white wine.
* Chincho leaves - I think they will be impossible to get here.  Seems they are related to huacatay and used to be used to treat malaria.  I wonder if our friend can come up with a substitute.
* Fava beans.  Broad beans in pods are not often available, so most of the year, it would have to be frozen and I presume we should allow for that when giving a weight.

''Thank you to our Peruvian visitor, Gloria Sebastiani for kindly providing this recipe''

Nowhere near me I can dig a fire pit to do this. A shame.
