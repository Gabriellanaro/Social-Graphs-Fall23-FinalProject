Not at all bad, but nothing like a baguette bought in a French bakery.

===Description===

'''The baguette''' ('''French stick''' or '''French loaf''') is a variety of French bread distinguishable by its much greater length than width, and noted for its very crispy crust. The standard girth size of a baguette is approx. 5 or 6 cm, but can be up to a meter in length.

French food laws define bread as a product containing only the following four ingredients: water, flour, yeast, and common salt; the addition of any other ingredient to the basic recipe requires the baker to use a different name for the final product. As a result, the traditional baguette is made from a very lean dough, made from a moderately soft flour. While a typical baguette is made with a direct addition of baker's yeast, it is not unusual for artisan-style loaves to be made with a poolish or other bread pre-ferment to increase flavour complexity, as well as the addition of whole wheat flour and other grains such as rye. French bread is required by law to avoid preservatives, and as a result baguettes quite frequently stale within a day of being baked.

This baguette recipe uses no fats or oils, it has a delicious light airy texture and can be made in a breadmaker.
