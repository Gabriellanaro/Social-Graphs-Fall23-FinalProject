===Description===

This is a meaty version of Baked Camembert.  Just take a wheel of Camembert (or any similar French cheese), cut it in two, pack into two ovenproof dishes, fill with crushed or sliced garlic, slosh on some Calvados, cover with salami or similar and bake for 30 minutes.  Eat by dipping vegetables, breadsticks, anything really!
