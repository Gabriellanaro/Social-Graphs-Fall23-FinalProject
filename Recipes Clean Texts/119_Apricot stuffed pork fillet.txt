===Description===

A different way to cook pork fillet, this version stuffed with dried apricots served in a creamy mushroom sauce.
===Ingredients===

| 1 whole pork fillet, about 500g (1 lb)
| 50 g (2 oz) dried apricots (chopped), soaked for 30 minutes in 3 tablespoons sherry if you have the time.
| 2 tablespoons freshly picked parsley, finely chopped.
| 8 freshly picked sage leaves plus a sprig for garnish.
| 1 tablespoon olive oil.
| 1 small onion, peeled and finely chopped.
| 2 cloves of garlic, peeled and crushed.
| 300 ml (1/2 pint) chicken stock or vegetable stock.
| 125g (4 oz) button mushrooms, thinly sliced.
| 2 tablespoons lemon juice or lime juice.
| 142 ml (5 fl oz) soured cream.
| 3 tablespoons of sherry (or the sherry that the apricots were soaked in).
| sea salt and freshly ground black pepper.


===Method===



| Butterfly the pork fillet lengthways. ''Cut it open like a book''.
| Flatten a little more using a rolling pin or a meat mallet.
| Season the inside with a little salt and pepper.
| Arrange the chopped apricots and chopped sage leaves along one side.
| Sprinkle with the chopped parsley.
| Close the ''book'' and secure with cocktail sticks or tie with fine string.
| Heat the tablespoon of olive oil in a large frying pan over a medium heat. Sprinkle with a little black pepper and brown the pork fillet, turning regularly so it colours evenly.
| Remove and keep warm.
| Add the chopped onions and garlic and saut\u00e9 until softened but not coloured.
| Add the stock, lime or lemon juice to the onions, add the meat and cover and simmer for 20 minutes.
| Add the sliced mushrooms and the sherry, stir well, cover and simmer for another 15 minutes.
| Remove the pork and discard the string or cocktail sticks, set to one side and keep warm.
| Stir in the soured cream and warm through.  Don't allow it to boil or it will separate.
| Slice the pork fillet into medallions and arrange on serving plates.
| Spoon the mushrooms and sauce over the pork.

====The best knot to tie kitchen twine single-handedly====
After much experimenting, I have discovered the best knot to tie kitchen twine on your own is the ''Surgeons' knot''.
===Chef's notes===
Follow the RSPCA Think Pig Checklist to make sure that your pork has come from pigs that have been reared to higher welfare standards.
