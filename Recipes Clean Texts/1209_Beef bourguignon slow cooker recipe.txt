===Description===

[[Image:Beef bourguignon in the slow cooker.jpg|thumb|300px|right|After 10 hours in the slow cooker]]
Beef bourguignon is a well-known, traditional French beef stew recipe. It is essentially a stew prepared with beef braised in a full bodied red wine and beef stock, generally flavoured with garlic, onions, carrots, and a bouquet garni, and garnished with pearl onions and mushrooms.

This version is especially for a slow cooker and can be prepared with no pre-cooking and will cook in 8 hours (or more) so can be left cooking all day, while you are out at work.

===Ingredients===
| 450 g Stewing steak, trimmed of excess fat and cut into bite-sized cubes
| 3 large carrots, sliced in half length-wise.
| 1 bottle of robust red wine such as Bulls blood.
| 225 ml beef stock made with 1 oxo cube
| Bouquet garni (I used a variation on version 4)
| half a lime (unsqueezed)
| 8 banana shallots, peeled and cut in half
| 150g of button mushrooms, sliced
| 3 carrots, scrubbed and sliced
| 2 sticks of celery cut into moons
| 110 g (4 oz) home smoked bacon or good quality smoked bacon
| 1 tablespoon of plain flour
| Pinch of salt
| Good pinch of freshly ground black pepper
| 6 small tomatoes cut in half
===Method===


| Season the flour with salt and pepper
| Roll the meat cubes in the flour to coat well - this will help to thicken the stew.
| Add the remaining ingredients to the slow cooker
| Stir well
| Cook on low for 8 hours or more. As an experiment, I left the stew as photographed for 10 hours (on low).

===Serving suggestion===

Often served with noodles, was also good with squash mash and garden peas. Also good with mashed potatoes.

===Variations===
If you have time beforehand, you can brown the whole shallots and the cubes of beef in a separate pan, before slow cooking. It adds a little colour and some extra flavour.  However, when testing this recipe, everything was tipped into the slow cooker, no pre-frying and the results were perfectly acceptable.
