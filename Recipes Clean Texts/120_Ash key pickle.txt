Ash key or Ashen key pickle is an ancient pickle made from the seeds of ''Fraxinus excelsior'' [European Ash or Common Ash]
An odd recipe that probably needs very young ash keys to guarantee a tender pickle.

This recipe comes from John Evelyn's study of vegetables, herbs and salads: 'Acetaria, a Discourse of Sallets, 1699'

===Procedure===

'''Gather them young, and boil them in three or four Waters to extract the Bitterness; and when they feel tender, prepare a Syrup of sharp White-wine vinegar, Sugar, and a little Water. Then boil them on a very quick Fire, and they will become of a green Colour, fit to be potted so soon as cold.'''
