Not sure which, but either way, this is brilliant.  I've made this again and again.

===Description===

This is just a bit of fun, as far as I am aware, there is no such thing as a Biarritz omelette, though perhaps there should be?  It was inspired by Biarritz potatoes and uses similar regional ingredients.  Having said that, and being a regular visitor to the area, I would say that duck rather than pork would probably be the meat of choice for this area.  Anyway, it was a very nice omelette

===Ingredients===
| Olive oil for frying
| 1 red pepper, roasted
| 200g Good quality cooked ham or gammon, chopped
| 4 fresh eggs
| sea salt and freshly ground black pepper


===Mise en place===
* Roast the red pepper, de-seed and rub most of the skin off, leaving a little of the burn skin for flavour.
===Method===


| Chop the roasted red pepper and ham
| Beat the eggs and add a pinch of salt
| ''Make 1 omelette per person''
| Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a large frying pan over a medium heat
| Add a grind of black pepper
| Pour in the egg mix and swirl the pan to distribute evenly
| Cook for a few minutes on one side only
| Once the edges start to solidify, tip in the ham and red peppers, the centre of the omelette should still be a little runny, see the picture
| Serve immediately by tipping it onto a warmed serving plate, folding it on top of itself
| By the time it gets to the table the 'runny' part will be perfectly cooked.
===Serving suggestions===
Serve with chips and beans.
===Chef's notes===
Follow the RSPCA Think Pig Checklist to make sure that your pork has come from pigs that have been reared to higher welfare standards.
