===Description===

[[Image:Biarritz potatoes recipe.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Surfing in Biarritz]]
Straight from the Aquitaine, where I must have spent 15 summers, surfing and windsurfing.  A wonderful area of France that the British seem to ignore. Markets and fresh produce everywhere, a great place for a holiday, unless it rains.  This dish is regularly cooked in the camper van!

===Ingredients===
| 900 g (2lb) floury potatoes such as Desiree, King Edward, Nadine, Saxon or Wilja.
| 50 g (1 oz) butter
| 90 ml (6 tablespoons) milk or single cream
| 1 large red pepper, deseeded and finely chopped, though a selection of colours tastes the same but looks nicer.
| 15 ml (1 tablespoon) fresh parsley, chopped
| sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
===Method===


| Peel the potatoes and cut into small chunks so they cook evenly
| Boil the potatoes in lightly salted water for 20 minutes or until very soft.
| Drain the potatoes and return to a low heat for a minute or two to dry out a little.
| Mash the potatoes or pass thorough a ricer, beat in the butter, milk and seasoning, then fold in the peppers and parsley.
===Variations===
Roast some garlic and squeeze the pure\u00e9 into the potatoes as you mash them.

Roast the peppers before chopping them.
===Serving suggestions===
Serve immediately
