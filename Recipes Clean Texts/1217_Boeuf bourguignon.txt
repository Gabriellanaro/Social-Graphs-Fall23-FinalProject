A bowl of this in front of a open fire is absolute bliss.

 

The Judge 




I have never made this traditional stew from Burgundy before, despite it being a 1970s classic in the UK.  Finally got around to it and my husband thought it was great!

'''For the overnight marinade'''
===Ingredients===
| 450g stewing steak, cubed
| 1-2 tablespoons dried mixed herbs
| 250ml gutsy red wine - perversely I used DO Valencia, a Spanish wine
| 1 tablespoon brandy
'''For the stew'''
===Ingredients===NB
| Plain flour, seasoned with salt and pepper
| 200g belly pork, skin removed and reserved, and meat cut into smallish pieces
| 1 tablespoon olive oil
| 120g pickled silverskin onions, well drained (you can use fresh, but not available where I live)
| 1 bulb garlic, finely diced
| 100g streaky bacon, diced
| 100g small button mushrooms, wiped and left whole
| Flat leaved parsley, coarsely chopped, to garnish
===Method===


| Place the marinade ingredients in a bowl and leave overnight in the fridge, covered.
| Remove the beef and marinade from the fridge and allow to come to room temperature.
| Drain off the marinade into a separate bowl and reserve.
| Dry the meat with kitchen paper and place in a further bowl.
| Lightly dredge with the seasoned flour (a flour dredger would be useful for this) and toss the beef in the flour.
| Cook the belly pork (minus the skin) in a non-stick casserole or deep frying pan until it starts to produce its own dripping.
| Remove the pork pieces and reserve.
| Add the olive oil, bring to a high-ish heat and add the beef.
| When the beef has browned on all sides, remove and reserve with the belly pork.
| Add the onions, garlic, bacon and mushrooms and cook until they start to colour.
| Add the reserved marinade, and boil until the smell of alcohol has disappeared.
| Add the reserved pork, beef and pork skin.
| Bring to the boil, then simmer on a low heat, covered, for 2-3 hours.
| About 15-20 minutes before the end, remove the lid and cook on a higher heat until the sauce has thickened.
| Serve, garnished with the chopped parsley.
===Serving suggestions===
You can serve with mashed potatoes and vegetables.  Alternatively, I served with rice cooked in beef stock, to which I then added butter and more chopped parsley.

===Chef's notes===
I used a titanium wok to cook this dish and it worked very well.
