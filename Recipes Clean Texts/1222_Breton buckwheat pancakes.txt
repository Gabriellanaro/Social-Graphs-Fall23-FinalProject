These pancakes (cr\u00eape or crepe) should be lacy and paper thin, they serve as a base for may filling, sweet or savoury.  because of the buckwheat flour they have a slightly nutty flavour.

===Ingredients===
| 250 g (9oz) buckwheat flour
| 60 g (2.5 oz) plain flour
| Pinch of table salt
| 2 large fresh eggs
| 900 ml (1.5 pints) water / milk mixed 50/50
| Vegetable oil for frying
===Method===


| Mix all of the dry ingredients in a bowl and knock a well in the middle
| Break the eggs into the well
| While beating with a wooden spoon, gradually add the liquid and mix until you have a light batter
| Leave to stand in a cool place for 2 hours if you have the time
| Heat a heavy based frying over a moderate heat and apply a very small film of oil; either by wiping with a lightly oiled paper towel or by using an oil spray
| Add a small ladle of batter and swirl the pan around to distribute the batter evenly
| Once the underside has been lightly browned (about 2 minutes), flip with a spatula and cook for a further 2 minutes
| Rinse and repeat, keeping the cooked pancakes warm in the oven
