===Description===

Avocado and goats' cheese, an interesting combination and being suitable for vegetarians it's another recipe idea for our Gent nights.  It would make a good starter or with some crusty bread would probably make a good main course.

Many thanks to those nice people at The Lubborn Creamery who gave us permission to reproduce this recipe.

===Ingredients===
| 12 small tomatoes, halved
| 2 cloves of garlic, crushed.
| 2 tablespoons olive oil.
| 4 tablespoons French dressing.
| 2 x 100g Capricorn Somerset Goats' cheese, chopped
| 2 tablespoons flat leaf parsley, chopped
| 2 ripe avocados
| 25g toasted pine nuts


===Mise en place===
* Preheat the grill to high.
===Method===


| Place the tomatoes and garlic on a baking tray and drizzle over the oil.
| Grill for 4-5 minutes, until just soft.
| Place the tomatoes in a bowl and mix together with the French dressing, Capricorn Somerset Goats' cheese and parsley.
| Peel, stone and slice the avocados.
| Fan the avocado slices onto a serving plate and spoon the tomato mixture onto the smaller end of the fan.
| Sprinkle over some toasted pine nuts.
