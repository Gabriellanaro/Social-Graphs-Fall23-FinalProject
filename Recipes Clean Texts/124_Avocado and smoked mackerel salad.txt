Avocado pears, flakes of smoked mackerel  and a zingy dressing make this salad idea for a summers day meal

Although this dish really should be served on one large dish, as we often want to use the remainder of the salad for another meal we serve the two separately.

| Handful fresh coriander leaves, chopped
| 1 tablespoon lemon juice

===Method===
'''Avocado salad'''

'''Mackerel salad'''

| Add the coriander leaves and allow to wilt
| Remove from heat and allow to cool

===Serving suggestions===

Serve both dishes chilled

===Chef's notes===
Don't be tempted to add salt as processed mackerel can be quite salty already, as can nam pla.
