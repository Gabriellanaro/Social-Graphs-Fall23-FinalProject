===Description===

[[Image:Caramelised-red-onion-sausages.png|300px|thumb|right|Debbie & Andrew's Caramelised Red Onion Pork Sausages]]
This allergy free gravy recipe was created by debbie&andrew's sausages and natural chef, Ceri Jones. It is a perfect accompaniment to their Caramelised Red onion Pork sausages.

This recipe is gluten free, wheat free, dairy free, does not contain nut or soy.

It is reproduced courtesy of debbie&andrew's sausages.
===Ingredients===

| 1 tablespoon olive oil
| 1 red onion, peeled and sliced
| 1 teaspoon honey
| 1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar 
| 125mls red wine
| 500mls beef stock 
| 1 tablespoon arrowroot, made into a thick paste (slurry) with 3 tablespoons water

===Method===


| Heat oil in a large frying pan. Add the red onion and cook on a low-medium heat for approximately 25 minutes, don\u0092t allow the onions to burn. After 25 minutes stir in a teaspoon of honey and cook for a further 5 minutes.
| Next, turn up the heat and pour in the vinegar, wine and beef stock. Bring to the boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 5 minutes.
| Finally add the arrowroot slurry, and stir well to thicken the gravy.
| Add a good twist of black pepper then taste and add salt if necessary. If your beef stock is already salted you won\u0092t need any more.
===Chef's notes===
Arrowroot is added at the end of cooking. If it overheats, its thickening powers will be obliterated.
