Luxurious, extravagant and rich, this dish, that originates from Dauphine in the French Alps, is simple and easy to cook - this version uses Philadelphia cream cheese.



===Ingredients===

| 3 medium potatoes, very thinly sliced
| 10 g butter
| 1 onion, thinly sliced
| 2 garlic cloves, crushed
| 150 g Philadelphia Original
| 200 ml s semi-skimmed milk
| Freshly ground black pepper
| 25 g gruyere (or low fat cheddar), finely grated


===Mise en place===

* 200\u00b0 C (400\u00b0 F - gas 6), [fan oven 180\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]
* Lightly grease a baking dish (16cm x 20cm)
===Method===



| Heat the butter in a medium saucepan. Stir in the onion and garlic.
| Cook over a low heat until starting to soften. Add the Philly and gradually stir in the milk, continue heating until just melted.

These potatoes are ok, but I'm not a fan of over-processed cheese.  Much nicer using a locally produced cheese.
