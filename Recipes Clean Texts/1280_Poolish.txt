===Description===

Poolish is a mother dough made from a mixture of flour and water, sometimes in the same proportions, sometimes with more water, to which no salt is added.  
It can be considered as being a half-way house between natural mother doughs and and those which use a normal amount of yeast, as the proportion of yeast used is quite low.

===Ingredients===
| 6 g fresh or 3 g dried yeast
| 320 g strong bread flour
| 360 ml water at room temperature
===Method===


| Place the ingredients in a bowl or food processor in the order given above and mix until you have a soft, sticky dough.
| Cover with cling film and leave for a minimum of 4 and a maximum of 72 hours at room temperature.
| If you wish to keep it longer, refrigerate.
===Variations===
You may find that you can get away with less yeast.
===Chef's notes===
The longer you leave the poolish to ferment, the better tasting your final bread will be.
