===Variations===
Mixing brandy with green cr\u00e8me de menthe, in place of white, yields a Green Hornet.

A \"vodka stinger\" uses vodka instead of brandy.

The Kremlin Colonel is made with fresh mint instead of cr\u00e8me de menthe, making it similar to a mint julep using vodka in place of bourbon whiskey.
