Find this a bit bland unless you add lots of cheese and chillies.

[[Image:Baked bean veggyloaf chips and salad.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Spooned out with chips and cucumber salad]]

A simple and easy vegetarian loaf that can be ready to eat in 45 minutes.around 30 minutes.

===Ingredients===

| 1 large 400g can of baked beans
| 1 medium onion, peeled and finely chopped
| 1 egg, beaten
| 1 cup (50g / 2 oz) breadcrumbs
| 1 teaspoon mixed herbs of chopped fresh herbs if available
| 1 teaspoon Marmite
| 1 tablespoon tomato puree or 2 tablespoons tomato ketchup
| 1 clove of garlic, peeled and crushed
| Pinch of salt and a good grind of black pepper
===Mise en place===

* Preheat the oven to 180\u00b0 C (350\u00b0 F - gas 4), [fan oven 160\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]

===Method===


| Mix all of the ingredients together.
| Tip into a greased 450g (1 lb) loaf tin lined with greaseproof paper.
| Bake for 30 minutes or firm to touch.
| If you want to slice this, you'll need to let it cool first, or you can just spoon out the beany goodness!
===Variations===
Use a selection of fresh herbs.  We had run out of onions when I wanted to make this again, so I used more garlic and ''lots'' of chopped fresh chives.

Sprinkle a handful of grated cheddar cheese and black pepper on the top, just before it goes in the oven.
