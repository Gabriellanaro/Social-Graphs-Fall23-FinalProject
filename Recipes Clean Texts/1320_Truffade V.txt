===Description===

This French-styled dish is traditionally made with Tomme or Cantal cheese but is equally as good made with Cheddar if you have to.

A great quick meal, supper or even snack.

===Ingredients===
| Olive oil or melted butter to grease the dish
| 1 large onion, peeled and sliced
| 675 g (1.5 lb) baking potatoes such as Cara, Estima, King Edwards, Marfona, Maris Piper or Vivaldi, '''very''' thinly sliced.
| 150 g (5 oz) hard cheese; Tomme (Alsace cheeses, Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes cheeses, Midi-Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es cheeses), Cantal, Gruy\u00e8re or Cheddar, grated.
| Freshly grated nutmeg
| sea salt and freshly ground black pepper


===Mise en place===
* Preheat the oven to 180\u00b0 C (350\u00b0 F - gas 4)
===Method===


| Grease the base of a shallow baking dish or roasting tin.
| Arrange a layer of onions in the base.
| Top with a layer of potatoes, then a layer of cheese.
| Finish with a final layer of potatoes topped with cheese.
| Dress with nutmeg, salt and pepper and a few dabs of butter or oil.
| Bake for 1 hour and ten minutes., remove and allow to rest for 5 minutes
| If using lardons, fry them for 4 minutes first and add them in layers with the potatoes and onions.
===Serving suggestions===
Serve hot, sliced into wedges with a green salad
===Variations===
Squeeze a bulb or two of roasted garlic in amongst the potatoes for a really special dish!
