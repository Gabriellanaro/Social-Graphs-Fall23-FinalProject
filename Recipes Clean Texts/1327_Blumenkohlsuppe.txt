German cauliflower soup.

===Ingredients===
| 1 small cauliflower, leaves removed and broken into florets.
| 1.2 litres vegetable stock
| 30 g butter
| 30 g plain flour
| 50 ml dry white wine
| 2 egg yolks, beaten
| Seasoning
| Freshly grated nutmeg
===Method===


| Boil the cauliflower in the stock until it is just cooked.
| Pur\u00e9e in blender or rub through a sieve.
| Return the the soup to the pan, reserving a little in a small bowl.
| Make a paste with the flour, butter and reserved soup and pour into the saucepan.
| Stir, still on the heat, and allow to thicken slightly.
| Just before serving, stir in the egg yolks and the wine, season to taste and gently heat through.
| Serve with a few twists of freshly grated nutmeg on the top.
===Serving suggestions===
Black pumpernickel or rye bread is a good accompaniment.
===Variations===
Some recipes for this soup also include cream, but personally I think it is rich enough without it.
