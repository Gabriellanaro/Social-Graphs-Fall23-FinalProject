===Description===

These baked winter squash cups filled with garlic camembert and pepperoni are like little hot pizzas. We had them with pillau rice, a great match.

You could use any small squash, especially butternut squashes and if you bake them in individual dishes you can even eat them straight from the bowls.

===Ingredients===

| 1 small winter squash
| 125g of Camembert cheese, ''half a box''
| 3 cloves of garlic
| 30 small pepperoni 'coins'
===Mise en place===

* Preheat your oven to 200\u00b0 C (400\u00b0 F - gas 6), [fan oven 180\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]

===Method===


| Halve the winter squashes from top to bottom, not width-wise.  This way the servings are equal.
| Scoop out the seeds and discard.
| Rinse the squash halves under running water and dry on a paper towel.
| Peel and thinly slice the garlic cloves.
| Quarter the camembert and  push the garlic slices into the cheese.
| Line the 'cups' with a layer of pepperoni 'coins'.
| Press the garlic camembert into the 'cups'.
| Cover with the remaining pepperoni.
| Bake for one hour
