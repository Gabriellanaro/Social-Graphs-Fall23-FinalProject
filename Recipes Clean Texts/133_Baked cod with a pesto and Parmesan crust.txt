Now that Atlantic cod has now been declared a sustainable species after many years of being on the 'danger' list, it's time to start cooking with it again.

This recipe is a simple variation on a very similar recipe using tapenade instead of pesto.

It's a nice healthy recipe as it's baked rather than being fried. I'm serving it with puy lentils in home-grown leeks and garlic with the last of this season's Sungold tomatoes.
===Ingredients===

| 2 cod steaks of around 250g or once large 500g steak cut in two
| 5 heaped tablespoons of breadcrumbs
| 5 tablespoons freshly grated parmesan cheese
| 80g pesto - about 3 tablespoons
| Olive oil
| Freshly ground black pepper
===Mise en place===

* Check and remove any pin-bones from the cod fillets
* Preheat the oven to 180\u00b0 C (350\u00b0 F - gas 4), [fan oven 160\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]

===Method===


| Put the breadcrumbs into a bowl and add the grated Parmesan and the pesto together with a tablespoon of olive oil and a pinch of black pepper and mix well to combine.
| Lightly brush or spray a baking tray with olive oil and lay the fillets on the tray skin side down.
| Spread the top of each one fillet with the breadcrumb mixture.
| Bake for 20 minutes and finish under the grill for a few minutes for a crispy topping watching it carefully to see it does not burn.
===Serving suggestions===
