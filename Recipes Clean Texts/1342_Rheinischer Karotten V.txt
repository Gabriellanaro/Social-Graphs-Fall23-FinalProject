Carrots with apples.

===Ingredients===
| 500 g carrots. Scraped and thickly julienned
| Pinch of sugar
| 2 onions, peeled and sliced
| Sunflower oil
| 250 g cooking apples, peeled, cored and sliced, (a couple of large apples).
| Salt and pepper
| Lemon juice
===Method===


| Boil the carrots with the sugar in just enough water to cover, until tender.
| Meanwhile, fry the onions in the oil until golden.
| To the cooked onions, add the apples, carrots and the some of the water in which they have been cooking.  The mixture needs to be wet but not swimming in water.  the apples will also release a little moisture too.
