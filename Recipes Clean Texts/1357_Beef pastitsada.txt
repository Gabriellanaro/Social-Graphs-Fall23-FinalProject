Not surprising really.  Greece is but a short boat trip from Italy.  This is lovely.

[[Image:Beef pastitsada with allspice and red wine recipe.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Greek pastitsada]]
A traditional Greek dish, specifically from Corfu, I believe.  Slow cooked for tenderness.

===Ingredients===
| 2 tablespoons olive oil
| 800 g braising steak
| 12 shallots, peeled
| 250 ml red wine
| 250 g baby carrots, scrubbed and trimmed
| 2 teaspoons ground allspice
| a good pinch of ground cinnamon
| 2 large (400 g) cans tinned tomatoes, chopped
| 3 cloves garlic, peeled and crushed


===Mise en place===
* Preheat the oven to 150\u00b0 C (300\u00b0 F - gas 2)
===Method===


| In a large oven proof dish, heat the olive oil and brown the meat for 5 minutes, remove and reserve. Do this in small batches or you will just end up with boiled meat.
| Add the shallots to the pan and saut\u00e9 for 4 minutes to colour
| Return the beef to the dish and deglaze the pan with the wine and a wooden spatula
| Add the remaining ingredients and mix well
| So there is a really good seal, cover with tin-foil then replace the lid
| Place in the oven and slow-cook for 3½ hours
===Serving suggestions===
Serve hot with pasta or noodles and fresh green vegetables such as broccoli or green beans
===Chef's notes===
This dish could also be made with veal, chicken or even Lobster.

Unless you are a big fan of cinnamon and cloves you might want to reduce the allspice to 1 teaspoon.
===Variations===
Greek beef stew with noodles (slow cooker recipe) is an variation of this recipe adapted for cooking in a slow cooker.
