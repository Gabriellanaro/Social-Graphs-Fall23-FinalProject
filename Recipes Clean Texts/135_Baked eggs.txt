As a rule eggs are not usually cooked alone by baking as there is no specific benefit and it is inefficient.  They are usually baked together with other items such as kippers, vegetables, mushrooms.

I don't currently have a specific recipe for baked eggs however, I though oven temperatures and times would be useful. 

===Oven temperatures and cooking times===
* 177\u00b0 C (350\u00b0 F - Gas 4 - Moderate/Medium) :- Bake for 10 to 15 minutes in an exposed container
* 204\u00b0 C (400\u00b0 F - Gas 6 - Moderately hot) :- Bake for 8 to 10 minutes in an exposed container
