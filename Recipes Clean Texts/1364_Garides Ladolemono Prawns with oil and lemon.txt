===Description===

A simple Greek prawn recipe

===Ingredients===
| 1 kg prawns, cleaned, but with shells left on
| 1 litre water or fish stock
| 1 stick of celery, chopped
| 1 small onion, diced
| Juice of 1½ lemons
| Salt and pepper
| 125 ml olive oil
| ½ teaspoon dijon mustard
===Method===


| In a saucepan, place the water, celery, onion, the juice of ½ a lemon and a pinch of salt.
| Boil for 10 minutes.
| Add the prawns and simmer for a further 10 minutes.
| Meanwhile, to make the dressing, put the juice of 1 lemon, seasoning, olive oil and mustard into a jar and shake until thoroughly mixed.
| Drain the prawn mixture and pour the dressing over it whilst still warm.
===Serving suggestions===
Serve with crisp lettuce and bread.
===Variations===
Try this with any small shellfish.
===Chef's note===
Not for the first time, when I made this, I didn't read the recipe properly and didn't realise that the accompanying vegetables were to be consumed with the prawns, so cut the celery lazily, and as I had no carrots, omitted them and increased parsley and celery leaves to compensate.  It was very nice, even so.

When making it again, I would use the largest seafood that you can find or you'll spend most of the time peeling, rather than eating.  Nice though, and the leftover dressing went well with a few more salads.
