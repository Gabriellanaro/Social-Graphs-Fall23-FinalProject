===Description===

My favourite savoury nibbles are a mix of spicy cashew nuts and roasted sweet corn kernels.  I just love the flavour the combination and the nice crunch they have - so I thought I should try and use this mixture to make a crisp coating for fresh fish.  Rather than deep fry or even pan fry them, I thought I would bake them.

This worked really well and would be equally good on meaty steaks too.
===Ingredients===

| About half a cup of mixed cashew nuts and roasted sweet corn kernels
| ''I used Natco Spicy cashew nuts & Natco roasted salted toasted corn - both available from Morrisons (UK)'' 
| A tablespoon of masa harina to loosen the mixture when grinding (plain flour would be fine)
| 2 medium sized hake fillet steaks
| 2 eggs, beaten
| 3 tablespoons plain flour for dredging
===Mise en place===

* Preheat your oven to 180\u00b0 C (350\u00b0 F - gas 4), [fan oven 160\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]

===Method===


| Add the cashew nuts and sweet corn kernels to a food processor with a metal blade
| Grind the mixture to a coarse powder
| You may find the mixture starts to clump together after a while - I guess this is because of the oil released from the sweet corn kernels
| If this does occur, just add a tablespoons of masa harina (or plain flour) and blitz the mixture for a few seconds to separate the crumbs again
| Prepare your 'coating station' by beating the eggs and adding to a bowl
| Pop the flour in saucer large enough to accommodate the fillets and finally the ground nut mixture in another saucer
| Dredge the fish fillets in the flour, dip in the beaten egg to coat and then press into the nut mixture ensuring the fish is well coated.
| Carefully arrange the coated fish on a grill tray and bake for 15 minutes or until the coating turns golden
===Serving suggestions===
Serve with chips, peas and garlic mayonnaise.

I much prefer proper fish shop chips to oven chips and don't deep fry at home so I've cheated by using chips bought a few hours earlier that were reheated in another oven tray while the fish baked.
===Variations===
Try this with any type of boneless fish fillet, chicken fillets, meat steaks and even burgers.
