It comes from Russell' The Butchers, in Upwell. The best there is - I can even hear them in the mornings! Baaaa!

===Description===

So simple to make, this is hardly a recipe.  I think these are much nicer if they are given time to marinade, but you could cook them immediately if you were pushed for time.

I've used Tex-Mex mix as the spicy base for these, but any mix of spices would be fine.  If using chili powder, just use a level teaspoon or they might be too hot.

===Ingredients===

| 1 lamb tenderloin fillet
| 2 tablespoons olive oil
| 2 tablespoons of lemon juice
| 2 teaspoons Tex-Mex mix or 1 scant teaspoon chili powder and a pinch of mixed herbs
| Pinch of salt
| Freshly ground black pepper
| 1 small red onion, halved
| 2 halved sweet peppers (different colours) - use the remains in your salad
'''to serve'''
===Ingredients===NB
| 180g Mixed salad
| 4 Pitta breads
===Mise en place===

* Preheat the grill or barbecue

| Place them in a Lock and Lock box together with the olive oil, lemon juice, Tex-Mex mix, salt and pepper

| Brush with a little extra olive oil and grill for about 10 minutes under a hot grill or barbecue.

| Rest for 5 minutes before serving
