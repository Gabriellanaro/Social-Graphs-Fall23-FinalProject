===Description===

Although this was the my first attempt at moussaka in 40 years of cooking, it was described as being 'delicious' (with an expletive preceding it).  I have no idea how authentic it is though.

| In the meantime, heat the tin of chopped tomatoes.
| Place half of the aubergine into mince mixture into the bottom of a baking dish.
| Then add half of the tomatoes and half of the mince.
