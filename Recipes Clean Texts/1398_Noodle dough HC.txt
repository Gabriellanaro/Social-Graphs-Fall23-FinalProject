===Description===

Noodle dough for soup


===Ingredients===
| 9 oz [255 g] flour
| salt
| 2 free range eggs
===Method===


| Make a stiff dough of the flour with rather less than a gill [140 ml] of water the eggs and a little salt.  Knead well on the baking-board, let it lie there a little, then roll out as thin as desired - usually about the thickness of a penny [2 pence piece is about right].
| Leave it to dry a little, then dredge the rolled out dough with flour, roll up and cut across in noodles of the required width.  
| Shake the noodles to prevent them sticking.
| Shortly before they are required drop them into boiling water, boil till they rise to the surface, rinse them in cold water and put them into the soup.
===Variations===
The same dough if rolled out thicker may be used as a garnish with any kind of meat that has plenty of gravy, or may be served instead of a pudding with butter, semolina, cabbage, curds, jam, poppy seeds, walnuts, cheese, and so on.
