===Description===


A refreshing Algerian salad with peppers, herbs, cucumber and cheese.

===Ingredients===
| 225 g bulghur wheat
| 300 ml boiling water
| 4 tablespoons olive oil
| 3 tablespoons lemon juice
| 2 tablespoons mint, chopped
| 3 tablespoons coriander, chopped
| 1 red pepper, peeled and cut into strips
| 1 bunch spring onions, chopped
| Garlic to taste, chopped
| ½ cucumber, coarsely chopped
| 115 g Feta or Caerphilly cheese, crumbled
| Salt and black pepper, to taste
| Lime wedges, to garnish
===Method===


| Place the bulghur wheat in a with the boiling water and leave to soak for 30 minutes. 
| Stir occasionally with a fork, until all the water has been absorbed.
| Meanwhile, mix together the oil, lemon juice and seasonings in a bowl. 
| Pour this over the bulghur wheat mixture and stir to combine. 
| Add the herbs, mix well, then add the remaining ingredients. 
| Toss to combine then cover and chill until needed. 
| Serve in a bowl, garnished with the lime wedges.
===Variations===
I would probably add a chilli or two to the salad.

I used vegetable stock instead of water, added 3 cloves of crushed garlic to the wheat at the soaking stage so the harshness of raw garlic was removed.  
I found some nice fresh sorrel leaves whilst herb-hunting in the garden so added those too along with a spare tomato.  A very nice and colourful salad which will be made again. --Chef 07:36, 6 March 2011 (GMT)
===Chef's notes===
When making this as a main meal for two people, I used 200g of bulgur wheat, vegetables as listed and an unmeasured quantity of cheese and there was very little left over.  I would be tempted to increase the amount of bulgur wheat if making this for four people.
