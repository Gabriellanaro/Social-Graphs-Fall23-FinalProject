===Method===


| Cook the potatoes for about twenty five minutes.
| Put a little olive oil in the bowl.
| Peel the potatoes and the eggs.
| Slice eggs, potatoes (and kolbasz if you wish) into slices and arrange in alternating layers of potatoes, eggs. salt or kolbasz in the bowl. Spread the olive oil over the dish and top with Smetena sour cream.
