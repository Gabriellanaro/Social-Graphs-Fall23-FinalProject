===Description===

I saw Nigella doing a pan-fried version of this and thought it would be worth doing a similar recipe for an air-fryer.  I have chosen my own mix of spices; all the seeds are left whole for this.

If you don't have an airfryer this could just as easily be done as a pan-fried dish, probably reduce the size of the potato chunks and also reduce the cooking time slightly too.
===Ingredients===

| 900g Cara potatoes, peeled and cut into chunks, about half the size of a small roast potato
| 3 cloves of garlic, peeled and sliced
| 2 tablespoons olive oil
| 1 teaspoon ghee
====spice mixture====
===Ingredients===NB
| 1 thin green indian chilli, deseeded and chopped
| Pinch of sea salt
| ½ teaspoon turmeric powder
| 1 teaspoon black mustard seeds
| ½ teaspoon white cumin seeds
| ½ teaspoon black cumin seeds
| ½ teaspoon nigella seeds
| ½ teaspoon fennel seeds
| 1 teaspoon coriander seeds
| ½ teaspoon fenugreek seeds

===Method===


| Add the olive oil, potatoes and garlic to your air-fryer
| ''This recipe is best suited to a paddle-type air fryer, otherwise you are going to have to keep mixing the potatoes very often''
| Set the air-fryer to the about 200\u00b0 C
| Cook them for 20 minutes
| After 20 minutes shake in all of the spice mixture and cook for a further 10 to 20 minutes until they are slightly crispy
| Serve  immediately

===Serving suggestions===
We've served this with sausages, eggs and baked beans as a sort of spicy chip substitute but these will accompany most dishes perfectly.
===Recipe source===

* Based on a recipe I saw Nigella Lawson doing on her TV program.
===Variations===
We've used Car potatoes as  they are in season and very good for air-frying; use your favourite potatoes or what is available.  new potatoes or waxy are not ideal for this dish.
