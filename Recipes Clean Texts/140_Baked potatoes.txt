A lot of work for a jacket spud but totally worth it.  It's the only way to bake a spud.

===Description===

Follow the strange method below and I will guarantee perfect jacket potatoes, every time. Crunchy, crisp skins with perfectly cooked centres.
* Use the right potatoes - see list at the bottom of the page
* Prick them all over with a fork
* Salt them for 2 hours or more
* Wipe off any excess salt.
* Pat them dry on a paper towel.
* Bake for 1 to 1.5 hours

===Ingredients===
| 4 large potatoes, 275-350 g (10-12 oz ) each (see list of suitable varieties below)
| 4 tablespoons Olive oil
| 4 teaspoons Butter
| Sea salt

===Mise en place===

* Preheat the oven to 220\u00b0 C (425\u00b0 F) (Gas 7)

===Method===


| Wash and thoroughly dry the potatoes
| Prick all over with a fork so there are holes everywhere, this makes it easy for the water to drain and the skin to become crunchy.
| Rub with a little olive oil and lots of sea salt to draw out the water and leave for 2 hours or more.
| Preheat the oven to 220\u00b0 C  (425\u00b0 F) (Gas 7)
| Rinse off most of the excess sea salt and pat dry before cooking.  It's job of drawing out moisture from the skin has been done.
| Place on a rack in the centre of the oven until the skins are crisp (1 to 1.5 hours)
| Make a cross in the top of the potato, wrap with a cloth and squash it to break up the flesh inside
===Servings===
275-350 g (10-12 oz ) potatoes per person
===Serving suggestions===

Serve immediately with sea salt and a knob of butter
===Variations===

Serve with sour cream and chopped chives
