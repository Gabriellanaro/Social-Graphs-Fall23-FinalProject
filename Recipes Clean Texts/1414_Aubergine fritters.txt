===Description===

These  fritters. are the Indian, not the European version - so I guess it should have been titled Brinjal fritters.  Great as a combination of starters.

===Ingredients===
| 4 aubergines, cut into slices 2 cm (¾\u201d)
| Oil for frying
| '''for the batter'''
| 100 g gram flour
| 75 ml (2.5 fl oz) water
| 25 g self-raising flour
| ½ teaspoon chili powder
| A pinch of garlic powder
| sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
===Method===


| Add the batter ingredients into a bowl and whisk to a smooth batter
| Refrigerate and allow to rest for at least 2 hours
| Heat the oil in a large pan or wok, once a piece of bread browns in 10 seconds it is ready
| Dip the slices in the batter and fry, a few at a time, until they are golden brown
| Drain and blot any excess oil on kitchen paper
| Keep warm until they are all cooked
===Serving suggestions===
