===Description===

This delicious hot and spicy curry just needs a paratha and cucumber raita.  This is a fabulous meal, for us it had just the right amount of heat and spices.  The leeks make an interesting change in a curry. 

===Ingredients===
| 75 g split red lentils
| 4 tablespoons ghee or corn oil
| 1 heaped  teaspoon black mustard seeds
| A large pinch of freshly ground black pepper
| 2 medium leeks, washed and chopped
| 4 Indian green chillies or a mix or red and green, split down the middle.  These types of chillies keep brilliantly in the freezer. 
| 4 curry leaves, a few bay leaves will do as a poor substitute
| Juice and grated zest of 1 lemon
| 2 large tomatoes, chopped
| 1 teaspoon of curry powder
| 1 teaspoon of turmeric
| 2 teaspoons coriander seeds, ground
| 1 teaspoon sea salt
| 450 g whole chicken, skinned, boned and cut into cubes
| Freshly chopped coriander leaves to garnish


===Mise en place===
Place the chicken pieces, lemon juice and zest in a Lock & Lock box, give then a good shake and leave to marinade in a cool place fo a few hours or more, if you have the time.  Leave the lemon pieces in while the chicken marinates and discard them before cooking

===Method===


| ''Wash the lentils carefully and pick over them to remove any stones'', is always advised on lentil recipes, though I have yet to find any pebbles in my lentils.  I guess food standards have improved since the first Indian recipes were penned!
| Place the lentils in a pan with just enough cold water to cover
| Bring to the boil, cover and simmer vigorously until soft, about 10 minutes, but it does depend on the type of lentils you are using
| Most of the water should have been absorbed, keep a few tablespoons of the cooking liquor to loosen the curry a little.  Set the lentils to one side
| Add the ghee or oil to a wok together with the black pepper and the mustard seeds and bring it to a medium heat
| As soon as the mustard seeds start to pop, quickly add the leeks, chillies, curry leaves and and stir-fry gently for 3 to 4 minutes
| Add the chicken pieces, together with the lemon juice and stir-fry for 7 minutes
| Tip in the chopped tomatoes, curry powder, ground coriander, turmeric, mix well and cook for a few minutes more
| Mix in the cooked lentils with enough of the cooking liquor to loosen the curry
| Heat and stir until the chicken is properly cooked, this should probably take another 10 minutes
