A clever idea as I just love coconut, and basa.

===Description===

This is a variation on ''Fish in red chilli chutney'' taken from Mr Pushpash Pent's wonderful \"India\" recipe book:  ISBN 978-0714859026.

===Ingredients===

| 750 g skinless basa fillets
| 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
'''marinade'''
===Ingredients===NB
| 1 teaspoon ground turmeric powder
| 6 cloves of garlic, peeled and crushed
| 1 tablespoon lime juice
| 1 teaspoon muscovado sugar
'''red chilli paste'''
===Ingredients===NB
| 3 dried Chile de Arbole
| 40g (1.5 oz) desiccated coconut
| 1 tablespoon of coconut block dissolved in a tablespoon of boiling water
| 1 tablespoon white wine vinegar (''no more'')
| 1 teaspoon vegetable oil
| Pinch of salt


===Mise en place===

* Mix the marinade ingredients together and coat the fillets well on both sides.
* Refrigerate for 1 hour or more to allow the flavours to mingle.  The longer, the better!
===Method===



| Add the chilles, desiccated coconut and vinegar, salt & vegetable oil to a food processor or mortar and pestle and grind to a fine paste.
| If the mixture is too dry, add a little water, drop-by-drop.
| Heat the oil in a frying pan and stir-fry the chilli paste for a minute or so.
| Reduce the heat and add the basa and 120 ml of hot water.
| Simmer vigorously for 8 minutes or until the fish flakes easily and most of the liquid has been reduced.

* Idea taken from Mr Pushpash Pent's wonderful \"India\":  ISBN 978-0714859026.
===Variations===
Any firm bodied fish fillets

Using 6 birds eye chilles instead of the Chile de Arbole is likely to be more authentic, i just happen to prefer chile de arbole.
