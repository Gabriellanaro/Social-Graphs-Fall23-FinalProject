This is my effort at making a basic sauce for restaurant style curries.  The following quantity is for 8 people, as you may wish to freeze some for a later date.

===Ingredients===
| 120 ml vegetable oil
| 950 g or about 8 cooking onions, thinly sliced
| 175 g (about 3-4 bulbs) garlic, diced 
| 50 g ginger, peeled and diced
| 1.5 litres water
| 2 good teaspoons salt
| 1 additional tablespoon vegetable oil
| 1 teaspoon turmeric
| 1 teaspoon fenugreek 
| 1 teaspoon chilli
| 1 teaspoon cumin
| 1 teaspoon coriander
| 1 teaspoon cardamom
| 1 teaspoon tomato pur\u00e9e
| 1 tin chopped tomatoes, pur\u00e9ed

===Method===

'''Stage 1'''
#Heat the oil over a medium-high heat.
#Add the onion slices and fry for about 10 minutes, until they are starting to brown, and even stick slightly.
#Stir vigorously, add the garlic and ginger and cook for a further few minutes until softened.
#Add the water and blend thoroughly - the mixture must be absolutely smooth.
#Add the salt, bring to the boil and turn down the heat to low.
#Simmer, covered, for 40-45 minutes and allow to cool.
#If you wish to freeze the sauce, do so at this stage.
'''Stage 2'''
# Meanwhile, heat the 1 additional tablespoon vegetable oil in a clean pan, add the spices and tomato pur\u00e9e cook for about a minute - no longer.
#Add the tomatoes, bring to the boil , reduce heat and cook for about 10 minutes.
#Skim, allow to cool and refrigerate for up to 4 days.
===Variations===
Combine spices to your taste.
===Chef's notes===
Make your the sauce two to three days in advance and refrigerate. This will improve the flavour and gives more of a restaurant aroma.
