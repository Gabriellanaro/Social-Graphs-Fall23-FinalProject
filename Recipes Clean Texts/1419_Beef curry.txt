===Description===

Another tasty curry from my early Indian cookery courses.

You can vary the flavours to suit your taste, but this recipe is a good starting point.

===Ingredients===
| 675 g (1.5 lb) of Braising steak, cut into thin strips
| 2 teaspoons coriander seeds
| 1 teaspoon turmeric powder
| ½ teaspoon chili powder
| ½ teaspoon fenugreek seeds
| 1 teaspoon cumin seeds
| ½ teaspoon peppercorns
| 4 cloves garlic, peeled and crushed
| 2.5 cm (1\") peeled ginger, ½ grated, ½ julienned (cut into very thin strips)
| 6 curry leaves
| 50g slice of coconut block
| 2 large onions, peeled and slices
| 1 can of tomatoes or equivalent amount of fresh tomatoes
| 1 green chilli, chopped finely
| 1 tablespoon malt vinegar
| 2 tablespoons ghee, oil or butter


===Mise en place===
* Grind all of the whole spices, except for the curry leaves,  to a powder in a coffee grinder or pestle and mortar.

===Method===


| Add the oil to a heavy frying pan or wok, brown the meat quickly over a high heat, remove and reserve.
| Fry the onions, garlic and grated ginger until the onions are sort, about 8 minutes.
| Add the ground spices and fry for a minute more.
| Stir in the tomatoes, vinegar and julienned ginger and mix well.
| Cover and cook until the meat is tender, about 30 to 40 minutes.  If the meat is still tough, add ½ a cup of boiling water and continue cooking for 20 minutes.
| Remove the cover, add the coconut block, green chilli mix well and cook until the coconut is dissolved.
===Serving suggestions===
Serve with plain boiled rice
===Variations===
Add cubed potatoes and a little extra liquid at the start.

If you don't have curry leaves, just use a couple of bay leaves.
