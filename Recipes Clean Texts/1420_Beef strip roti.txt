I would not think you would find this in India, but if you did you would enjoy it (secretly!)

Murghi roti is a South Indian style dish made with cooked rice, cooked chicken and lots of spices.  This another of my variations on this dish but using cooked strips of beef.  It is not the least bit authentic as the cow is sacred and forbidden as food in the Hindu religion of India.  I had about 250 g of ready cooked Sous vide beef prime topside joint so I thought I should try using it in this recipe.  It was delicious as always (Murghi roti is one of my all time favourite recipes), but I have to say I prefer the chicken version over beef.

A great recipe for using up leftovers.  Please be very careful if storing cooked rice.  Refrigerate the moment it has cooled and use within 1 day.

===Ingredients===
| 225 g (8 oz) uncooked basmati rice.
| 250g g (6 oz) cooked Sous vide beef prime topside joint cut into strips - any left over beef would be good also
| 2 tablespoons ghee or vegetable oil
| 5 fat garlic cloves, peeled and crushed
| 5 cm (2\") ginger, peeled and roughly grated
| 150 g (5 oz) onions, peeled and finely chopped
| 1 fresh coconut ,flesh removed and grated
|* see Preparing a coconut
| 4 hot chilli peppers (red or green), finely chopped - de-seeded if desired
| 1 tablespoon lime juice
| A bunch of coriander, chopped
'''spices'''

''The charm of this dish is the 'bite' of the whole spices, don't be tempted to grind them!''
* 2 teaspoons whole coriander seeds
* 1 teaspoon of whole cumin seeds (white)
* 1/2 a teaspoon of whole fenugreek seeds
* 1 teaspoon turmeric powder

===Method===


| Quickly wash and drain the rice but don't rinse it as you normally would, this dish is best with rice of a starchy consistency. 
| Cook in boiling water for 7 to 11 minutes.
| Rinse the cooked rice in cold water until it is cold.  Drain well.
| Add the rice to a food processor with a metal blade and blend to a thick creamy pur\u00e9e - adding a little milk if it needs thinning.  Remember, the inside is not going to change much whilst being cooked and will remain at roughly the same consistency as it was when first mixed. 
| Heat the ghee in a wok or frying pan and stir-fry all of the spices for half a minute, then add the ginger and garlic and allow them to cook for a minute or so.
| Add the onion and reduce the heat a little and let them cook until translucent; about 5 minutes.
| Add the beef, coconut and chilli to the onions, mix well and remove from the heat.
| In a large bowl add the rice and the onion mixture together with the chopped coriander and mix really well
| Lightly oil a large heavy non-stick oven proof frying pan put on a gentle heat.
| Ensure the mixture is evenly distributed and cook gently for about 5 minutes or until the rice cake has properly solidified.
| You can leave it as it is or mix it up as its cooking, pressing it flat again before you finally grill it.
| Preheat the grill.
| Pop the pan under the grill and grill for 10 minutes or until it is nicely browned.
| Sprinkle with lime juice and serve immediately.

Instead of fresh green chillies, I have used 3/4 teaspoon of diced ancho & 3/4 teaspoon diced chipotle (dried) chillies.

I heeded my own advice and tasted the coconut before preparing it.  It was totally rancid, thank you Morrisons.  Luckily I had both coconut flakes and desiccated coconut. For two people, I used two big handfuls of flakes and 4 tablespoons of desiccated coconut soaked in boiling water for 5 minutes then drained in a sieve.  It worked fine and saved the day!

===A better way of cooking this===
After making variants of this for many years, I've discovered the best method of cooking is to spread the ingredients out on a lightly greased baking tray and bake at 220\u00b0 C (425\u00b0 F - gas 7) for 35 minutes, stirring up the contents every 10 minutes.  It might be an idea with a meat other than crayfish, to add the meat (or prawns) for the last 10 minutes so they don't dry out.
