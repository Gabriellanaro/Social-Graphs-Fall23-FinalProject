Great idea and makes such a change from all those sugary popcorns.

Yet another variation on the popular snack.

I first got the urge to try flavoured popcorn when watching a now, long forgotten cartoon; as mummy dragon was about to go shopping, she warned the two baby dragons not to make garlic popcorn whilst she was gone.  Guess what they did next?

===Ingredients===
| 1.5 litres warm freshly popped corn
| 3 tablespoons butter
| ½ teaspoon sea salt
| ½ teaspoon sugar
| 1 or 2 teaspoons curry powder (to taste)
| 4 tablespoons toasted coconut 
| 4 tablespoons almond flakes, crushed
===Method===


| Put the popcorn in a large bowl
| Melt the butter and add the curry powder and mix well
| Pour the butter over the popcorn and shimmy the bowl to mix well
| Sprinkle with the remaining ingredients
| Mix well
===Serving suggestions===

Serve hot
