[[Image:Breadcrumbed curry chicken breasts on a rack.jpg|thumb|300px|right|On a rack, ready to be baked]]


We had half a pot of Greek yogurt going to waste in the fridge so I thought of an idea to use it up.  Although it looks dry without a sauce, the chicken was so juicy that it was fine without.

If you wanted to cook the marinade to use as a sauce, make sure it is properly cooked as it has been in contact with raw chicken.  The best way would be to put it in a dish in the oven with the chicken.

I use Cock Brand green curry paste - It's brilliant because it can be frozen so it keeps forever.  Even better, you can still scoop out a tablespoon of paste while it is still frozen.
===Ingredients===

| 250g Greek yogurt
| 1 heaped tablespoon curry paste
| 2 chicken breasts
| 8 tablespoons of Panko breadcrumbs
===Mise en place===

* Add the yogurt to a Lock and Lock box, stir in the curry paste and mix well add the [https://www.cookipedia.co.uk/cgi-bin/cc.pl?cftk=2#jump chicken breasts] and marinate for 12 hours or more.
* Shake to box every few hours if you have the chance.
* Preheat your oven to 180\u00b0 C (350\u00b0 F - gas 4), [fan oven 160\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]

===Method===


| After 12 hours marinating, remove the chicken breasts and allow most of the marinade to drip off.
| Add the breadcrumbs to a bowl and press the chicken breasts into the breadcrumbs to coat really well.
| Bake on a grill tray in the middle of the oven [ 180\u00b0 C (350\u00b0 F - gas 4) ] for 30 to 35 minutes or until the breadcrumbs are golden brown.
===Serving suggestions===
Serve with rice, peas and sweetcorn.
===Chef's notes===
Any yogurt would do, we just happened to have Greek yogurt in the fridge.
