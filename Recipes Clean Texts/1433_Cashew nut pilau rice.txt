[[Image:Cashew nut pilau rice ingredients.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The ingredients]]
A fragrant and slightly spicy rice which is ideal to serve with curries or to eat on its own as a snack.

===Ingredients===
| 225g basmati rice
| Up to 75 ml peanut oil
| 1 medium onion, sliced
| 2 bulbs garlic (or to taste), crushed
| 1 large carrot, coarsely grated
| 1 teaspoon of cumin seeds
| 2 teaspoons of ground coriander
| 2 teaspoons of black mustard seeds
| The seeds of 4 green cardamom pods
| 450ml warm vegetable stock
| 2 bay leaves
| 100g savoury cashew nuts
| Seasoning
| Coriander leaves, chopped (to garnish)
===Method===


| Soak the rice in cold water for at least 30 minutes, then drain well.
| Heat the oil in a saucepan, add the onion, carrot and garlic and cook gently for 3-4 minutes.
| Add the rice and spices and cook for a further 2 minutes, stirring constantly so that all the grains of rice are coated in the oil.
| Pour in the stock and add the bay leaves and seasoning.
| Bring to the boil, reduce the heat and simmer, covered, until the rice is cooked and has absorbed the liquid - about 12-15 minutes.
| Discard the bay leaves and stir in the nuts.
| Adjust seasoning and garnish with the coriander leaves.
===Variations===
Use any nuts you like and add chillies and/or other vegetables.  For extra piquancy, substitute the peanut oil with culinary mustard oil.
