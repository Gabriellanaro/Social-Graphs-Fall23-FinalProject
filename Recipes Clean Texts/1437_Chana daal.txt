A curry 'must-have'

Every curry needs this - a great dip for breads and it makes the meat go much further.

===Description===

| 50g from a block of creamed coconut
| ½ teaspoon freshly ground cumin
| ½ teaspoon chili powder
| ½ teaspoon turmeric powder
| ½ teaspoon freshly ground coriander seeds
| 1 teaspoon garam masala or curry powder
