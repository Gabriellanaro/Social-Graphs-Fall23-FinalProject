Chapati is a staple flat bread of North India and Western India. It is rather thin, unleavened cooked dough. It is a type of roti.

Whilst kneading dough can be therapeutic, if time is your enemy, then the food processor is your friend.

Chapatis are the perfect accompaniment to most Indian dishes.

===Ingredients===
| 1 cup whole wheat atta flour or strong whole wheat flour
| 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
| Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
| 2 tablespoons yogurt (optional) 
| Â½ cup water
===Method===


| Tip all of the ingredients and half of the water into the food processor with a plastic blade or dough hook attachment
| Blitz the mixture whilst adding a more water a little at a time until you have a soft, pliable dough that is not too sticky
| Remove from the processor, dust with a little flour and rest for 30 minutes in a bowl, covered with a damp tea-towel
| Divide into 6 equal parts and roll into balls
| With a rolling pin on a floured surface, roll each chapati out into a disc, about 2.5 mm (1/8 \") thick
| Without using any oil, heat a tava or frying pan until very hot
| Cook each chapati for about 2 minutes a side, they should puff up slightly
===Serving suggestions===
Keep warm whilst the remainder are cooked
