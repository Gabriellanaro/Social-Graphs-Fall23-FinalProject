A lot of work to make gravy but the effort is rewarded by the great taste.  A little goes a long way!

===Description===

This recipe will work without a caramelised roasting tray, but it won't be as rich or as tasty.  However, it does not have to be a meat roast.  Roast vegetables work just as well.  The vegetables shown were roasted with lots of garlic and cumin seeds so the resulting gravy had a delicious and unique flavour.

===Ingredients===
| A baking tray with remnants of a roast 
| A piece of meat or a range of vegetables
| A good glug of balsamic vinegar (about 6 tablespoons)
| 1 tablespoon (or to taste) of good vegetable stock powder, such as Marigold Swiss bouillon powder
| 284 ml boiling water
| 1 teaspoon gravy browning (optional)

===Method===


| Add the bouillon powder or cube and the gravy browning to the boiling water and mix well
| Remove the vegetables (or meat) from the roasting tray
| Place on the hob and turn to high
| Splash a good glug of balsamic vinegar onto the tray and with a flat spatula, deglaze the tray, scraping all of the caramelised goodness from the base
| Allow to bubble away for 30 seconds
| Pour in the stock mixture, stir well and heat until it thickens a little
| Strain through a sieve and serve immediately
