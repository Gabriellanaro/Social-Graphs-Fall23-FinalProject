===Description===

These spicy Indian cheese bhajis make a great starter, Tapa or snack.

===Ingredients===
| Vegetable oil for frying
| 3.5 tablespoons self-raising flour, sieved from a height over a bowl to aerate.
| 85g (3.5 oz) of cheddar or similar strong cheese.
| 2 free range eggs
| 1 teaspoon of garam masala

| 6 tablespoon milk
| 1 teaspoon of baking powder
| Rapeseed oil for frying

'''to serve'''
===Ingredients===NB
| Tomato ketchup
===Method===


| Add the eggs, milk, cheese and flour to a bowl and mix well until you have a smooth batter.
| Sprinkle in the baking powder, give a final mix and then leave in a cool place for 30 minutes for the baking powder to act.  Don't leave it any longer or the leavening effect of the baking powder will be lost.
| Add enough vegetable oil to a wok or frying pan to shallow fry
| Making 5 fritters at a time, add a tablespoon of batter to the pan for each fritter and cook until golden brown.
|Flip them and repeat for the other side.
|Remove and drain on paper towels
