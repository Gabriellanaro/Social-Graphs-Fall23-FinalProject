===Description===


A mildly spiced creamy curry.

===Ingredients===
| 1 medium onion (diced)
| 4 Chicken Breasts (cut into small chunks)
| 4 Tablespoons of Patak's Korma Paste
| 500ml Creme fraiche
===Method===


| Dice the onion and fry in a deep wok or frying pan until soft
| Add the chicken and stir until sealed
| Once chicken is sealed, add 4 heaped tablespoons of Patak's Korma Paste and stir until chicken and onion are thoroughly coated
| Once thoroughly coated, add the Creme Fraiche and stir until mixed well
| Turn down to a low heat and simmer uncovered for 30-40 minutes until chicken is tender
| The sauce will thicken - if it becomes too thick, add a small amount of cold water and stir thoroughly
