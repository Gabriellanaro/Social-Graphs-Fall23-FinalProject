===Description===

The vegetables shown were roasted with lots of garlic and cumin seeds so the resulting gravy had a delicious and unique flavour.

===Ingredients===
| A good glug of balsamic vinegar (about 6 tablespoons)
| 284mls (1/2 pint) boiling water
| 1 tablespoon (or to taste) of good vegetable stock powder, such as Marigold Swiss bouillon powder
| 1 teaspoon gravy browning (optional)
===Method===


| To a baking tray, add the bouillon powder or cube and the gravy browning to the boiling water and mix well
| Place on the hob and turn to high
| Splash a good glug of balsamic vinegar onto the tray and with a flat spatula, deglaze the tray, scraping all of the caramelised goodness from the base
| Allow to bubble away for 30 seconds
| Pour in the stock mixture, stir well and heat until it thickens a little
| Strain through a sieve and serve immediately
===Servings===
Serves 4 - Makes 284 ml (1/2 pint) of gravy
