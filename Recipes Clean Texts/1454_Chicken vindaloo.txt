===Description===

Vindaloo is an Indian curry dish popular in the region of Goa. The cuisine of the Mumbai based East Indians also includes a variation of the dish. However, it is known globally in its Anglo Indian form as a staple of curry house menus.  Make this one at home!

===Ingredients===
| 2 tablespoons of ghee or vegetable oil
| 2 medium onions, peeled and chopped
| 6 chicken pieces (legs or breast - skin removed)

'''marinade'''
* ½ teaspoon of salt
* ½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
* 1 teaspoon turmeric
* 4 whole cloves, ground
* ½ teaspoon cinnamon powder or ¾\" of rolled cinnamon stick, ground
* 1 teaspoon turmeric powder
* ½ teaspoon mustard powder
* 1 teaspoon of black mustard seeds
* 1 teaspoon chili powder (or to taste)
* 2 teaspoons paprika powder
* 1 teaspoon freshly ground cumin seeds
* 2 teaspoons tomato puree
* 2 teaspoons sugar
* ½ teaspoon ground fenugreek seeds
* 1\" ginger, grated
* 2 cloves of garlic
* 2 tablespoons brandy (sherry will do)
* 2 tablespoons malt vinegar (leftover red wine works)
* 1 whole dried chili, crushed

===Method===


| Make a paste with all of the marinade spices, brandy and vinegar
| Cut a few slashes right down to the bone in each piece to allow the marinade to penetrate.
| Put the marinade and the chicken pieces in a Lock and Lock-style box, fit the lid and shake like mad!
| Marinade overnight in a refrigerator
| Fry the onions in a tablespoon of ghee until brown
| Fry the meat for a few minutes with the onion
| Cover, lower the heat and cook gently for 35 to 40 minutes
| Add a little water or chicken stock if it starts to dry out.

===Chef's notes===

Recently made this with 3 large dried chile de \u00e1rbol (powdered) and no chilli powder.  It was warm and spicy with a bite, but not too hot.
