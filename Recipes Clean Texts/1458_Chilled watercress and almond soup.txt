Watercress gazpacho

 Paul R Smith 
===Description===

Just the thing for a hot July day.  To be taken in a shady corner of the garden, and then to sleep...

===Ingredients===
| 1 pint good quality chicken stock
| 4 spring onions(scallions), chopped on the diagonal
| 2 bunches fresh watercress, washed and chopped
| 6 mint leaves
| 6 fl oz (168 ml) milk
| 2 tablespoons ground almonds
| 4 fl oz (112 ml) single cream
| ½ teaspoon sea salt
| ¼ teaspoon ground white pepper
===Method===


| Skim any excess fat from the chicken stock
| Add to a large pan and bring to the boil, add the spring onions and watercress, reduce the heat and simmer gently
| Add a little of the milk to the ground almonds to make a paste and add the paste to the remaining milk
| Add the milk to the soup and once it has returned to a simmer, stir until the soup begins to thicken slightly
| Remove from the heat and allow to cool
| Once cool enough, blend the soup in a food processor
| Season to taste with salt and pepper
| Chill in the fridge until ready to serve
===Serving suggestions===

Serve cold in bowls.  Give each bowl a stir as you add the cream to get an arty swirl. Garnish with a mint leaf
