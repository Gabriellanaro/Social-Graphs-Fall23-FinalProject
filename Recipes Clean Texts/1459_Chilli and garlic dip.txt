This can be served as a dip and a sauce.  It is fairly hot.

===Ingredients===
| 3 tablespoons olive oil
| 1 bulb garlic, peeled and chopped
| 1 fresh, red chilli, chopped (leave the seeds in)
| 1 small red pepper, chopped
| 1Â½ teaspoon bird's eye chilli paste
| 1 tablespoon tomato pur\u00e9e
| 6 tablespoons mayonnaise
===Method===


| Heat the oil in a small saucepan over a medium heat and fry the garlic until it is soft.
| Stir in the chilli and red pepper and saut\u00e9 for about a minute.
| Add the chilli paste and the tomato pur\u00e9e and cook for 5 minutes gently stirring constantly.
| Remove from the heat and allow to cool.
| Transfer the mixture to a blender and process until it is smooth.
| Pour into an airtight container and mix in the mayonnaise.
| It will keep in the fridge for a few days.
===Chef's notes===
If you are using homemade mayonnaise, I find that the dip has a softer and better texture if the mayonnaise is made with whole eggs, rather that just the yolks.
