This is another variation on one of my '''most favourite spicy recipes'''.  Crayfish work exceptionally well in this recipe as they don't seem to dry out in the high heat.

The other roti recipes in the ''see also'' section were prepared in a frying pan.  This time I used a large grill tray, a far better method.  It allows the rice to ''just'' crisp up a little, leaving very little stodgy rice.

Please be very careful if storing cooked rice.  Refrigerate the moment it has cooled and use within 1 day

===Ingredients===
| 170 g uncooked basmati rice.
| 240 g Crayfish tails (2 packs)
| 2 tablespoons ghee or vegetable oil
| 5 fat garlic cloves, peeled and crushed
| 5 cm (2\") ginger, peeled and roughly grated
| 75 g (5 oz) onions, peeled and finely chopped
| 1 fresh coconut, flesh grated - don't be too precise with the grating, it's quite nice to have some meaty chunks mixed in.
| 4 hot chilli peppers (2 red, 2 green), finely chopped - 2 with seeds, 2 partially deseeded worked very well for us. (quite spicy)
'''spices'''

''don't grind the spices, leave them whole''
* 2 teaspoons whole coriander seeds
* 1 teaspoon whole cumin seeds (white)
* 1 teaspoon whole fenugreek seeds
* 1 teaspoon turmeric powder
'''to serve'''
===Ingredients===NB| 6 small cherry tomatoes, halved
| 1 tablespoon lime juice
| Fresh basil leaves, chopped or roughly torn.

===Mise en place===
Preheat your oven to 220\u00b0 C (425\u00b0 F - gas 7), [fan oven 200\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]

Place a lightly oiled baking tray in the top third of the oven
===Method===


| Quickly wash and drain the rice but don't rinse it as you normally would, this dish is best with rice of a starchy consistency. 
| Cook in boiling water until it just has a little ''bite'' left.  About 7 to 11 minutes.
| Rinse the cooked rice in cold water until it is cold.  Drain well.
| Add the rice and the turmeric powder to a food processor with a metal blade and blend to a thick creamy pur\u00e9e - adding a little milk if required to make it thinner.  Remember, the texture is not going to change much whilst being cooked and will remain at roughly the same consistency as it was when first mixed. 
| Heat the ghee in a frying pan or wok and stir-fry all of the whole spices for half a minute, then add the ginger and garlic and allow them to cook for a minute or so.
| Add the onion and reduce the heat a little and let them cook until translucent; about 5 minutes.
| Add a little more oil or ghee if the mixture looks dry.
| Add the whole crayfish tails, coconut and chillies to the onions, mix well and immediately remove from the heat.
| Add all of the ingredients, apart from the tomatoes, fresh basil and lime juice to a large bowl and mix very well.
| Carefully spread the mixture over the hot baking tray
| Bake for 25 to 35 minutes, adding the tomatoes about half way through and stirring well every 10 minutes.
| The nicest results are when the rice ''just'' crisps and gets a nice chewy, toasted flavour. Be careful though - it spoils if it burns!
| Sprinkle with lime juice and fresh basil leaves and serve immediately.
