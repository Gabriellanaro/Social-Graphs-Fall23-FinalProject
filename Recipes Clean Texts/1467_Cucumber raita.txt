===Description===


A great accompaniment for any Indian recipe.  This will keep in the fridge for a many days and can be made any time of year, even when fresh mint is not available.

Don't add any sugar if the mint sauce is already sweetened.

| Half a cucumber, peeled and chopped into small cubes
| 1 large pot of creamy yogurt
| 2 tablespoons of chopped mint or 4 teaspoon of mint sauce
| 1 teaspoon sugar
| ½ teaspoon table salt

===Method===


| Mix all of the ingredients together
| Chill and serve
