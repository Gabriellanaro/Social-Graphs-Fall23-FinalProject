Very odd idea, but it works very well.

I had not heard of '''cumin rice''' until I started to add recipes to the Mauritian recipe section.  It's quite unusual and very nice.  The cooking method makes for a more creamy textured rice and the cumin flavour is pleasant but not overpowering.

===Ingredients===
| 1 cup of basmati rice
| 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil or ghee
| 1 large onion, peeled and finely chopped
| 2 teaspoons of white cumin seeds
| Boiling water or vegetable stock
| Chopped coriander leaves to garnish


===Mise en place===
* Rinse the rice in a sieve under cold running water, stirring with your hands until the water runs clear. Drain well
===Method===


| Cook the rice in lots of boiling water until the rice is soft on the outside but still has a tiny bite to it.  About 5 minutes
| Remove from the heat and drain in a sieve
| Meanwhile, add the ghee and onions to a large pan and saut\u00e9 until they just turn brown.
| Stir in the cumin seeds.
| Once they start to pop, stir in the rice.
| Add half a cup of boiling water or vegetable stock, cover with a lid, placing a cloth between the pan and the lid being careful not to catch it alight!
| Simmer gently for a further 5 minutes then remove from the heat and let it stand for 7 to 10  minutes so all of the water is absorbed.  Don't stir or mix it at all during this process.
===Serving suggestions===
Serve garnished with chopped coriander leaves
===Variations===
Add a small pinch of black cumin seeds as well as the white cumin seeds.
