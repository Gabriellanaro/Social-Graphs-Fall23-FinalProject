Another great recipe from Nik and Edwina.

This one comes highly recommended: Nik's email telling me about this recipe was entitled \"Possibly the best thing we've ever cooked!\"

===Ingredients===

| 8 small fillets of Lemon Sole 
'''the marinade '''
===Ingredients===NB
| 2 teaspoons salt 
| 2 tablespoons red chilli powder 
| juice of half a lemon 
| 1 tablespoon water 
| 1 teaspoon sugar 
| 2.5cm chunk of ginger, finely chopped 
'''The Pachadi'''
===Ingredients===NB
| 2 tablespoons coconut oil 
| 1 teaspoon mustard seeds 
| 10 curry leaves 
| 1 red onion, finely sliced 
| 1 teaspoon ground turmeric 
| 1 red and 1 green chilli, both slit lengthways and deseeded 
| 1 large tomato, skinned, and cut into eight chunks 
| 1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh coriander leaves 
| 250g Greek yogurt 
| 1 teaspoon salt 
'''the crust '''
===Ingredients===NB
| 10 curry leaves 
| 3 tablespoons dry chickpeas 
| 1 tablespoon yellow split peas 
| \u00bd teaspoon fennel seeds 
| 1 teaspoon black peppercorns 
| 1 dried chilli, finely chopped
===Method===



| Pat the fish fillets dry on kitchen paper. Mix together all the marinade ingredients, and rub them all over the fillets. Set aside for 30 minutes 
| Meanwhile, make the Pachadi. Heat the coconut oil in a heavy bottomed saucepan and add the mustard seeds. When they begin to crackle, add the curry leaves and onion, turn the heat down, and saut\u00e9 gently till the onion is soft and translucent, but not coloured. Add the turmeric, ginger, chillies and tomato, and cook till the tomatoes are just starting to soften. Leave to cool, then add the coriander leaves, yogurt and salt. Stir, then set aside 
| To make the crust, put the curry leaves on a baking tray, and put into a very low oven until they go dry and crisp. Crush them lightly and set aside 
| Into a large heavy based frying pan on a low heat, put the chickpeas, yellow split peas, fennel seeds and peppercorns and gently roast until they start to release their aroma. Put them into a liquidiser, and blitz to a quite fine powder. Allow to cool, then add the chopped dry chilli and crushed curry leaves 
| Dust the fish fillets with the pea and curry leaf powder to form an even coating. You probably won\u0092t need all of the mixture, it keeps in a jar in a cupboard 
| Heat a tablespoon of coconut oil in the frying pan and add the fillets, frying for 1 minute on either side. Place a neat heap of the Pachadi on each of four plates, carefully place 2 fillets on top of each heap, sprinkle with a little chopped coriander and serve
