===Description===

This unusual Spanish Thermomix recipe for Curry sauce is quite rich.

===Ingredients===TM
| 3 eggs yolks
| 250g milk
| Â½ teaspoons curry powder
| Pepper
| Salt
===Method===


| Tip all of the ingredients into the bowl
| Set to '''4 minutes / 80\u00b0 / Speed 4'''
===Serving suggestions===
Serve this sauce with pork, lamb or chicken.  You can also use it to add flavour to a stew, lentils, or a plate of vegetables
===Recipe source===
* This is a translation of a recipe in '''''Thermomix TM31 - Imprescindible para tu cocina''''' which is the book supplied with Spanish TMXs.
===Variations===
[If you like to make your own spice mixes, then add your chosen mix, to taste, instead of the curry powder]
===Chef's notes===
Having made this today, I felt that instead of the salt and pepper, it could have done with a teaspoon of Bron's Spanish vegetable stock concentrate and that the curry powder could have done with being cooked out a bit in some oil or butter, before adding the rest of the ingredients.  I also increased the spice by adding 1 teaspoon jalfrezi masala plus 1 teaspoon of Pakistani basar.

My husband said that this would be excellent with noodles and small pieces of chicken as a type of homemade Pot Noodle.
