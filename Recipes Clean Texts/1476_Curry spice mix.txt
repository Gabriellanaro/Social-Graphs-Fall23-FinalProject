===Description===

[[Image:Spice mix 2.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Spice mix 2]]
These are my favourite two spice mixes for curry.  They are both used, but mix number 1 is added a minute before mix number 2.  I make it in batches and keep in separate jars.
===Ingredients===
=====mix 1=====
===Ingredients===NB
| 6 teaspoons cumin seeds
| 6 teaspoons black mustard seeds
| 6 teaspoons asafoetida
=====mix 2=====
===Ingredients===NB
| 6 teaspoons turmeric
| 6 teaspoons coriander
| 6 teaspoons ground cumin
| 6 teaspoons salt
| 12 teaspoons chilli powder
| 12 teaspoons garlic powder
===Method===

| The first 3 ingredients make up the first spice mix.
| The remaining ingredients make up the second.
| Mix each separately and store in a darkish place until use.
===Serving suggestions===
Can be used in any type of curry.
===Variations===
This will make a medium curry - you can adjust the amount of chilli to your taste.
===Chef's notes===
Mix number 1 should be fried and the other mix should be added with the main ingredient of the curry.  This recipe should make enough for 12 curries for 4 people.  Use about a teaspoon and a half of spice mix 1 to four teaspoons of the second mix.
