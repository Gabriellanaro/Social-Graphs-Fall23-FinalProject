===Description===

A really simple meal that you can put together in no time - if you're lucky you'll probably already have the ingredients.

===Ingredients===
| 454g pack of thick pork sausages
| 850 g potatoes, peeled and diced
| 2 tablespoons gravy granules
| 3 tablespoons Branston pickle
| 1 tablespoon butter
| sea salt and freshly ground black pepper


===Mise en place===
* Preheat the oven to 180\u00b0 C (350\u00b0 F - gas 4)
===Method===


| Boil the diced potatoes for 15 minutes and drain well.
| Grill the sausages until browned all over, about 15 to 20 minutes minutes - cut each sausage into 3 pieces.
| Mix the 2 tablespoons of gravy granules with 400 ml of boiling water and mix well. Stir in the pickle.
| Add the sausages and gravy to an oven proof dish.
| Mash the potatoes with 1 tablespoon of butter, season well and fork over the sausages.
| Bake for 25 minutes then serve.

===Chef's notes===
I can't resist meddling with a recipe, this is no exception.  As I had a few spare spring onions in the fridge, I chopped them up and added them to the mash and the gravy.  I also added a little squash mash to the mash and also sprinkled a little grated cheese over the top.  For 2 greedy people, I made half of the mash quantity but kept the other ingredients the same. 
A very nice recipe!
