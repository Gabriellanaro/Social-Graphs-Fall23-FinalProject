==How to fold samosas==
OK, I know it's a cop-out doing it with paper and popping corn! But I figure that badly done instructions are way better than no instructions at all, so until I get the chance to make and photograph some real samosas, this will have to suffice.

Perfect paper samosas!

Use filo pastry and keep it moist by covering all the sheets with a damp tea-towel. Take each sheet out one at a time to make a samosa.

Mix a little plain flour with a few drops of water into a paste which you can use to seal the final fold.

If you are making these for the first time, find somewhere comfortable where you can sit down while you make them. Put some music on, relax and practice with sheets of paper first!  If, when you are doing it for real, the pastry tears, discard the pastry (or fry on its own and scoff by yourself later) and then start again, otherwise all the contents will just spill out when you deep fry the samosas.

Deep fry in small batches (this prevents the temperature of the oil from falling too much/too quickly) for about 3 or 4 minutes or until they are golden brown. Lift then out with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper. Serve immediately or keep warm in the oven until they are all fried.
