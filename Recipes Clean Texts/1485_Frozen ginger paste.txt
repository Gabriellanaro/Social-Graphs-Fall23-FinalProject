===Description===

This simple mixture of fresh crushed Ginger is the cornerstone of many Indian recipes.

This mixture will keep for 3 days if kept in the fridge, or many months if frozen in useful sized measures.

To freeze, use spoons to measure out separate 'servings' on to a non-stick oven tray, place the tray in the freezer and then bag-up once the Ginger paste has frozen solid.

===Ingredients===

| 300g of unpeeled Ginger
| 3 tablespoons cold water

===Method===

| Cut into thumb-sized pieces
| Blend the Ginger to a paste in a food processor.
