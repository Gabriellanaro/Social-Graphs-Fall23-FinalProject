This simple mixture of fresh crushed garlic is the cornerstone of many Indian recipes.

This mixture will keep for 3 days if kept in the fridge, or many months if frozen in useful sized measures.

To freeze, use a teaspoon to measure out separate 'servings' on to an oven tray, covered with grease-proof paper place the tray in the freezer and then bag-up once the garlic paste has frozen solid. [3 teaspoons equals 1 tablespoon]

===Ingredients===
| 5 heads of garlic, separated into cloves and peeled
| 3 tablespoons cold water
===Method===


| Peel the garlic - this is the easiest way I have found to peel garlic
| Blend the garlic cloves to a paste in a food processor.
