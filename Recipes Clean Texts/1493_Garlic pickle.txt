===Description===

Spicy pickled garlic, probably an acquired taste this one :-)

===Ingredients===
| 14 whole garlic bulbs, topped, tailed and peeled
| 500 ml lemon juice (about 15 lemons)
| 2 tablespoons sea salt
| 100 g (4 oz) dried chilli flakes
| 2 teaspoons fenugreek seeds
| 300 ml sesame oil
===Method===


| Squeeze the juice from the lemons and add to a sterilised 1 litre preserving jar.
| Add the salt and garlic cloves and set to one side for 5 days to pickle.
| After 5 days, heat 2 tablespoons of the sesame oil and fry the chillies and fenugreek seeds.  Ensure the kitchen is very well ventilated or if you can, do this outside!
| Remove from the oil, allow to cool. 
| Add the chilli mixture and remaining oil to a sterilised 1.5 litre (1 x 1 litre and 1 x 500ml ) preserving jar, shake well and seal.
| It should be ready to eat in two weeks.
===Blue garlic===

If your garlic is quite young there may be a chemical reaction with lemon juice and vinegar, which will can cause it to turn bluish-green.  This is nothing to worry about and the garlic is perfectly safe to eat.
