===Description===


I just love homemade dips, sauces and chutneys.  They are usually pretty easy to make and ingredients list can be adjusted to suit your tastes.

I find that the flavour of the vinegar used affects the overall flavour quite drastically and like to test small amounts of different vinegars (and blends of) before I make the main batch.

===Ingredients===
| 225 g (8 oz) jaggery (or brown sugar)
| 900 ml (1.5 pints) vinegar (or vinegar blends of your choice)
| 4 x 10 cm (4\") pieces of ginger, peeled
| 3 cloves garlic, peeled and crushed
| 350 g (12 oz) raisins
| 100 g (4 oz) dried red chillies
| 1 teaspoon fenugreek
| 2 tablespoons sea salt
===Method===


| Make a syrup by boiling the jaggery  in 600 ml (1 pint) of the vinegar
| Dry roast the fenugreek and chillies then grind to a powder in a coffee grinder with the sea salt
| Reserve a quarter of the ginger and a quarter of the raisins.
| Add the remaining ginger and raisins together with the garlic, chillies and fenugreek to a food processor and blend the to a paste
| Cut the quarter of ginger into tiny cubes or slices
| Mix together the syrup, spice paste, remaining vinegar, ginger cubes and remaining raisins
| Place in a large preserving jar and leave for 1 month to mature
