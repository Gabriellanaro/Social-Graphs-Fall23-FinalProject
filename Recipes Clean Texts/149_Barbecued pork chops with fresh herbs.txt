===Description===

Another aide-memoir now we've made such a success of barbecuing these lovely big pork chops from Russell's butchers of Upwell.

We use the instant-light bags of charcoal and find them perfect. They are a little more expensive than pure charcoal but so much less hassle.
===Ingredients===

| Two large pork chops (steaks) from Russell's butchers of Upwell (if you are lucky enough to live nearby!)
| 1 can of Fanta
| 2 tablespoon Taste Sensation Taste Sensation fajita seasoning
| 1 large onion
| A huge handful of fennel leaves
| A huge sprig of sage leaves
===Mise en place===

* Rub the pork steaks with the fajita seasoning
* Place in a Large lock and lock box and pour the tin of Fanta over the meat
* Leave to marinade for 24 hours, turning now and then if you get the chance

===Method===


| Light all four corners of the instant light barbecue coals
| Leave for 25 minutes or until the flames die down and the coals turn white
| Raise a grill on tin cans or containers so the heat is not so intense
| Chop the onions into rings and place on the Le Creuset grill pan
| Lay the fennel and sage leaves to make a bed for the chops
| Drain the chops and place on the herbs so the rind hangs over the edge of the pan (if you like your crackling ðŸ™‚)
| Barbecue for about an hour and a half turning now and then
| BE CAREFULL - If you've not raised the grill tray as I did, you WILL burn the chops!!

===Chef's notes===
