===Description===

Using uncooked poppadums, it is easy to make your own poppadum crisps without any oil at all.  Very healthy.

You can buy uncooked poppadums from supermarkets and any store that sells Indian ingredients; you can also buy them online from Amazon, but check and compare prices, some sellers can charge 10 times as much as other suppliers, so be careful!

These don't stay fresh once cooked so only make as much as you can eat at one time.
===Ingredients===

| 5 uncooked poppadums and scrunch them into crisp-sized pieces
| Search Google for 'uncooked poppadoms' if you can't obtain them easily

===Method===


| Take about 5 raw uncooked poppadums and scrunch them into crisp-sized pieces.
| Place them in a plastic bowl without a lid.
| Microwave on full power for one minute.
| Allow to cool and harden, this will only take a minute or two.
| Eat!

===Serving suggestions===
Take a teaspoon of your favourite Taste Sensation spice mix and stir them into 5 tablespoons of greek yogurt to make a yummy dip for these lovely crisps.

===Chef's note===
* Amazon UK sell [https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B08GGBN41Z/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 Country Range Poppadoms] which I have found to be the nicest and least expensive of their offerings.
