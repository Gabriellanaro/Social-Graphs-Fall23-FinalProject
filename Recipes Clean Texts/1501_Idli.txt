This is a basic recipe for idli which are fermented steamed rice  cakes popularly served for breakfast in Southern India and Sri Lanka

===Ingredients===TM
| 90g idli rice
| 30g urad dall (the hulled, white variety)
| \u00bd teaspoons fenugreek seeds
| Salt to taste
==='''Mise en place'''===

* Rinse and soak the idli rice overnight
* In a separate bowl rinse and soak the urad daal together with the fenugreek seeds overnight
* Do not over-rinse or wash otherwise you will inhibit fermentation. Also use chlorine-free or bottled water if possible

===Method===


| Drain the rice and the daal continuing to keep them separate
| Grind the dal mixture until you have a thick but very smooth paste, adding a little cold water from time to time
| Remove and set aside
| Repeat the process with the rice, adding water as necessary
| Add the daal mixture to the rice and continue to grind until well mixed
| Stir in the salt
| Pour the mixture into a container and leave to ferment overnight
| Stir and check that it has the right consistency
| Grease the idli moulds and fill a steamer base with water
| Bring the water to the boil and divide the mixture between the moulds
| Place in the steamer and cook for 8-12 minutes
| Use a cocktail stick to test for doneness - it should come out clean if the idlis are cooked
| Remove the idlis from the  moulds - they should be light and fluffy
===Serving suggestions===
Serve with sambar, chutneys or dips
