A meaty naan

Nice to be able to add your own meat to a keema, sometimes they can be a bit stingy.

===Description===

Keemah naan, Keema nan or keema naan is an interesting meaty variation on the standard naan bread

===Ingredients===
| 350 g (12 oz) plain flour or wholewheat flour
| 1 teaspoons dried active yeast
| 1 teaspoon of baking powder
| 2 tablespoons of natural yogurt
| 2 teaspoons of vegetable oil
| 2 teaspoons sugar, honey or  or jaggery
| 1 teaspoon sea salt
| 100 g (4 oz) spiced minced beef
===Method===


| Mix the yeast with 2 teaspoons of warm water and the sugar, stir well and leave in a warm place for 10 minutes until it starts to froth
| Add the flour to a large bowl or food processor, tip in the yeast mixture
| Knead for about 15 minutes, adding enough water to make a firm dough
| Cover with a damp tea-towel, leave in a warm place until it rises, this may take up to 3 hours, depending upon temperature
| Add the mince and the salt and knead in well
| Divide into 6 pieces and with floured hands, roll and pat until they are a little larger than saucers
| Cook under a hot grill for about 2 minutes a side, turning once.  Watch it like a hawk as the difference between perfect naan breads and brown biscuits is about 30 seconds!
| These can also be cooked on a hot barbecue, or of course in a tandoor if you are lucky enough
===Using a breadmaker===

If you have a breadmaker, tip all of the ingredients into it, set in to the long (2.5 hour) dough program continue from step 6 above.
