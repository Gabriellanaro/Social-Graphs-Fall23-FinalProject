===Description===

This is another variation of my favourite recipe of all time, Chingri malai roti, a crunchy hot and spicy rice cake that is a one pan main meal.

This time I've used a few fresh tomatoes chopped up and added with the raw king prawns before the roti is crisped under the grill.

Please be very careful if storing cooked rice.  Refrigerate the moment it has cooled and use within 1 day

===Ingredients===
| 200 g (8 oz) uncooked basmati rice.
| 12 large raw king prawns, deveined and each chopped into 3 pieces
| 2 tablespoons ghee or vegetable oil
| 5 fat garlic cloves, peeled and crushed
| 5 cm (2\") ginger, peeled and roughly grated - try making some Frozen ginger paste, it is a good as fresh and lasts for years.
| 75 g (5 oz) onions, peeled and finely chopped
| 1 whole coconut, flesh removed and roughly grated - see Action coconut scraper with vacuum suction base for the easy way to do this.
| 4 hot chilli peppers (red or green), finely chopped - de-seeded if desired
| 2 large tomatoes chopped into small pieces
| 1 tablespoon lime juice
'''spices'''

''don't grind the spices, leave them whole''
* 2 teaspoons whole coriander seeds
* 1 teaspoon whole cumin seeds (white)
* 1/2 a teaspoon of whole fenugreek seeds
* 1 teaspoon turmeric powder

===Method===


| Quickly wash and drain the rice but don't rinse it as you normally would, this dish is best with rice of a starchy consistency. 
| Cook in boiling water for 7 to 11 minutes.
| Rinse the cooked rice in cold water until it is cold.  Drain well.
| Add the rice and coconut to a food processor with a metal blade and blend to a thick creamy consistency - adding a little milk if required to make it thinner.  Remember, the inside is not going to change much whilst being cooked and will remain at roughly the same consistency as it was when first mixed. 
| Heat the ghee in a frying pan or wok and stir-fry all of the spices for half a minute, then add the ginger and garlic and allow them to cook for a minute or so.
| Add the onion and reduce the heat a little and let them cook until translucent; about 5 minutes.
| Add the chilli to the onions, mix well and immediately remove from the heat.
| Preheat the grill.
| Lightly oil a large non-stick oven proof frying pan put on a medium heat.
| Add the rice mixture to the hot pan and ensure the mixture is evenly distributed and patted down.  Distribute the chopped tomatoes evenly throughout the rice and coconut mixture.
| Cook for about 10 minutes or until the rice cake starts to catch on the bottom, then mix it up well so you get lots of crispy bits.
| Mix in the raw king prawns and pat down.
| brown under the hot grill for about 5 minutes just to colour the top surface a little.
| Sprinkle with lime juice and serve immediately.

===Serving suggestions===
This is a perfect meal on its own though it can benefit from a few tablespoons of yogurt as a side dish if the chillies are really hot.  Peas and sweetcorn make a nice colourful accompaniment to this spicy recipe too.
===A better way of cooking this===
After making variants of this for many years, I've discovered the best method of cooking is to spread the ingredients out on a lightly greased baking tray and bake at 220\u00b0 C (425\u00b0 F - gas 7) for 35 minutes, stirring up the contents every 10 minutes.  It might be an idea with a meat other than crayfish, to add the meat (or prawns) for the last 10 minutes so they don't dry out.

===Variations===
Add a splash of nam pla to the chopped prawns and let them marinade for a few hours for a more fishy taste.
