===Description===

A very successful first attempt at barbecuing a spatchcock chicken.

You can easily spatchcock a chicken yourself (How to spatchcock a chicken) but for less than \u00a34.50 Aldi do a prepared spatchcock chicken garlic and herbs or sweet chili]

I made a holder for the chicken from two oven trays held together with garden wire.
===Ingredients===

| One spatchcock chicken
| 3 slices of fatty bacon
| One bag of easy-light barbecue coals
| Optional Habanero chilli sauce

===Method===


| Place the chicken between two grill trays and tie together with garden wire
| This makes repeat turning of the chicken very easy
| Light the barbecue coals and wait until they are white-hot
| Press the foil tray so it's only an inch high
| Lay the fatty bacon strips on the flesh side of the bird to prevent burning
| Place the tray on the coals and the chicken on the tray - this stops the fat burning and holds the chicken away from the direct heat
| Barbecue for 1 hour or until perfectly cooked
| You can check the temperature of the breast meat with a thermometer to see if it's properly cooked [73\u00b0 165\u00b0F]
| Rest for 10 minutes, then serve

===Chef's notes===
One bag of Big K Easy Light Barbecue Coals was enough for this recipe
