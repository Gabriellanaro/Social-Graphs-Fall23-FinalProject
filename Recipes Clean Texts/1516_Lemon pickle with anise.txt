===Description===

Lemon pickle is a traditional condiment used with Indian food. Many pickle recipes from India have oil to help preserve the pickle, but this recipe uses no oil.

===Ingredients===
| 8 unwaxed lemons
| ½ cup of salt
| ¼ cup of sugar
| 4 small green chillies
| 1 tablespoon yellow mustard seed
| 1 tablespoon ground ginger powder
| 1 teaspoon fenugreek seed
| ¼ teaspoon turmeric powder
| 1 to 3 whole star anise pods
===Method===


| Wash the lemons in very hot water and dry thoroughly
| Halve the lemons and remove the pips
| Cut lemons into small pieces, and place in a bowl
| Cover with salt and set aside for at least 24 hours
| Chop the chillies finely.
| Dry-roast the yellow mustard seeds, fenugreek seeds, star anise, and chopped chillies on a high heat, shaking constantly - don't burn them!
| Strain the juice from the lemons into a small saucepan, add the turmeric, ginger and sugar, and simmer for 2-3 minutes until the sugar has dissolved. If there isn't enough juice, add a tablespoon or two of water.
| Add the spices and sugar mixture to the bowl of lemons, and mix together well.
| Pack into a pint jar, pressing the pieces in if needed, to ensure that the liquid covers all the lemon pieces.
| Set aside to mature for 1 month.
