===Description===

Most of the lime pickle recipes I have seen require the limes to be 'cooked' in the sun for up to a month.  With frost still white on the ground in the middle of the afternoon, its going to be a while before I can experiment with that one.

This recipe however can be made even when it's snowing!

===Ingredients===
| 6 unwaxed limes, or more if they are small
| 1 tablespoon sea salt
| 2 teaspoons chili powder
| 1 tablespoon garam masala
| 2 tablespoons jaggery or brown sugar
| 6 cloves of Garlic, peeled and crushed
| 125 ml vegetable oil
| 3 onions, peeled and very finely chopped
| 500 ml malt vinegar
===Method===


| Wash the limes in very hot water, just in case they have been wax-treated
| Halve them and pick out the pips
| Cut into bite-sized pieces, reserving any of the escaping juice
| Put the limes into a lidded Tupperware container
| Mix the chili powder, salt, garam masala, jaggery, garlic and any reserved lime juice together in a small bowl and mix well.  You may need to warm the jaggery a little first.
| Add the mixture to the limes, seal and refrigerate for up to a week if possible.  Shake daily.
| After a week, heat the oil and saut\u00e9 the onions on a low heat until they become translucent, about 10 minutes. Don't brown them
| Add the refrigerated mixture to the pan and cook for about 15 minutes often. Take care not to break up the limes
| Add the vinegar, bring to the boil and immediately reduce the heat, cover and simmer for 1.5 hours
| Remove from the heat, allow to cool and pack into sterilised jars.
| '''Leave in a cool dark place for a month to mature'''
