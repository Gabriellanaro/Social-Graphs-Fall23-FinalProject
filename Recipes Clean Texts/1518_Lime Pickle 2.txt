===Description===


A very delicious, spicy lime pickle to accompany rice dishes
===Ingredients===

| 1.5kg limes, left whole, but stem bits removed
| 300g salt (I used pink Himalayan salt)
| 70g garlic, peeled and finely chopped (50g + 20g)
| 40g ginger, peeled and finely chopped (20g + 20g)
| 150g groundnut oil (or other neutral oil)
| 70g extra hot chilli powder
| 1 teaspoon turmeric
| 2 teaspoons fenugreek, ground
| 1 teaspoon cumin, ground
| 50g black mustard seeds
| 500g water (200g + 300g)
| 100g sugar
| 60g cider vinegar (or white wine vinegar)

===Method===


| Place the limes in a steamer containing water and bring to the boil.
| Steam for 45 minutes.
| Allow the limes to cool then cut each one into 8 pieces.
| Place in a bowl and mix with the salt.
| Cover and leave for 3 days, stirring them twice daily.  No need to refrigerate.
| After this resting time, rinse the limes with water and leave to drain.
| Meanwhile, heat the oil in a pan and fry 50g of the garlic and 20g of the ginger until soft, then set aside.  Don\u0092t let the garlic brown. 
| Using a blender, mix the chilli powder, turmeric, fenugreek, cumin and the remaining 20g each of the garlic and ginger with 200g of the water.  It should end up as a paste.
| Tip the fried garlic and ginger into a bowl, leaving some oil in the pan.
| Re-heat the pan and when hot, add the mustard seeds.
| As soon as the mustard starts to pop, add the spice paste.
| Cook until the oil starts to separate.
| Transfer to a saucepan with the remaining 300g water and simmer, covered, for 40 minutes, stirring frequently.
| Add the sugar and vinegar and continue simmering, covered, for 10 minutes.
| Add the previously cooked garlic and ginger, together with the oil and the limes.
| Mix together (off the heat) until the limes are coated in the spices.
| Put into sterilised jars with vinegar-proof lids and keep for at least one month before eating.
| It is at its best after 6 months to 1 year though.
