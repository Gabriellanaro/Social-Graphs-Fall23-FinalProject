===Description===

Plain boiled or steamed rice is usually fine with a curry, but sometimes it is worth making the effort to create something a little more special.
===Ingredients===

| 30ml groundnut oil
| 1 teaspoon mustard seeds
| Garlic to taste, peeled and sliced
| \u00bd-1 teaspoon dried chilli flakes
| 2 green indian chillies, sliced
| 200g white basmati rice
| \u00bd teaspoon ground turmeric
| 1 teaspoon salt of your choice (omit if using stock)
| 500 ml boiling water or stock
| A few curry leaves
| The juice of 1 lime
| The grated zest of \u00bd lime

===Method===


| Heat the oil in a saucepan over a high heat and add the mustard seeds.
| Cover with a lid and wait for the seeds to start popping.
| Reduce the heat then add the garlic, chilli flakes and green chilli and cook until the garlic is just golden.
| Stir in the rice and cook for a minute or so until the grains are coated in oil and begin to turn transluscent.
| Stir in the turmeric.
| Add the boiling water or stock and cover.
| Reduce the heat and cook for about 15 minutes, until the rice has absorbed the liquid.
| Do not lift the lid during this time.
| Stir in the curry leaves, lime juice and lime zest.
| Cover with a tea towel and leave in the pan for 10 minutes.
| Gently fluff the grains of rice with a fork, and serve.
