===Description===

This is a creamier version of the famous Indian cheese.

===Ingredients===
| 1700 ml full cream cows' milk
| 560 ml single cows' cream
| 70 ml distilled white vinegar


===Mise en place===
* Sterilise all equipment

===Method===


| Heat the milk in a saucepan over a medium heat, stirring from time to time until it is boiling (about 100\u00b0 C (225\u00b0 F).
| Add the vinegar, stir and remove from heat immediately.
| Leave for up to 30 seconds until curds have formed.
| Line a colander with a double layer of boiled cheesecloth and place in the sink or over a large bowl.
| Pour the cheese into the colander and allow to drain until it is cool enough to handle.
| Collect the edges of the cloth and fold them to cover the curds.
| Fill a heavy pan with cold water and place on the top of the cloth.
| Leave until the cheese is firm - this can take from three to five hours.
| Remove the pan and the cloth and wrap in cling-film.
| It will keep in the fridge for up to a week.
===Servings===
Servings: 10 - Makes about 450 g
===Serving suggestions===
The cheese can be crumbled, fried or grilled.
===Variations===
If you are on a low-fat diet, try our more traditional Paneer recipe which does not use cream.

You can make a totally organic version by using organic milk and vinegar, including cider or white vinegar.
===Chef's notes===
If you wish, you can freeze it for up to two months by placing in a self-seal bag and an airtight box such as a Lock&Lock box.
