===Description===

A tasty fruit crumble recipe that goes well with homemade custard.
[[Image:Mango ginger and blueberries.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Mango, ginger and blueberries]]
===Ingredients===
| 100g softened butter, diced, plus a little extra for greasing
| 3 ripe mangoes, peeled and cut into slices
| 180 g raspberries, blueberries, blackcurrants, or fruit of your choice
| Juice and zest of a small tangerine or orange
| 4 teaspoons of brown sugar
| 1 teaspoon freshly grated ginger
| ½ teaspoon ginger powder
| 140 g breadcrumbs
| 100 g cornflakes
| 100 g caster sugar, plus ½ teaspoon for dusting
| 25 g flaked almonds


===Mise en place===
* Preheat the oven to 180\u00b0 C (350\u00b0 F - gas 4), [fan oven 160\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]
===Method===


| Grease a suitable baking dish with butter
| Add the mangoes, brown sugar, juice and zest of the tangerine or orange and 8 tablespoons of water
| Stir and simmer for 5 minutes, remove from the heat and fold in your fruit of choice
| Add the breadcrumbs to a bowl and mix with the cornflakes, scrunching them up as you go.  Add the butter ginger powder and the sugar and knead into the breadcrumbs with your fingers.
| Spoon the crumble over the top of the fruit
| Sprinkle with the flaked almonds and dust with the extra sugar
| Bake for 30 minutes until golden
| As almonds can easily burn, lay a sheet of tin-foil over the crumble if it's getting too brown after 15 minutes
===Serving suggestions===
Serve hot with homemade custard or Greek yogurt.
===Variations===
The original recipe called for rolled porridge oats, but I changed it to cornflakes as I remember my mum making crumble like this, many years ago.  This type of crumble does not hold together as well as a flour-type crumble, but it's all crunch and delicious.
