| 3 tablespoons chilli powder
| 1 tablespoon sea salt
===Method===


| Peel the mangoes with a peeler or mandoline and with a very sharp knife, slice the mangoes
| Blend half of the ginger and half of the redcurrants in a feed processor
| Julienne the remaining ginger
| Add the remaining ingredients apart from the mangoes to a pan and cook for 20 minutes, stirring frequently
| Add the mangoes and simmer gently until the chutney has the consistency of jam and the mangoes are tender
| Allow to cool and store in sterilised, airtight jars jars
