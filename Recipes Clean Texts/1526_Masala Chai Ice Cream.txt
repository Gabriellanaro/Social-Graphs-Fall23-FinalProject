===Description===

You can always expect the unexpected from Nik & Edwina as in this tea Ice cream recipe recently sent to me by Nik.

This is an excellent way to finish a curry, and always reminds us of the chai - Indian tea - served on Indian trains in little clay cups. It\u0092s got a comforting, creamy tea-ish flavour, against a warm, inviting spicey background. We make it with Rooibos tea bags so it is caffeine free but traditionally you\u0092d use a strong tea such as Assam. Chai spice is available from Indian supermarkets throughout London - we get ours in Tooting - but can also be found [http://www.spicesofindia.co.uk/acatalog/Indian-Food-Chai-Garam-Masala.html#aDBE020 online (Spices of India)]

===Ingredients===

| 1 litre half fat milk 
| 50g caster sugar 
| 2 cardamom pods, split
| 6 Assam tea bags or 7 Rooibos tea bags 
| 1 heaped teaspoon chai spice 
| 125ml double cream, whipped until firm but not stiff
===Method===



| Put the milk in a large heavy based saucepan, bring to the boil and simmer for 25 minutes or until reduced to 750ml 
| Add the sugar, tea bags, cardamom, and chai spice. Stir well, return to the heat and boil for a further 15 minutes. This will reduce the mixture to about 500ml. Squeeze the milk out of the tea bags and remove. Allow the mixture to cool
| Once cool, sieve the mixture than whisk in the double cream
| Put into an ice cream maker or freeze
===Serving suggestions===
We serve it with plain or frozen yogurt, and it goes very well with mangoes too
