===Description===

This is based on a recipe in Vineet Bhatia's book '''Rasoi:  New Indian Kitchen''' (ISBN 1906650195).  In his restaurant, he serves it as a canap\u00e9, but I have adapted it to be more substantial and have treated it in two ways.  The first way is to shape it into balls, which are then deep fried and the second is to bake it in a baking tin or casserole dish.  You can do as I did and make half-in-half.

===Ingredients===
| 1 quantity of red onion khichdi
| Plain flour (only if it is to be fried)
| Breadcrumbs, mixed with nigella or black sesame seeds (only if it is to be fried)
| Vegetable oil (only if it is to be fried)
'''For the filling / topping'''
* 120g strong Cheddar cheese
* 120g mozzarella cheese
* 3 tablespoons red onion, finely chopped
* 3 green chillies, finely chopped
* 1 tablespoon fresh ginger, peeled and finely chopped
* 6 tablespoon fresh coriander, chopped
* 2 teaspoons of chaat masala
* Salt

===Method===


| Put the khichdi in a bowl and mash it up a bit using a fork.
| In another bowl, mix the filling / topping ingredients until they stick together.
| If you are baking it, simply use the khichdi as a base in a baking tin or casserole dish and spread the topping mixture over it.
| It can then be baked for around 20 minutes at 190\u00b0 C (375\u00b0 F - gas 5), or until the cheese has melted.
| To make the balls, divide both the khichdi and the filling into 8.
| Take half of each khichdi portion into the palm of your hand and place a whole filling portion in the centre.
| Take the remaining half of the khichdi and place it over the filling.
| Shape into balls, ensuring that the filling is contained within the khichdi.
| Place in the fridge on a baking tray and leave for about 30 minutes until thay have firmed up.
| Put some flour in a bowl and add sufficient water to make a thin batter.
| In another bowl, place the breadcrumb mixture.
| Heat the vegetable oil in a fryer or deep saucepan to 180\u00b0 C.
| Whilst this is heating, coat each ball in the batter and then roll it in the breadcrumbs and seeds until well covered.
| Fry until golden brown and drain on kitchen paper.
| Serve immediately.
