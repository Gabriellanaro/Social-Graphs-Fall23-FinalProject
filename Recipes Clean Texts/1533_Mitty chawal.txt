===Description===


'Dirty' rice with caramelised onions.

===Ingredients===
| 225 g basmati rice
| ½ teaspoon black peppercorns
| 10 green caradmom pods
| 6 cloves
| 2 cinnamon sticks, 7 cm long, broken in half
| 2 tablespoons ghee or rapeseed oil
| 1 large red onion, finely chopped
| 1 teaspoon sugar
| 360 ml cold water
| 1½ teaspoons sea salt
===Method===


| Place the rice in a bowl and cover with cold water.
| Rub the grains of rice through your fingers to wash off any dust.
| Drain the water and repeat the process until the water stays almost clear.
| Drain, and return the rice to the bowl with some fresh water to cover.
| Leave the bowl at room temperature for 30 minutes.
| Meanwhile, coarsely grind the 4 spices in a coffee grinder.
| Heat the ghee or oil in a saucepan over a medium heat.
| Add the onion, sugar and ground spices, and saut\u00e9 until the onion is soft and turns purple brown (about 10-15 minutes).
| Drain the rice and mix into the onions.
| Add the water and the salt and stir once.
| Increase the heat to medium-high and cook until the water has evaporated and craters are beginning to form on the surface.
| Stir once to bring the rice at the bottom of the pan to the surface.
| Cover and immediately reduce the heat to the lowest setting and cook for 8-10 minutes.
| Turn off the heat and allow the pan to stand, on the hob ring for a further 10 minutes.
| Remove the lid, fluff the rice using a fork, and serve.
===Chef's notes===
I think you may need to be very careful to ensure that the rice does not stick to the bottom of the pan!
