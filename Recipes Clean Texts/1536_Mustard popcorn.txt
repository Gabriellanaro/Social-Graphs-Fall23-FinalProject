I like odd flavoured popcorn, that's for certain but not sure about this one!

===Description===

Yet another variation on the popular snack.
[[Image:Popping corn.jpg|300px|thumb|right|75 g of popping corn]] 

I first got the urge to try flavoured popcorn when watching a now, long forgotten cartoon; as mummy dragon was about to go shopping, she warned the two baby dragons not to make garlic popcorn whilst she was gone.  Guess what I did next?

===Ingredients===

| 1 teaspoon dry mustard powder
| 1/2 fresh thyme, chopped finely
| Â½ teaspoon sea salt
| Pinch of chili powder
| Good twist of freshly ground black pepper
===Method===


| Put the popcorn in a large bowl
| Sprinkle with the remaining ingredients
| Mix well
===Serving suggestions===

Serve warm
