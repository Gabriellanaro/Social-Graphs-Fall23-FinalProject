But definitely worth it.  So nice to know you've made these yourself.
 

The Judge 

A popular first course in British Indian restaurants, but which can also be served as a snack or accompaniment.  This method makes use of a deep fat fryer.

===Ingredients===
| 225 g (chickpea) flour
| 2 level teaspoons salt
| 1 teaspoon garam masala
| 1 teaspoon coriander leaves, finely chopped
| 2 tablespoons mint sauce
| 130 - 150 ml water
| 4 medium onions, finely sliced
| Peanut oil
===Method===


| Sieve the dry ingredients and mix in the coriander leaves and mint sauce.
| Add the water and mix in to make a stiff paste; err on the dry side if necessary.
| Stir in the onions and allow to rest for an hour or so.
| Heat the oil to 180 C and drop two or three tablespoons of the mixture into the basket.  Make sure that the bhajees are not touching each other.
| Fry for two minutes, remove from pan and place on a large plate which has been covered with kitchen roll; they will not be cooked at this stage.
| Switch off the fryer.
| Once the mixture has been used and the bhajees have cooled slightly, shape them into balls.
| Place them on shallow baking trays, lined with greaseproof paper or Bake-O-Glide and refrigerate for 30 minutes or until you are ready to re-fry them.
| Reheat the oil and fry the bhajees for a further two to three minutes until brown.
| Serve immediately.
===Serving suggestions===
Serve with Yoghurt mint sauce.
===Variations===
For a shallow fried, spicier version, see Chef's recipe.
===Chef's notes===
The amount of water needed is a case of trial and error.  If too wet, the mixture will stick to the frying basket, which will need to be washed if it does, before frying the next batch.

Should you wish to keep the oil for future use, drain into a saucepan or bowl with the aid of a colander lined with butter muslin.  Pour into airtight containers (such as Lock&Lock jugs) and keep in the fridge.
