[[Image:Orange biter (chili sauce) recipe.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Simmering chillies]]
Another one of my chili sauce creations!

It made more sense to measure the chillies by volume rather than weight.  The chili flakes I have are slightly oily and would be heavier than truly dried chillies.

Wear rubber gloves and work in a well ventilated kitchen when handling this amount of chillies.

===Ingredients===
| 250 ml malt vinegar
| 350 ml red wine vinegar
| 250 ml juice from preserved lemons (basically very salty lemon juice)
| 200 ml water
| 100 g jaggery
| 2 pints (by volume) of Turkish chilli flakes
| 2 oranges
===Method===


| Add everything but the oranges to a large pot and bring to the boil
| Reduce the heat and simmer for 15 minutes, stirring often
| Meanwhile, halve the oranges and extract the juice
| Stir the chilli mix to ensure the jaggery has dissolved
| Mix in the orange juice and add the orange skins (they will be removed and discarded later)
| Simmer the mixture for another 5 minutes
| Remove from the heat and leave for 4 hours
| Remove and discard the orange skins, being careful not to waste too much sauce
| Add the mixture to a food processor with a sharp blade and reduce to a puree
| Decant into sterilised jars and store in a dark place for 3 months
===Chef's tip===
This is very good - though it never got its 3 months rest!  Only 1 jar left now.
===Third batch===
See comments page for details of the even more successful 3rd batch
