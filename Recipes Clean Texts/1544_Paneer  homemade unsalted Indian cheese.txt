===Description===


Paneer (Hindi: पनीर panīr; Urdu: پنير from Persian: پنير panir) is a fresh cheese common in South Asian cuisine. It is of Indian origin often referred in the Vedas dating back to 6000 BC. In eastern parts of India, it is generally called Chhena. It is an unaged, acid-set, non-melting farmer cheese or curd cheese made by curdling heated milk with lemon juice, vinegar, or any other food acids.

===Ingredients===

| 1.2 litres (2 pints) full cream milk
| 1 lemon
| Ghee


===Mise en place===

* Sterilise all equipment
===Method===



| Boil the milk, twice, leaving it to cool for 10 minutes in between boils, stirring well to prevent burning.
| Squeeze in lemon juice to split the milk.
| Cover a separate pan with a muslin cloth or a clean tea-towel and pour the milk through it to separate the curds and whey.
| Reserve the whey, as it's useful to cook rice in.
| Hang the curds in the cloth for a whole day to allow the remaining whey to drip out.
| After this time, place the curds in the cloth under a weight to flatten into a cake.
===Serving suggestions===
The paneer can also be cut into cubes and fried in hot ghee until coloured a little.
