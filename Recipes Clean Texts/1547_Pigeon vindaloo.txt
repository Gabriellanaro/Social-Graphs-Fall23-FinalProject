===Description===


Pigeon is a meat that you are unlikely to find in the shops, you need to know someone who shoots for this. However, if you do, here is the recipe.

I guess you could use a chicken for this, but you won't get the wonderful livery flavour of pigeon

===Ingredients===
| 4 whole pigeons, plucked and gutted and cleaned
| 2 onions
| 3 tablespoons ghee
| Sea salt to taste

'''Spice mixture'''
* 12 dry chillies
* 1 teaspoon cumin seeds
* ½ teaspoon black mustard seeds
* 2.5 cm (1\") ginger, peeled and grated
* 1 teaspoon turmeric powder
* 1 teaspoon fenugreek seeds, powdered
* 6 cloves of garlic, peeled and crushed
* 1 to 2 tablespoons malt vinegar, sherry vinegar or red wine vinegar

===Method===


| In a coffee grinder or food processor, blend all the spice mixture ingredients to a fine paste
| Quarter the pigeons
| Peel and slice the onions
| In a wok, fry the onions in the ghee until softened, about 4 minutes
| Add the spice paste and sizzle for 5 minutes, stirring well
| Add the pigeons and add just enough water to cover them
| Simmer slowly until the pigeon is cooked and tender
===Serving suggestions===

I like to serve this curry with plain boiled potatoes (or even chips!) and a Mint riata.
