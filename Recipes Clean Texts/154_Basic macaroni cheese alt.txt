===Description===

This Mac and cheese recipe is a variation on the Basic macaroni cheese recipe as suggested by Alastair Meikle.

The difference is in the method; the ingredients are the same.

We have some more elaborate macaroni cheese recipes here.  This is a simple version.  You could make it even simpler by omitting the parmesan cheese without spoiling the overall effect.
 
Of course you can substitute your favourite cheese in place of the cheddar.

===Ingredients===
| 250g (9oz) macaroni pasta
| 40g (1½ oz) butter
| 40g (1½ oz) plain flour
| 600ml (1pint) milk
| 250g (9oz) grated cheddar cheese
| 50g (2oz) freshly grated parmesan cheese
| Additional flavouring: Add tomato ketchup to taste


===Mise en place===
* Preheat the Oven - 190\u00b0C (375\u00b0F, Gas Mk.5).
===Method===


| Cook the macaroni in a large saucepan of lightly-salted boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes or until al-dente.
| Meanwhile make a roux by melting the butter over a gentle heat in another saucepan that will be large enough to hold the pasta and the sauce together.
| Add the flour and mix well with a wooden spoon.
| Cook this roux for a minute.
| Add the milk, salt, pepper and cheese and keep stirring until the flour 'explodes'.
| Drain the macaroni and pour it into the cheese sauce, stir well.
| Serve. 
'''alternatively'''
# Tip the mixture into an oven proof dish
# Sprinkle grated cheese on top and bake until the cheese topping is crisp and brown.
