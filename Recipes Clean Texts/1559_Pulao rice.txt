Don't skimp on the spices, they make all the difference between the poor quality 'coloured' rice offered by some take-aways and the real thing.

===Description===

'''Pilaf''', also called '''polao''', '''pilau''' or '''pulao''', is a dish in which a grain, such as rice or cracked wheat, is browned in oil, and then cooked in a seasoned stock. Depending on the local cuisine it may also contain a variety of meat and vegetables. Pilaf and similar dishes are common to Middle Eastern, Central, South Asian, Latin American and Caribbean cuisine.

| 1 oz seedless sultanas
| 2 medium onions, chopped (1 for garnish, 1 for the rice)

| Add dry spices and fry for 2 minutes
| Add the rice and coat with the oil and spices
| Sprinkle the crumbled stock cube over the rice mixture
