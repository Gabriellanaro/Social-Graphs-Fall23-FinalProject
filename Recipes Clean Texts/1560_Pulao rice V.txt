===Description===

'''Pilaf''', also called '''polao''', '''pilau''' or '''pulao''', is a dish in which a grain, such as rice or cracked wheat, is browned in oil, and then cooked in a seasoned stock. Depending on the local cuisine it may also contain a variety of vegetables. Pilaf and similar dishes are common to Middle Eastern, Central, South Asian, Latin American and Caribbean cuisine.

This version of pulao rice is a bit of a fiddle but worth making it if you have the time.

| 4 cups boiling water
| Â½ teaspoon turmeric powder
| pinch of saffron strands
| 1 oz flaked almonds
| 1 oz seedless sultanas
| 2 medium onions, chopped (1 for garnish, 1 for the rice)

| remove half of the onions and reserve, leaving most of the oil in the pan

| Remove from heat and leave undisturbed for a further 10 minutes.
