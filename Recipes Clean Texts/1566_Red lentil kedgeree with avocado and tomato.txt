===Description===

A vegetarian slant on the popular Indian breakfast dish that is perfect for a light supper or snack.

This recipe  does '''not''' need preparing in advance, but as supermarkets seem unable to sell ripe avocados at a reasonable price, if at all, it might be worth buying unripe avocados, leaving them on a window sill until nice and soft and making this recipe when they are just right.

===Ingredients===
| 150 g basmati rice
| 150 g red lentils
| 15 g ghee or butter
| 1 tablespoon olive oil
| 1 onion, peeled and sliced
| 2 cloves of garlic, peeled and crushed
| 2 tablespoons korma, Madras or vindaloo curry paste
| 1 bay leaf
| 450 ml vegetable stock
| 1 tablespoon lemon juice
| 1 ripe avocado
| 4 tomatoes, peeled
| 2 tablespoons chopped fresh coriander
| sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
| 1 lime, sliced to garnish
| Chopped spring onions (optional)
| Thinly sliced raw onions (optional)
===Method===


| Soak the rice and lentils in cold water for 10 minutes, drain well.
| Heat the oil and butter in a large pan and sautee the onion gently for 5 minutes
| Add the crushed garlic and the korma paste and stir-fry for a few minutes
| Tip in the rice and lentils and bay leaf, stir to coat with oil.
| Add the stock, stir once and bring to the boil.
| Simmer, covered for 15 minutes - check that the lentils and rice are properly cooked.  If they are not cooked after 15 minutes, sprinkle a little more water over them if they are drying out and give them another 5 minutes. Some lentils take longer than others.
| Peel and dice the avocado and toss in the lemon juice, chop the tomatoes and coriander and mix in with the avocados.
| Season with salt and pepper.
| Serve the rice and red lentils, topped with the tomatoes, avocados and herbs.
===Serving suggestions===
Serve garnished with lime slices.

After making this a few times we discovered that raw onions with a splash of lemon juice made a contrasting and refreshing garnish.
===Variations===
A few nuts or toasted almonds would be nice added at the last minute.

Add 3 or 4 cloves of peeled and crushed garlic with the onions.
===Chef's notes===
The prepared Indian curry pastes are a cheat, but a great stand-by for recipes like this.  If you have your own fresh spices they you will know what to use to make an equivalent fresh spice mix.
