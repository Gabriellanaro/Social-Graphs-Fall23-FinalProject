Roti is the traditional Indian bread, normally eaten with curries or cooked vegetables. It is made most often from wheat flour, cooked on a flat or slightly concave iron griddle called a tawa. It is similar to a tortilla in appearance. Like breads around the world, roti is a staple accompaniment to other foods, maybe spread with ghee (clarified butter) or yogurt.

Whilst kneading dough can be therapeutic, if time is your enemy, then the food processor is your friend.

Roti are the perfect accompaniment to most Indian dishes.

===Ingredients===
| 1 cup atta flour or strong white flour
| 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
| Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
| 2 tablespoons yogurt (optional)
| Â½ cup water
===Method===


| Tip all of the ingredients and half of the water into the food processor with a plastic blade or dough hook attachment
| Blitz the mixture whilst adding a more water a little at a time until you have a soft, pliable dough that is not too sticky
| Remove from the processor, dust with a little flour and rest for 30 minutes in a bowl, covered with a damp tea-towel
| Divide into 6 equal parts and roll into balls
| With a rolling pin on a floured surface, roll each roti out into a 13cm (5\") disc, about the thickness of a small coin (penny, dime, nickel etc)
| Without using any oil, heat a tava or frying pan until very hot
| Cook each roti for about 2 minutes a side until flecked with brown patches. They should puff up slightly.
===Serving suggestions===
Keep warm whilst the remaining rotis are are cooked.
