My favourite pitta dip

This is great to dip flatbreads in.  I prefer home-made pittas with this.  Leave some of the spices whole, it makes it taste truly authentic.

[[Image:Sambar dhal ingredients.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Sambar dhal, the ingredients]]

Sambar dhal (sambar dal), (sanber daal is a lentil stew or chowder. It is very popular in the cooking of southern regions of India especially in Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh.

A nice vegetarian accompaniment or even a main dish if served with pillau rice and poppadoms or nan breads.

===Ingredients===
| 250 g (8 oz) red lentils
| 850 ml (1.5 pints) water or vegetable stock
| 1 teaspoon turmeric powder
| 4 green chillies, sliced lengthways
| 1 tablespoon chopped coriander leaves
| 250 g (8 oz) aubergine, cut into strips
| 240 g (8 oz) can of peeled tomatoes
| 2 tablespoons vegetable oil or ghee
| 2 onions, peeled and chopped
| 4 Cloves of garlic, peeled and crushed (or to taste)
| 2 cm (1 \") ginger root, peeled and grated - Try homemade lazy ginger instead.
| 1 teaspoon coriander seeds ground to a powder
| 1 teaspoon white cumin seeds
| ½ teaspoon fenugreek seeds
| ½ teaspoon black mustard seeds
| ½ teaspoon salt
| 1 scant teaspoon jaggery or sugar
===Method===


| Rinse the lentils, place in a large pan, cover with cold water and bring to the boil, then simmer for 10 minutes.
| Add the turmeric, chillies, coriander leaves and turmeric powder, aubergines and tomatoes and juice, salt & sugar.  Cover and simmer for 30 minutes or until the lentils are very soft.
| Heat the oil in a small pan. Saut\u00e9 the onions and garlic for 4 minutes or until soft and golden.
| Add the ginger, cumin, fenugreek and mustard seeds and fry for 2 minutes.
| Stir the onion mix into the lentils and serve.
===Chef's notes===
I like to powder half of the spices and very roughly grind the remaining half to get a coarse spice mix that holds little taste-bursts when you get them.
