===Ingredients===
| 600ml vegetable oil
| 900g peanuts or cashew nuts
| 1 teaspoon salt
| 4 teaspoons chilli powder
| 4 teaspoons garlic powder
| 2 teaspoons of ground black pepper
===Method===


| Heat the oil in a deep pan to a high temperature.
| Add the nuts in batches and fry until golden - about 10-15 seconds.
| Drain each batch on kitchen paper.
| Mix the remaining ingredients thoroughly in a large bowl.
| Add the peanuts or cashew nuts to the bowl and ensure that all of the nuts are coated with the spice mixture.
| Allow to cool and transfer to an airtight container.
===Serving suggestions===
These are usually served as a party snack so would go well with a glass of wine or a nice cup of tea.
===Chef's notes===
Peanuts will keep for up to 3 weeks and cashew nuts up to 2 weeks.
