Lovely, but don't overcook the fish steaks or they will be as dry as cardboard.

===Description===

This is a really tasty great summer barbecue recipe idea that can just as easily be cooked on the oven grill or griddle.

Don't forget to rest the fish for 7 minutes, it makes a massive difference.

===Ingredients===
| 4 x 200g (7 oz) swordfish steaks
| 1 teaspoon coriander seeds
| 2 teaspoons paprika powder
| 1 teaspoon ground ginger
| 1 teaspoon chili powder
| ½ teaspoon allspice
| 1 level teaspoons peppercorns (white preferred, black will do)
| 1 teaspoon sea salt
| 1.5 teaspoons olive oil


===Mise en place===
* Grind the whole spices in a coffee grinder or pestle and mortar 
===Method===


| Mix the spices and oil together to form a smooth paste
| Spread over both sides of the fish
| Leave to marinade for 1 hour in a cool place
| Cook for 4 minutes a side on a hot barbecue
| Remove, cover and rest for 7 minutes

===Variations===
* Add a whole 'clove' of star-anise (8 petals) to the grinder and a really good splash of lemon or lime juice.  If you cannot find swordfish, marlin makes a good substitute.
===Serving suggestions===
Serve hot with fennel relish and a mixed bean salad
