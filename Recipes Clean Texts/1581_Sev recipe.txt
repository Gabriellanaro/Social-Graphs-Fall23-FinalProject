===Description===

Robin has kindly given me permission to use this recipe and picture that appeared on her [http://www.flickr.com/photos/fotoosvanrobin/ Flickr feed] recently.

===Ingredients===
| 1 cup gram flour (besan/chickpea flour)
| 1/2 cup rice flour
| 1 teaspoon salt
| 1/2 a teaspoon cayenne pepper
| 1/2 a teaspoon turmeric powder
| 1/4 of a teaspoon baking powder
| 1 teaspoon ground cumin seeds
| 1 teaspoon ground coriander seeds
| 2 teaspoons of lime juice
| Oil for deep-frying
===Method===


| Make a thick batter by mixing the ingredients with a little less than 1/2 cup of water.
| Use a sev-press above the pan to make the spaghetti-like thingies so that they fall directly into the heated oil below.
| Deep-fry for 2-3 minutes in oil at 160\u00b0C (325\u00b0F)
