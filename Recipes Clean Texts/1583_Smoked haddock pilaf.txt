===Ingredients===

| 40g groundnut oil
| 1 scotch bonnet chilli, chopped
| Garlic, to taste, chopped
| 1 small piece fresh ginger, peeled and finely chopped
| 2 teaspoons Pakistani basar
| 250g basmati rice
| 1 bay leaf
| Salt and freshly ground black pepper
| 375ml fish stock
| 400g un-dyed smoked haddock fillet, boned, skin on, cut into 4 equal portions
| 2 free-range eggs, hard-boiled, peeled, grated
| 2 spring onions, trimmed, finely sliced
| Fresh coriander, to taste, chopped


===Mise en place===

* Preheat the oven to 200\u00b0 C (400\u00b0 F - gas 6), [fan oven 180\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]
===Method===



| Heat the oil in a large, heavy-based saucepan.
| Add the chilli, garlic and ginger and saut\u00e9 for a minute or two. 
| Add the Pakistani basar and cook for a further few seconds, stirring constantly.
| Add the rice and stir until it is well coated with the oil.
| Add the bay leaf, and the seasoning. 
| Pour over the stock, bring to a simmer, and remove from the heat.
| Tip the rice mixture into a casserole dish.
| Arrange the fish on the top, pushing it slightly under the surface.
| Cover and cook for 20-25 minutes.
| Remove from the oven, then leave to stand for 5-7 minutes without removing the lid.
| Take off the lid, remove the skin from the fish and immediately add the grated egg, spring  onions and coriander.
| Using two forks, gently mix the rice, while also breaking the fish into flakes and mixing everything else in as you go. 
| Remove the bay leaf and cover with a tea towel, and the lid. 
| Leave for a further 5 minutes to remove any excess steam. 
| Mix again lightly and serve directly from the dish onto hot plates.
===Serving suggestions===
