That's a new one on me - better than frying though

===Description===


This is a recipe that I have adapted from Pat Chapman's \"Kinga Nishat\" recipe - ''Skewered spicy batter prawns''.

Basa is an excellent firm and flavoursome fish that is also sustainable.  It is a good substitute for prawns.

When I made this with masa harina it did not stick well to the fish, however it was really tasty so it will be made again, with the proper ingredients next time.

===Ingredients===
| 2 packs basa fillets (about 650 g)
| 4 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice
| 1 tablespoon freshly Crushed garlic
| 1 tablespoon freshly grated root ginger
| 2 eggs - beaten
| 4 tablespoons single cream
| 2 tablespoons gram flour
| 1 teaspoon lovage seeds
| ½ teaspoon turmeric
| ½ teaspoon fine sea salt
===Method===


| Cut the basa fillets into skewerable chunks - you may need to fold the basa as you skewer it if it's very thin.
| Add the basa, garlic, ginger and lemon juice to a lock and lock box, close, shake well and refrigerate for 30 minutes or so to marinade.
| Whisk the egg in another bowl and add the remaining ingredients.  The consistency should be like double cream. Adjust by adding more flour or cream.
| Pour the egg mixture into the Lock and Lock box, close and shake like mad.
| Refrigerate for a further 15 minutes.
| Skewer the basa and barbecue for 10 to 15 minutes or alternatively, shallow fry in ghee or butter and skewer before serving.
===Variations===
Try this with large king prawns, scampi or crayfish.
===Chef's notes===
When I came to make this i discovered that I had run out of gram flour.  I made it with masa harina and a little plain flour to get to the consistency of double cream.
Plain flour or self raising flour would be just as good if you did not have gram flour
