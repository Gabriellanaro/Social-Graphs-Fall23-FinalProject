===Description===


This is a simple recipe for a basic tomato soup as commonly eaten in the first half of the 20th century.
===Ingredients===

| 25g butter, dripping or lard
| 1 Spanish onion, peeled and coarsely diced
| 1 medium carrot, scraped and diced
| 2-3 stalks celery, diced (include leaves if available)
| 60g streaky bacon, diced
| A pinch of sugar or more (optional but will help to caramelise the vegetables and reduce acidity)
| 1 bay leaf
| 1 sprig of thyme
| 1 sprig of parsley
| 2 tins whole tomatoes (see Chef's notes below)
| 900mls Chicken, ham or vegetable stock 
| 2 teaspoons cornflour

===Method===


| Melt the butter, dripping or lard in a heavy bottomed pan over a low heat.
| Add the vegetables and bacon and saute until the onions are slightly softened.
| Stir in the sugar and cook until the vegetables are beginning to caramelise.
| Let it take as long as it needs to do this.
| Add the herbs, tomatoes and stock and simmer, covered, for about 1-2 hours
| Remove and discard the herbs, rub the soup through a fine sieve and return to the pan.
| Take a little of the stock and mix with the cornflour.
| Return to the pan and bring to a gentle boil.
| Cook for a few minutes and season to taste.
| Garnish with croutons or a little chopped parsley.
===Serving suggestions===
Serve with white bread rolls

===Variations===
If you have a good blender, then you can blend the soup after removing the herbs, rather than passing through a sieve.
You can used milk to replace some of the stock, in which case do not add it until you have brought the soup to a boil after mixing in the cornflour.  Re-heat by simmering only.
===Chef's notes===
You can use fresh tomatoes instead of tinned, providing they are tasty and ripe.  The flavourless, under-ripened ones commonly sold in British supermarkets are not suitable.  For my personal taste, I think a teaspoon of sugar is needed, but does depend on the acidity of your tomatoes.
