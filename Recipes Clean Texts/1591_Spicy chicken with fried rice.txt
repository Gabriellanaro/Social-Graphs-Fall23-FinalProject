This is basically a very quick way to make tandoori chicken at home. There is a more elaborate version here if you want one but do try this first, you will be surprised how good it is.

'''Tandoori-style chicken'''
===Ingredients===
| 6 chicken thighs, skin on
| 200g Greek yogurt
| 2 teaspoons grated ginger or lazy ginger
| 2 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed
| 1 teaspoon turmeric
| 1 teaspoon chilli powder
| Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
'''Simple fried rice'''
===Ingredients===NB
| 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
| 1 onion, peeled and finely chopped
| 200g rice, cooked and drained
| 2 tablespoons frozen peas, defrosted (or vegetables of your choice)

===Mise en place===
'''Marinate the chicken'''
* Add the yogurt, ginger, garlic, spices and seasoning to a large bowl and mix well.
* Cut 3 or 4 slits across each thigh, penetrating the flesh.
* Add the chicken pieces and coat well. Cover (with foil or clingfilm) and refrigerate for 30 minutes or longer.
* Preheat the oven to 190\u00b0 C (375\u00b0 F - gas 5)
===Method===


| Line a grill rack with foil and bake for 30 to 35 minutes until golden brown and cooked through.
''For the 'Fried rice'''

| Heat the oil and fry the onion for 4 minutes
| Add the rice and peas then stir fry for 3 to 4 minutes until the rice is properly reheated.
| Serve immediately.
===Variations===
The chicken pieces could be cooked on a barbecue just as easily. Turn them often.
