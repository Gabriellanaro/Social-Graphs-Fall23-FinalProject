===Description===

This dish is sympathetically cooked in spices and yogurt in a similar manner to chicken tikka.  It is particularly suitable for firm white fish.

Note: a part of this recipe ideally needs to be prepared the day before (although 1 hour marinating is adequate if you are pushed for time)

===Ingredients===
| 675g (1.5 lb) firm white fish; (basa, hoki, cod, halibut, bream, bass) - bones removed and cut into bite-sized chunks
| 2 medium onions, peeled, one finely chopped, one sliced
| 3 cloves of garlic, peeled and crushed
| 2.5 cm (1\") peeled root ginger, grated
| 2 teaspoons turmeric powder
| 3 dried red chillies (reduce amount if necessary to your taste) - crushed
| 500 ml (1 large pot) plain natural yogurt - the acidic type, not Greek-style
| 1 teaspoon coriander seeds, ground in a coffee grinder
| Good pinch of salt
| 2 tablespoons ghee
| 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
'''To garnish'''
* Freshly chopped coriander, parsley or basil leaves

===Method===


| In a pestle and mortar, pound the finely chopped onion, garlic, ginger, chillies, salt and spices so you have a smooth paste.
| Add the spice mix to a large bowl, add the yogurt and mix well to combine.
| Add the fish to this mixture and coat well.  Refrigerate for at least 1 hour so the flavours infuse.  Marinate overnight if possible.
| Heat the oil and ghee in a wok and gently fry the chopped onions until just coloured - about 5 minutes.
| Reduce the heat, add the fish and all of the marinade and cook on a gentle heat for 15 minutes.
