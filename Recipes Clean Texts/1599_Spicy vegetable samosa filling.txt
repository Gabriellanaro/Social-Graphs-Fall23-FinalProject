===Description===

This is basically the filling for vegetable samosas, however it could easily be served as a main course with pilau rice and naan breads

Because it is meant to be a samosa filling it should be quite dry or you will have a shock when you deep fry them!  If you are serving this as a main course it does not have to be as dry.

===Ingredients===
| 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
| 1 onion, peeled and finely chopped
| 2 cloves garlic, crushed
| 3 medium potatoes, peeled and cut into small cubes
| ½ cup frozen peas, defrosted
| ½ cup finely sliced cabbage
| 2 tablespoons desiccated coconut (you can prepare this yourself if you wish)
| 1 green chilli, de-seeded and sliced into rings
| ½ teaspoon garam masala
| ½ teaspoon chilli powder
| ½ teaspoon turmeric powder
| 2.5 cm (1 \") peeled ginger root, grated
| 1 teaspoon ground coriander seeds
| ½ teaspoon ground cumin
| ½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
| Juice of half a lemon
| A big handful of chopped coriander leaves
| Sea salt to taste
===Method===


| Boil the potatoes, peel and roughly mash them
| Cook the peas by boiling or microwaving 
| Cook the cabbage by boiling or microwaving so it's to your liking
| Fry the onions in the oil until slightly brown
| Add all of the spices apart from the coriander and stir-fry for 3 minutes
| Add the mashed potatoes, peas and cabbage and stir-fry for a little longer, mixing well
| Add all of the spices apart from the coriander leaves, stir well and fry for a minute
| Add the lemon juice and coriander leaves
===Serving suggestions===
