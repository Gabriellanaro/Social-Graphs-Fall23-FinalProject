===Description===

'''Also known as B\u00e9chamel sauce'''

This is your starting point for many sauces.

===Ingredients===
| 1 tablespoon butter
| 1 tablespoon sifted plain flour
| ½ pint (300 ml) cold milk or half milk, half stock
===Method===


| Gently melt the butter in a pan.  Don't burn it
| Add all of the sifted flour
| Mix the flour and butter until it becomes a paste
| Turn to a medium heat and gradually add all the milk, whisking constantly
| Ensure none of the sauce is stuck to the bottom of the pan
| Whisk gently until the sauce starts to bubble
| Reduce to a very low heat and cook for 5 minutes
===Chef's tip===

The key to a perfect sauce is to keep whisking until all of the milk has been added and there are no lumps

===Variations===

This white sauce is used as a base for many different sauces, including:
* Mornay sauce (cheese)
* Nantua sauce (shrimp, butter and cream)
* Cr\u00e8me sauce (double cream)
* Mustard sauce (prepared mustard)
* Soubise sauce (finely diced onions that have been sweated in butter)
* Cheese sauce (cheddar cheese, mustard powder, Worcestershire sauce)
