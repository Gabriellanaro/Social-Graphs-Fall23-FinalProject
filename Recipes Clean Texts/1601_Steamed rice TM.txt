===Description===


Perfect rice is easily made in a Thermomix.

===Ingredients===TM
| 1 kg water
| 300g basmati rice
| 1 teaspoon sea salt
===Method===


| Weigh the water into the bowl.
| Weigh the rice into the internal steaming basket and sprinkle in the salt.
| '''5 seconds / Speed 5'''.
| '''20 minutes / Temp. Varoma / Speed 2Â½ / MC open end up'''.
| Increase to '''Speed 4''' if it bubbles up onto the lid.
===Variations===
For a bit of extra flavour, use stock instead of water and omit the salt.  
===Chef's notes===
Any water left over can be used to make stock.  If you are cooking 150g rice or less, use only 800g water.  Do not exceed 400g of rice at one time.
