And not at all greasy, like the ones you get from the Indian take-away. \ud83d\udc73

Another easy to make Indian flatbread.  This vegetarian dish is made with a potato (Aloo) stuffing.

I made these with strong wholemeal flour as I had run out of durum atta.  I think they are nice this way.

===Ingredients===
| 1 portion aloo stuffing for parathas 
| 1 Cup [http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=Golden+Temple+flour Golden Temple Flour] (duram atta) - Strong flour can be used as a substitute.
| 1/3 \u2014 ½ cup water
| ½ teaspoon Salt
| 2-3 teaspoons ghee, butter or vegetable oil
===Method===


| Starting with 1/3 cup of water, add all of the ingredients in a bowl (or a food processor)
| Knead or blitz the mixture into a smooth elastic dough adding more water if required.  This will take about 5 minutes if hand-kneading
| Diving in eight equal sized balls
| Lightly oil a Tupperware-type container add the balls, cover and leave to rest for at room temperature for at least 30 minutes, ideally a few hours.
| Roll out the dough so it's just large enough to cover the potato ball
| Wrap the potato with the dough
| Flour the wrapped dough ball and place the ''messy'' side down
| Roll out to a 6\" circle (I forgot to photo this, I was too busy eating the results!)
| Don't worry too much if the potato comes through the dough.  It won't puff up all cheffy, but it'll taste just as good.
| Place the paratha in a very hot frying pan or tava 
| Heat for a minute then flip over for another minute.  I then splash a little oil in the pan and cook for another 2 minutes per side.  You can see when they are done. You can oil the paratha rather than the pan.  I just find it easier this way.
| (I like to use olive oil as I feel it's healthier, even if it's not authentic)
