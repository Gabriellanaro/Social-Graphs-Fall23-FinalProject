This tandoori chicken recipe is reproduced, courtesy of British Onions.

===Ingredients===
| 1 Medium white onion, finely chopped
| 2-3 Garlic cloves, finely chopped
| 2.5cm/1inch Piece root ginger, peeled, grated
| 1 Fresh red chilli, deseeded, finely chopped
| 1 Teaspoon ground cumin
| 1 Teaspoon ground coriander
| 1 Teaspoon garam masala
| 1 Teaspoon paprika
| Half teaspoon turmeric
| 200g/7oz Natural yogurt
| Juice half a lemon
| Salt and ground black pepper
| 4 Chicken breasts, each about 150g/5oz
| 4 Small red onions, cut into wedges
'''To garnish'''
* Lime wedges

===Method===


| Put the chopped onion and garlic into a glass or china bowl, add the ginger and chilli, then the dried spices, yogurt and lemon. 
| Add salt and pepper and mix together. 
| Stir in the cubed chicken and chill in the fridge for 3 hours or overnight if preferred.
| When ready to serve thread the chicken on to metal skewers or soaked wooden skewers with the onion wedges.
| Put on to a lightly oiled grill rack, drizzle with a little extra oil and cook under a preheated grill for 8-10 minutes, or on a barbecue, turning once until the onions are browned and the chicken is cooked through. 
| Arrange on serving plates with lime wedges and sprigs of fresh coriander. 
| Serve with a tomato, red onion and coriander salad and warmed naan breads.
