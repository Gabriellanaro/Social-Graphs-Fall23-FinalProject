===Description===




===Ingredients===
| 12 Small / Medium Rooster Potatoes 
| 24 bay leaves 
| 6 Sprigs of rosemary 
| 4 tablespoons olive oil 
| 75g Butter 
| Salt and Pepper


===Mise en place===
* Preheat oven to 200\u00b0C/400\u00b0F/Gas 6 
===Method===


| Cut each potato across its width in slices about 5mm apart but stopping about 1cm from the bottom so each potato is still joined at the base. 
| Break the bay leaves in half and insert them into the slices, pick sprigs from the rosemary and again place into the slices. 
| Season with salt and pepper. 
| Place the potatoes into a roasting tin, sprinkle olive oil over the potatoes. 
| Pour enough cold water into the pan, just enough to cover the bottom of the pan. 
| Cut the butter into pieces and place around the potatoes. 
| Place pan into oven to roast, baste regularly with the butter until the water evaporates and the potatoes are tender.
