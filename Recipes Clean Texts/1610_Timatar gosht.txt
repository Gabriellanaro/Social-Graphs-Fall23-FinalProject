===Description===

Timitar gosht (Hyderabadi Lamb with Tomatoes) is a nice spicy lamb curry that is fairly easy to make providing you have the spices to hand.  Try it with shoulder of mutton if you can obtain it.

===Ingredients===
| 560g (1 ¼ lb) shoulder of lamb, trimmed of fat and cut into cubes
| Juice from 1 lime
| 6 fat cloves of Garlic, peeled and crushed
| 2.5 cm piece  of ginger root, peeled and grated
| 1.5 teaspoons cumin seeds, ground to a powder
| ½ teaspoon turmeric powder
| 1.25 teaspoons sea salt
| 3 tablespoons ghee or groundnut oil
| 2 large onions, peeled and finely chopped
| 1 450 g can peeled tomatoes, mashed or the equivalent amount of fresh tomatoes, peeled and mashed. Good use for your tomato press!
| 3 to 6 fresh green chillies, cut into rings
| 15 basil leaves, torn or chopped
| Small bunch of coriander leaves, chopped
===Method===


| In a bowl, add the meat, garlic, ginger, turmeric, cumin, lime juice and 1 teaspoon of sea salt.  Mix well and refrigerate for an hour or so to marinade.
| Heat the oil in a wok and fry the onions for 5 minutes or until just browning.
| Turn up the heat, add the meat with marinade and stir-fry for a few minutes.  Reduce the heat to a simmer, cover and cook for 10 minutes, stirring now and then.
| Add the tomatoes, remaining salt, chillies and coriander and simmer gently, covered, for 50 minutes, stirring now and then.
| Add the basil leaves, stir well and serve.
===Chef's notes===
To pad this out, I also added a portion of frozen butternut squash, extra liquid squeezed out.  A few teaspoons of brown sugar made this dish perfect. Test, taste and adjust to suit your preference.
===Serving suggestions===
Serve with plain boiled rice and nan breads.
