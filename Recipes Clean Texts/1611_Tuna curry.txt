The Judge 

A nice, hot fishy curry!

===Ingredients===

| 3-4 bulbs garlic, crushed
| 2 bay leaves
| Â½ teaspoon salt
| 1 teaspoon ground cumin
| 1 teaspoon ground coriander
| 1 teaspoon chilli powder
| ?? teaspoons bird's eye chilli paste

| 2 large potatoes, peeled and and cut into 2.5cm cubes
| 300ml fish stock
| 4 tuna steaks
===Method===


| Heat the oil in a large deep frying pan and fry the cumin seeds for 2 minutes or until they begin to splutter.
| Add the onion, pepper, garlic and bay leaves and fry until the onion has started to brown.
| Stir in the salt, ground cumin, coriander and chilli powder and cook for about 3 minutes.
| Add the bird's eye chilli paste and cook for a further 1 minute.
| Pour in the tomatoes and fish stock and add the potatoes.
| Bring to the boil, reduce the heat and simmer for about 15 minutes.
| Meanwhile, heat a little oil in a frying pan and seal the tuna for 2 minutes on each side.
| Add the tuna fillets to the curry, cover, and simmer for 5 minutes or more until the fish is tender.
===Serving suggestions===
Serve with  cashew nut pilau rice,  naan bread or any other Indian flatbread.
===Variations===
Try this with swordfish steaks.

Substitute fresh tomatoes for tinned if desired, but they must be well ripened.  Also add other vegetables of your choice.
===Chef's notes===
Use your common sense as to how hot you wish this curry to be.  Just add the chilli powder and the bird's eye chilli paste a little at a time and keep tasting.  Remember that as the liquid evaporates, the more concentrated the heat will be.  The garlic quantity may seem excessive, but it isn't, honestly!
