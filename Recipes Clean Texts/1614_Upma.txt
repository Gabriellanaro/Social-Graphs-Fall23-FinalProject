Upma or uppuma, the popular South Indian breakfast dish is usually made with Semolina (called Rava or Suji in India).

===Ingredients===
| 1 cup Wheat Rava (Semolina)
| 1 tablespoon Cooking oil
| 1 teaspoon Mustard seeds
| 1 teaspoon Cumin seeds
| 1 teaspoon grated Ginger root
| 3 Green chillies
| 1 onion, peeled and chopped
| Salt to taste
| 3/4 cup of chopped Vegetables of choice: Peas, carrots, aubergines, potatoes, cauliflower, cabbage, tomatoes
| 3 tablespoons of grated coconut
| 4 teaspoons of coriander leaves
| 2 teaspoons Lemon juice (optional)
===Method===


| Dry-roast the semolina until it just begins to turn brown, then set aside.
| In a large saucepan/wok, heat the cooking oil.
| Add mustard seeds and wait for them to sputter. Then add cumin, ginger, green chillies and chopped onions and fry until onions caramelise.
| Add vegetables, salt and 1.5 cups of water, and bring to boil.
| Add the roasted rava, turn down the heat, and mix quickly to avoid lumps forming.
| The upma is done when all the water is absorbed by the rava.
| Garnish with grated coconut, chopped cilantro leaves and lemon juice.
