Smashing curry.

===Description===

A slight variation on a tasty curry from my early Indian cookery courses.

===Ingredients===
| 300 g of venison, cut into thin strips and bashed with the back of a heavy frying-pan, Jamie Oliver style, to tenderise.
| 2 teaspoons coriander seeds
| 1 teaspoon turmeric powder
| 1 teaspoon chili powder
| ½ teaspoon fenugreek seeds
| 1 teaspoon cumin seeds
| ½ teaspoon peppercorns
| 4 cloves garlic, peeled and crushed
| 2.5 cm (1\") peeled ginger, ½ grated, ½ julienned (cut into very thin strips)
| 6 curry leaves
| 100g coconut block
| 2 large onions, peeled and slices
| 200g tinned tomatoes or equivalent amount of fresh tomatoes
| 2 tablespoons of tomato puree
| 1 green chili, chopped finely
| 1 tablespoon malt vinegar
| 2 tablespoons ghee, oil or butter
| Sea salt to taste


===Mise en place===
* Grind all of the whole spices, except for the curry leaves,  to a powder in a coffee grinder or pestle and mortar.

===Method===


| Add the oil to a heavy frying pan or wok, brown the meat quickly over a high heat, remove and reserve.
| Fry the onions, garlic and grated ginger until the onions are sort, about 8 minutes.
| Add the ground spices and fry for a minute more.
| Stir in the tomatoes, tomato puree, vinegar, julienned ginger, meat and 1/4 a cup of boiling water and mix well.
| Cover and cook until the meat is tender, about 30 to 40 minutes.  If the meat is still tough, add another 1/4 cup of boiling water and continue cooking for 20 minutes more.
| Remove the cover, add the coconut block, green chili, season with salt, mix well and cook until the coconut is dissolved.
