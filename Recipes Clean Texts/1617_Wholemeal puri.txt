Love these, but I can never get mine to look like that - what's the trick?

 

Klapaucius 

Wholemeal puri or wholemeal poori is an unleavened flatbread, from India or Pakistan, that is quickly fried rather than being cooked on a tava.  It should be a little smaller than a roti or a chapati, about 13 cm (5\") round.

Whilst kneading dough can be therapeutic, if time is your enemy, then the food processor is your friend.

Puris are the perfect accompaniment to most Indian dishes.

===Ingredients===
| 1 cup atta flour or strong white flour
| 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
| Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
| 2 tablespoons yogurt (optional)
| Vegetable oil for frying
| Â½ cup water
===Method===


| Tip all of the ingredients and half of the water into the food processor with a plastic blade or dough hook attachment
| Blitz the mixture whilst adding a more water a little at a time until you have a soft, pliable dough that is not too sticky
| Remove from the processor, dust with a little flour and rest for 30 minutes in a bowl, covered with a damp tea-towel
| Divide into 6 equal parts and roll into balls
| With a rolling pin on a floured surface, roll each roti out into a disc, about 13 cm (5\") round
| Heat 2.5 cm (1\") oil in a wok or large heavy-based frying pan 
| Deep fry each puri, holding it under the oil with a slotted spoon until it puffs up which should only take a few seconds
| Drain on kitchen paper
