===Description===
[[Image:Part of a roast.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Bean and cheese patties as part of a roast]]
It is best use giant white beans for this, especially if starting with dried ones.  I used the Greek Fassolia Gigantes-Elefantes Kastorias, which are like large butter beans in appearance.
===Ingredients===

| 250g (cooked weight) large white beans, lightly mashed
| 50g panko
| 160g carrots, coarsely grated
| 100g hard cheese, grated
| Parsley to taste, chopped
| Olive oil
| 90g red onions, finely chopped
| Garlic, to taste, minced with a little salt
| 1 egg, beaten
| Salt and pepper

===Method===


| In a bowl, mix the beans, panko, carrots, cheese and parsley
| Heat a little olive oil in a pan
| Saut\u00e9 the onions until soft
| Add the garlic and cook for a minute or too - do not allow to burn
| Add to the bowl and mix thoroughly
| Stir in the beaten egg and the seasoning
| Shape into 8 patties
| Lay them on a tray and refrigerate for an hour to firm up
| Just before serving, heat some more oil in a large frying pan and cook on both side until browned
===Serving suggestions===
Can be served with salad as a light lunch or will go well as part of a vegetarian roast
