Wish lobster was cheaper!

Glorious, but sooo expensive.  Crayfish is a good and economical substitute.

===Description===

'''Dublin lawyer''' is the rich Irish seafood dish utilising fresh lobster, cream, whiskey and sometimes mushrooms.

It dates back many hundreds of years to a time when lobster was more plentiful and less expensive than it is today.

The dish can be made with fresh or pre-cooked lobster meat.  I have made successful facsimiles of this dish using prawns and crayfish tails.

===Ingredients===
| ½ teaspoon paprika powder.
| ½ teaspoon mustard powder.
| 3 tablespoons butter.
| 6 button mushrooms, sliced thinly.
| 4 spring onions, sliced on the diagonal.
| About 450 g (1 lb) of fresh or cooked lobster cut into chunks.
| 4 tablespoons Irish whiskey.
| 150 ml double cream.
| Squeeze of lemon juice.
| sea salt and freshly ground black pepper.
===Method===


| Mix the butter, paprika and mustard powder together.
| Heat the butter in a large frying pan.
| Saut\u00e9 the mushrooms for a few minutes until they take a little colour.
| Add the lobster and spring onions and saut\u00e9 until the lobster is cooked.  This should only take a few minutes.
| Add the whiskey - if you want to set fire to it, warm it a little first. Cook for a few minutes more.
| Add the cream heat through, season to taste with salt and pepper.
===Serving suggestions===
Serve over plain boiled rice, or a mixture of plain boiled rice and wild rice.

Serve in the halved lobster shell if you have it.
