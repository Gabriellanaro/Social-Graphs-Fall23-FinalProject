| 300g minced beef
| 200g baked beans
| 200g kidney beans, drained
| 1.5 teaspoons Marmite, Vegemite or Bovril

| Stir in the baked beans, kidney beans,  Marmite, Vegemite or Bovril, the dried mixed herbs and the chilli flakes.
| Transfer to a casserole dish.
| Meanwhile, boil the potatoes and the carrots until cooked - about 20 minutes.
| Drain and mash together, adding the milk and the garlic.
| Season to taste.
| Spread out the potato over the meat and bean mixture in the casserole dish and drag a fork through it to create a pretty pattern.
| Bake at 180\u00b0 C (350\u00b0 F - gas 4), [fan oven 160\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour] for 20 minutes.
