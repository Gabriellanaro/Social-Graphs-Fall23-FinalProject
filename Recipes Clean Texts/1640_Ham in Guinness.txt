Superb.  Sticky and tasty - marmalade is genius.

===Description===

A nice and easy method of cooking ham, which can be eaten hot or cold.

===Ingredients===
| 3 kg smoked half-ham on the bone
| 500 ml can Guinness or other stout
| 2 tablespoons dark brown sugar
| Pinch each of ground black pepper and mace
| 3 tablespoons of bitter orange marmalade
| Cloves to taste


===Mise en place===
* Soak the ham in cold water for 24 hours.

===Method===


| Drain the ham and place in a pan with the Guinness, 2 tablespoons of the sugar, black pepper, mace and enough cold water to cover.
| Bring slowly to the boil and simmer very gently for about 2½ hours until cooked.
| Leave to cool in the liquid for about half-an-hour, drain and remove the skin of the ham.
| Preheat the oven to 200\u00b0 C (400\u00b0 F - gas 6).
| Mix 3 tablespoons or marmalade together with 2 ladles of the boiling liquor to make the glaze.
| Baste the joint well and Bake for 30 minutes, basting every 10 minutes.
===Serving suggestions===
Serve with leafy vegetables or a green salad and new potatoes.  Also excellent in sandwiches.

===Chef's notes===
You can use any size ham you wish and adjust the amount of the other ingredients accordingly.  However, you will also need to re-calculate the boiling time by about 50 minutes per kg.  You may not need to soak the ham first if you buy one ready prepared. 

When cooking this, I adjusted the original recipe to match my tastes.  I do not like cloves, but I love chillies.  For the final roast and baste I used marmalade mixed with the boiling juices and a good teaspoon of smoky chipotole chilli powder for a little bite.
