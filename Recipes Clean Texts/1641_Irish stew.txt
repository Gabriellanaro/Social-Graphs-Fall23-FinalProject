===Description===

This delicious meal is easy to make - the ingredients are layered into a flameproof casserole dish and slowly simmered.

As Delia Smith suggests in one of her cook-books, serve it with crispy suet dumplings and boiled cabbage.

===Ingredients===
| 1.3 kg (3 lb) a mixed selection of neck cutlets and neck fillets of lamb
| 2 tablespoons plain flour
| salt and freshly ground black pepper 
| 350 g (12 oz) onions, peeled and thickly sliced
| 225 g (8 oz) carrots, scrubbed and cut into quite thick rings
| 2 leeks, well washed under running water, chopped
| 275 g (10 oz) potatoes, peeled and cut into thick chunks
| 1 tablespoon pearl barley
===Method===


| Trim the meat of any large areas of fat and discard (or feed to the birds)
| Add 2 tablespoons of plain flour to a saucer and season well with salt and freshly ground black pepper
| Coat each piece of meat in the flour and layer into a large flame-proof casserole dish
| Follow by carrots, onions, leeks and potatoes
| Continue layering until the ingredients are used up
| Sprinkle the pearl barley on the surface
| Season with salt and pepper
| Pour over 1.2 litres (2 pints) of boiling water
| Heat on the hob and bring to the boil, scooping and discarding any fat that rises to the top
| Cover with a sheet of tin-foil and then with the lid
| Simmer on your lowest heat for 2 hours
