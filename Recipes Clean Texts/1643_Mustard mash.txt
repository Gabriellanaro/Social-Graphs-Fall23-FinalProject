Another surprising staple, added to my repertoire.

===Description===

They say that the simple things are best, well this couldn't be better or simpler!

Ken, one of our neighbours, posted a picture of bangers and mash on Facebook, with the comment 'mustard mash'. As you can see, it looks fab. That was a new one to me, so I asked him for the secret!
===Ingredients===

| 1 portion of mashed potates for two people
| 2 teaspoons of ready-made mustard

===Method===


| While mixing the butter and milk (or cream) into the potatoes, add two teaspoons of mustard.
| Mash until well mixed.
| Serve with sausages, vegetables and gravy.
