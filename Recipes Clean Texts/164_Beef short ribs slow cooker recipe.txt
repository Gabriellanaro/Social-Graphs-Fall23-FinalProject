If you can get short ribs, give this a try!

===Description===

Having discovered a great supplier for my beef short ribs and making Barbecue beef short ribs, I thought I would try other ways of cooking them.  As they make such a substantial meal, I just used 2 ribs for 2 people.  This meant cutting the now frozen 4 ribs (pictured) in half.  You need a clean hacksaw for this, it's no job for a knife!

Normally I would brown the meat and onions, but I thought I would try to make this a speed preparation that you could throw in the slow cooker before going out for the day.  I'll cook it on low so all the collagen breaks down into lovely gravy.

If you get a chance, it helps to skim any excess fat and give it a stir halfway through, however, it will be fine without.

===Chef's notes===
Ask your butcher for 'beef short ribs from the plate', or Argentine ribs. You don't want back ribs as these are not the same.  I understand from talking to a butcher that this particular cut of beef is also known as 'Jacob's ladder'.

I've found it difficult to obtain beef short ribs from anywhere but a specialist butchers and even then, they needed to be ordered in advance.  I was delighted to discover F. Conisbee specialist butchers had them in stock. 4 Argentine ribs for \u00a321.04.  Robert cut them in half again lengthwise with the bandsaw. One of these half-ribs per person is plenty!
