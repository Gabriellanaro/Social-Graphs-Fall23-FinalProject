===Description===



This recipe is for the sourdough starter from the '''[http://www.cookingisfun.ie/ Ballymaloe Cookery School]''' in Co Cork, Ireland.  This can be made using strong white flour but it is recommended that you use spelt flour as it has better aerating qualities.

===Ingredients===
| 300g spelt flour
| 300ml spring water or mineral water
| 450g strong white bread flour
| A further 450ml water
===Method===


| Mix 50g spelt flour and 50ml of bottled water in a kilner jar or Lock&Lock jug which has a capacity of at least 2 litres.
| Cover, and leave overnight at room temperature.
| 24 hours later add, mix in a further 50g spelt flour and 50ml water.
| Continue to add the same amount of flour and water until a total six batches have been mixed in every 24 hours.
| It is best to use the starter straight away, but it can be stored in the fridge indefinitely, in which case it will need to be refreshed before use.
| 24-36 hours before you want to make the bread, pour the starter into a bowl and mix in 225g of the strong white flour and 225ml of the water.
| Cover tightly with cling-film and allow to stand at room temperature overnight.
| Add the remaining flour and water, mix well, and allow to stand for a further 5-6 hours, by which time it should be light and bubbly.
| The starter dough is now ready for use according to your sourdough bread recipe.
===Chef's notes===
'''Do not use tap water as it contains chlorine.'''
If the mixture becomes too thick, add a little more water.
