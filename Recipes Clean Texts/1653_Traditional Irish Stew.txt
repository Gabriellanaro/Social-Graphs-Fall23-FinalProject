===Description===

This recipe for irish stew (Stobhach Gaelach) is from the 1950s and is about as traditional as I can find.  Just meat, potatoes and onion - no barley or other veg. You can cook this either on the hob or in the oven.

===Ingredients===

| 1 kg scrag end of lamb or mutton, cut into cutlets and fat trimmed
| 1.8 kg potatoes, peeled and cut in half or quarters, depending on size
| 500 g brown onions, thickly sliced
| Seasoning
| 570 ml meat stock (hot stock if cooking in the oven)
| A sprig of rosemary
| A few sprigs of thyme
| 2 bay leaves
===Mise en place===

* If cooking in the oven, pre-heat to 150\u00b0C (fan 130\u00b0C) / 300\u00b0 F / Gas 2

===Method===


| Take a deep saucepan or casserole, depending on how you want to cook it and add a layer of half the potatoes, then the meat, and then the rest of the potatoes, seasoning well between layers.
| Add the remaining ingredients.
| Firstly cover the pan with some greased tin foil, and put the lid on.
====For cooking on the hob====

| Bring to a gentle boil, reduce the heat and simmer gently for 2-2\u00bd hours.  As the pan is so tightly covered, you may find a heat diffuser useful.  Also you need to shake the pan at times, to prevent sticking.
====For cooking in the oven====

| Place the casserole into the pre-heated oven and cook for 3 hours (possibly a bit less for fan).
| In either case, the stew should not be too liquidy - it is not soup - and the potatoes will help to thicken it up.
===Serving suggestions===
Serve with soda bread or other rustic bread
