===Description===

Wholemeal flour soda bread, known as '''wheaten bread''' in Northern Ireland, is traditionally made with wholemeal flour, bread soda, salt, and buttermilk.  It is usually a savoury loaf, but can be made with raisins, nuts, eggs, etc.  This is the savoury version.

===Ingredients===
| 350g wholemeal flour
| 100g strong white flour
| 300ml buttermilk
| 1 heaped teaspoon bicarbonate of soda
| 1-2 teaspoons salt to taste
| 1-2 teaspoons sugar to taste
| 50g porridge oats (optional)


===Mise en place===
* Preheat the oven to 220\u00b0 C (425\u00b0 F - gas 7)
===Method===


| Sift both the flours, salt, sugar, bicarbonate of soda and oats (if using) in a large bowl.
| Add buttermilk and mix to a dough with your hands, stopping as soon as it feels pliable. Over-kneading will result in a heavy loaf.
| Shape into a ball.
| Place onto a greased baking tray or use Bake-O-Glide.
| Cut a deep cross in the top of the loaf so it will create four large crusts as it rises and bakes.
| Bake for 30 to 35 minutes.
| Loosely cover with tin-foil if the crust looks too brown.
| The bread is properly baked when it sounds hollow if tapped on the base.
| Cool on a wire rack for 10-15 minutes.
===Serving suggestions===
Serve warm with lots of butter.
===Chef's notes===
Make this immediately the dough has been kneaded.  The rising effect of the bicarbonate of soda only lasts for a short time so if you delay the result will be a heavy dense loaf.

Use bicarbonate of soda, not baking powder.

See here for various ways of making your own buttermilk.  I think the best way is to make your own cheese!
