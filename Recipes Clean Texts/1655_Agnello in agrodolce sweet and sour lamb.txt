===Description===

Eastern influences can be found in all agrodolce recipes, not least, this lamb dish.

This is a delightful recipe, but don't expect it to be the same as the bright orange Chinese version that you may be familiar with! 

===Ingredients===
| 1 large onion, peeled and thinly sliced
| 5 tablespoons of olive oil
| 5 tablespoons full cream milk
| 3 tablespoons tomato pur\u00e9e
| 1 kg (2 lb) lamb shoulder, cut into bite-sized cubes
| 125 ml high quality white wine vinegar
| sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
| 2 tablespoons granulated sugar
| 6 fresh basil leaves, roughly chopped
===Method===


| Fry the onions in half of the olive oil until golden brown and reserve.
| Meanwhile, mix the milk and tomato paste together.
| Brown the lamb in the remaining oil.
| Season the meat with a little salt, add the onions back to the pan and pour in the tomato mixture.  I added just a few tablespoons of water at this stage as it looked as though it would not survive an hour of simmering.
| Simmer gently for about an hour.
| After an hour, add the vinegar, sugar and a good grind of black pepper then cook for the final 15 minutes.
| Chop the basil and add just before serving.

===Variations===
Try this with duck or rabbit.
===Chef's notes===
Making this for 2 people, I used 350g of lamb shoulder fillet, but kept the remaining ingredients the same. I reduced the simmering time to 30 minutes as it was nice tender fillet.
===Serving suggestions===
While plain boiled rice is probably the thing to serve with this, it went really well with spaghetti.
