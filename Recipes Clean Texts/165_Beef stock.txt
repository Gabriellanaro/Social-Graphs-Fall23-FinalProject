Stocks are a fiddle to make and this, I'm afraid is no exception. However, if you want a restaurant quality beef stock, this is it.  Freeze in plastic coffee cups and you won't have to use an Oxo cube for months!

See your butcher for the beef bones.

===Ingredients===
| 3.7 kg (8 lb) beef bones (shin, leg or ribs)
| 6 litres (10.5 pints) cold water
| 1 tablespoon sunflower oil
| 2 carrots, washed and sliced
| 2 leeks, well washed and chopped
| 2 onions, halved, skin on
| 2 sprigs of thyme
| 2 bay leaves
| 3 sprigs of parsley, with stalks
| 20 black peppercorns 
| Good pinch of salt


===Mise en place===
* Preheat the oven to 200\u00b0 C (400\u00b0 F - gas 6)
===Method===


| '''Dark beef stock'''
| Place the bones in  a large roasting tray and roast for 40 minutes
| '''Light beef stock'''
| Omit the step above, then...
| Place the bones in your biggest pan and cover with 6 litres (10.5 pints) of cold water and bring to the boil
| Reduce the heat, cover, leaving the lid slightly ajar and simmer for 1.5 hours, skimming any scum from the surface
| In a wok or frying pan, sautee the onions until soft, about 4 minutes
| Add the onions and the rest of the ingredients to the beef and simmer, lid ajar, for a further 2 hours - again, skimming any scum from the surface
| Allow to cool slightly and strain without disturbing the ingredients or forcing them through the sieve(or you will cloud the stock
| Allow to cool and refrigerate or freeze
