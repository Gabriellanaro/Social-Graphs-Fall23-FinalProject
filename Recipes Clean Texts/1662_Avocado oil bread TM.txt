===Description===

This recipe is the same as that for Olive oil bread except that I have substituted avocado oil for olive oil and have adapted it for preparation in a Thermomix.

===Ingredients===TM
| 15g fresh yeast or 1x7g sachet of fast-action dried yeast 
| 320g sparkling mineral water 
| 500g strong white bread flour 
| 20g semolina 
| 10g salt 
| 50g avocado oil + 4 tablespoons, plus a little extra for greasing and brushing
| Coarse rock or sea salt (I used Himalayan Pink rock salt)
| Dried or fresh oregano, to taste
===Method===


| Place the yeast and the water in the TM bowl and if using fresh yeast, allow it to dissolve in the water.
| Add the flour, semolina, salt and avocado oil and mix for '''20 seconds / Speed 4'''.
| Put on '''Knead''' setting for '''4 minutes'''.
| Leave to rest until the dough is touching the '''MC'''.
| Use a little avocado oil to grease a bowl and turn out the dough onto a floured surface.
| Shape the dough into a ball, place in the bowl and cover.
| Leave until almost doubled in size and turn out the dough.
| Lightly oil a pie dish (see Tips/Hints below) and place the dough in the pie dish. 
| Drizzle the 4 tablespoons avocado over the top and push the dough gently towards the sides of the dish. 
| Cover and leave to prove for 45 minutes. 
| Dimple the dough sporadically and prove for a further 30 minutes. 
| Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 220\u00b0 C (425\u00b0 F - gas 7), [fan oven 200\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]. 
| Sprinkle the dough with the oregano and coarse sea or rock salt. 
| Bake in the oven for 25-30 minutes. 
| Slide onto a wire rack and brush with a little more olive oil whilst still hot. 
| Allow to cool before cutting or tearing.
===Serving suggestions===
This is delicious on its own, no butter needed so very healthy! Good with cheese and salad
===Variations===
You can add other ingredients to it such as herbs, Crushed garlic or dried chilli flakes. Also use different oils such as olive oil, but make sure they have a fairly high smoke point. 
===Chef's notes===
The tin I used to make this bread is made by Falcon, It is an '''[http://www.amazon.co.uk/Falcon-Enamel-24cm-Oblong-Dish/dp/B000TAVXYI/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1310850610&sr=8-3 enamel pie dish]''' measuring 24cm and is just right for this bread. These dishes are easy to clean - if anything sticks, just soak in hot water for a short while. They are also very inexpensive.
