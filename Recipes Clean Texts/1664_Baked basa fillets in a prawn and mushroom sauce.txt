This is a winner.  Anything in Lobster Bisque is good, especially basa.

===Description===

Basa fillets baked in a prawn and mushroom sauce, Filetto di basa al forno con salsa di gamberetti.  Using mushroom soup is a  clever cheat that takes all of the hard work out of this recipe.

This dish will serve from 2 to 6 people using the same basic ingredients, just add more prawns and basa, you'll just have more sauce if you're feeding 2 people with it.

===Ingredients===

| 1 small onion, peeled and finely chopped
| 1 tablespoon butter
| 225 g (8 oz) peeled cooked prawns
| 2 tablespoons of dry sherry
| 1 can of mushroom soup
| 4 basa fillets
| sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
| Freshly chopped parsley to garnish
===Mise en place===

* Preheat the oven to 180\u00b0 C (350\u00b0 F - gas 4), [fan oven 160\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]

===Method===


| Using a small pan or wok,saute the onions in the butter over a gentle heat for 5 minutes.
| Add the sherry and prawns for the last minute.
| Mix in the mushroom soup.
| Pour a little of the soup mix into the bottom of an ovenproof dish, lay the fillets over the sauce and cover with the remaining sauce.
| Season and bake for 25 minutes.
===Serving suggestions===
Serve with pasta or plain boiled rice and garnish with parsley.
===Variations===
Use cod, basa, sole or any firm fleshed white fish.

I added a handful of chopped oyster mushrooms a the prawn stage to make this dish moor mushroomy!
