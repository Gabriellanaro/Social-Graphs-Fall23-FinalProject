===Description===

I think I first had this in a pub in Croydon.  Because of this dip, I ate so much bread that I left most of the main course.

As well as tasting so good, it looks so wonderful.

Great with diagonally sliced, toasted French stick, pitta bread, ciabatta or focaccia bread.

===Ingredients===
| 30 ml extra virgin olive oil
| 15 ml balsamic vinegar

===Method===

| On a white plate or large saucer, pour out the olive oil
| Drizzle the balsamic vinegar randomly into the oil
| Serve
===Serving suggestions===

Serve as a dip to accompany pitta bread.
