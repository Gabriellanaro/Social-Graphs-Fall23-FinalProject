An interesting dish that, served with crispy bacon and mushrooms, would make a great breakfast.

These could also be served as a meze, topped with horseradish cream.

===Ingredients===
| 150 g (5 oz) polenta
| 75 g (2.75 oz) self-raising flour
| ½ teaspoon table salt
| ½ teaspoon baking powder
| 1 large egg
| 250 ml (8 fl oz) buttermilk or buttermilk substitute
| 2 corn cobs or 1 small can of sweetcorn, well drained
===Method===


| Add the polenta, flour, salt and baking powder to a bowl and mix well
| In a separate bowl, whisk the buttermilk and egg together
| Combine the two and mix well
| Refrigerate for 30 minutes to allow the mixture to combine
| If using cobs, strip the kernels; stand them upright on the fat end and run a sharp knife down against the cob
| If using canned sweetcorn, drain well
| Stir the kernels into the mixture
| Dollop a few spoonfuls onto an oiled barbecue hotplate
| Cook for 4 minutes per side
===Serving suggestions===
