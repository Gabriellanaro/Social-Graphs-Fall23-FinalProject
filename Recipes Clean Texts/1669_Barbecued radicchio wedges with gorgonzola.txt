===Description===

A superb starter or side-dish for the barbecue now that our meagre summer months are almost here.

===Ingredients===
| 2 radicchio heads, outside leaves removed
| Olive oil
| 150 g (5 oz) Gorgonzola cheese


===Mise en place===
* Cut each radicchio into 8 wedges
===Method===


| Brush both sides of the wedges with olive oil.
| Arrange on an oiled barbecue grill on a medium heat.
| Cook for 12 minutes, turning so they don't burn too much.
| Dot with small pieces of gorgonzola and allow to melt a little.
| Serve immediately.
