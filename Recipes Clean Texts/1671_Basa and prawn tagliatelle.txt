This is a variation of a recipe I saw on Channel 4's The Big Breakfast, about 15 years ago.

It's the simplest recipe I know - You cannot fail to impress with this dish.

There is an even simpler version here.

===Ingredients===
| 250 g fresh tagliatelle
| 1 tin lobster bisque soup
| 250g Basa fillets [9 oz]
| 100 g (3.5 oz) or more, fresh peeled prawns
| 3 tablespoons dry sherry
| 125 ml single or double cream
| Big handful of parsley, chopped - keep some whole for the garnish
| Chopped chives (optional)
| Squeeze of lemon juice
| Freshly grated black pepper
| Pinch of salt
| Â½ clove garlic
===Method===


| Cut the basa into bite-sized chunks - basa does not usually have skin or bones; remove them if it does.
| Rub the bottom of the pan with the cut edge of the garlic and discard the clove.
| In a large pan, almost bring the soup to the boil and then immediately reduce to a simmer
| Place the basa chunks in the soup and simmer for 6 minutes
| Cook the pasta as directed, drain and cover
| Add the prawns, cream, sherry, chopped parsley, salt and black pepper, stir for a minute or so
| Pour the pasta into the soup, mix well, serve with parsley garnish
===Serving suggestions===
Serve hot, maybe with a salad if you need to stretch it to four people.  There is enough here for two gluttons though!
===Variations===
Use 100g  of dried tagliatelle instead of fresh pasta

Smoked basa works well with this recipe.
