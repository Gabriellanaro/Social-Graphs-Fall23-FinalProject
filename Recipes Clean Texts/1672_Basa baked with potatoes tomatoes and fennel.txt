[[Image:Basa baked with potatoes, tomatoes and fennel recipe ready to bake.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Prepared, ready to bake]]
A nice fish dish that is a complete meal and has a Mediterranean feel to it.
===Ingredients===

| 2 basa fillets, about 250 g in total
| 6 thin slices of salami or pepperoni
| 2 large scrubbed potatoes, unpeeled and sliced into 3cm discs
| 1 large onion, peeled and sliced
| About 8 cherry tomatoes, halved
| 4 slices of lemon
| 4 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed
| A few stems of parsley
| A small sprig of thyme
| 3 fresh bay leaves, crushed to release the flavour
| 4 tb olive oil
| A small fennel bulb, finely chopped
| Himalayan sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
===Mise en place===

* Preheat your oven to 200\u00b0 C (400\u00b0 F - gas 6), [fan oven 180\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]

===Method===


| Add all of the ingredients apart from the basa and salami into a Lock and Lock box
| Cover and gently shake to mix well and coat with oil
| In a suitably sized baking tray, make a 'bed' with half of the contents
| Add the fish, cover with the salami slices and cover with the remaining ingredients
| Bake for 30 minutes
===Serving suggestions===
Serve with slices of lemon and a small bitter leaf salad
===Variations===
Whole fish could be used instead of fillets.  Increase the heat to  220\u00b0 and bake for 35 minutes if not using fillets.
