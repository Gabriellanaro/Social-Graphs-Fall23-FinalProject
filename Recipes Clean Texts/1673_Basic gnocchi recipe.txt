A lot of work for an indifferent result - I much prefer home-made pasta to this.

This dish is the basic recipe for making potato gnocchi to which you can add a sauces of your choice.

===Ingredients===
| 275 g (10 oz) potatoes, ideally Desiree or King Edward
| 1 egg, beaten
| 95 g (3Â½ oz) plain flour, sifted
| Salt and freshly ground black pepper
===Method===


| In a large pan, cover the unpeeled potatoes with boiling water salted water
| (Boiling in their skins prevents too much water being absorbed into the potatoes so try not to damage the skins)
| Bring back to the boil, cover and simmer for 25 minutes
| Drain, pat dry on a tea-towel and allow to cool so they can be handled safely
| Run the skins off and pass through a potato ricer or use a hand whisk to break up into a very fine mash.  It's worth taking care over this you will have lumpy gnocchi
| Add the sifted flour and half of the beaten egg
| Knead with your hands to a soft dough, correcting with extra egg or flour if too wet or dry
| Transfer to a floured cutting board, dry and dust your hands with extra flour
| Divide into four and roll each piece into a sausage about 1 cm (1/2\") diameter then cut into 2.5 cm (1\") sections
| Using the times of a fork, press flat into each piece to make the sauce-holding pattern, the rougher the better, we want rustic!
| Cover and chill until required
| (Gnocchi does not keep well without discolouring so only make what you are going to use on the day)
| Warm a serving dish in the oven
| In a large pan, bring 4 litres (7 pints) of water to a simmer
| Add the gnocchi and cook for 3 minutes, they will float after 2 but still need another minute
| Drain, transfer to the warm serving dish
| Drizzle your chosen sauce over the gnocchi and serve immediately
