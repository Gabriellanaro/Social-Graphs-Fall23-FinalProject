===Description===

This is a light adaptation of Jamie Oliver's basic risotto recipe from his book '''The Return of the Naked Chef''' (ISBN 0140292616)

===Ingredients===
| 60ml olive oil
| 2 medium onions, finely diced
| Garlic to taste, finely diced
| ½ head of celery, finely diced
| 400g arborio rice
| 250ml dry white wine
| 1 litre hot vegetable stock
| Seasoning
| 80g butter
| 130g Parmesan cheese, freshly grated
===Method===


| Heat the oil in a large saucepan and slowly fry the onions, garlic and celery until soft.
| Increase the heat add the rice and fry, stirring constantly for about a minute until it looks slightly translucent.
| Add the wine, and still stirring, cook until it has been absorbed by the rice.
| Next, add a pinch of salt and add a ladle of the hot stock.
| Reduce the heat so that the liquid simmers quite vigorously, but does not boil.
| As the rice absorbs the stock, keep adding more, a ladleful at a time, constantly stirring the rice gently.
| When all the stock has been used and absorbed, the rice should be soft, but still be slightly al dente.
| Remove from the heat and stir in the butter and the Parmesan and check seasoning.
| Cover and leave to rest before serving.
===Variations===
This is just a basic recipe.  You can add other ingredients of your choice to personalise it to you taste.
===Chef's notes===
Parmesan cheese is quite salty, so do not be heavy handed with the salt.
