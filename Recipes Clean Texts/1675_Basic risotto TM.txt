===Description===

This is Jamie Oliver's basic risotto recipe from his book '''The Return of the Naked Chef''' (ISBN 0140292616) adapted for making in a Thermomix

===Ingredients===
| 130g Parmesan cheese, cut into 4 or 5 pieces
| 2 medium onions, quartered
| Garlic to taste, peeled
| ½ head of celery, each stick cut into 4
| 60ml olive oil
| 400g arborio rice
| 250ml dry white wine
| 900ml hot vegetable stock
| 70g butter
| Seasoning
===Method===


| Grate the Parmesan by dropping it onto the running blades at '''Speed 8'''.
| Tip out and reserve.
| Add the onions, garlic and celery and process for a few seconds at '''Speed 4½''' until they are finely chopped.
| Scrape down the sides with the spatula, add the olive oil and saut\u00e9 for '''20-25 minutes/Temp. Varoma/Speed 1/Reverse Blade Direction/Measuring Cup OFF '''. 
| Add the rice and cook for '''3 minutes/Temp. Varoma/Speed 1/Reverse Blade Direction/Measuring Cup OFF'''.
| Pour in the wine and cook for '''2 minutes'''.
| Add the stock and cook for '''15-17 minutes/100\u00b0/Speed Spoon/Reverse Blade Direction/Measuring Cup ON'''.
| Add more water during the last few minutes of cooking time if it looks dry and taste to make sure it is 'al dente'.
| If it looks too wet, cook with '''Measuring Cup OFF''' for the last few minutes.
| Empty into a serving bowl
| Add the Parmesan, butter and seasoning and stir with the spatula.
| Serve immediately
===Variations===
This is just a basic recipe.  You can add other ingredients of your choice to personalise it to you taste.
===Chef's notes===
Parmesan cheese is quite salty, so do not be heavy handed with the salt.
