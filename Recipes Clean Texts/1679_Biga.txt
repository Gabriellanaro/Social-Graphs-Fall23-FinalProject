Makes a lovely light and airy bread with loads of big holes in it.

===Description===



Biga is an Italian bread starter which helps to develop flavour and create a more open texture and chewy crust.  It is often used when making ciabatta.  You need to make this the day before you use it

===Ingredients===
| 150ml tepid water
| 3mg fresh yeast
| 250g strong white bread flour
===Method===


| Dissolve the yeast and the water and place the flour in a bowl.
| Once the yeast has completely dissolved, mix throroughly with the flour.
| Cover the bowl with cling film and leave to ferment overnight.
| If your kitchen is hot, keep it in the fridge, but allow it to come to room temperature before using.
===Servings===
400g of biga
===Chef's notes===
The mixture does seem quite dry, but it will hold together with a little perseverance.  It can be left in the fridge for a couple of days longer if you wish.
