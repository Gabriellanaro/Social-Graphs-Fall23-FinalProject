These Fried Fish are battered and deep-fat fried. You'll need thin fish filets that don't fall apart when cooked.

Ideally serve with chips.

===Ingredients===

| 2 Thin fish fillets (suggested: cod fillets, basa fillets, catfish fillets, tilapia, or flounder)
| Oil with a high smoke point (groundnut oil, canola oil, sunflower oil)
| 1 Egg white, whisked
| 1 cup plain flour (all purpose flour)
| \u00bd pint (236 ml, 1 cup) beer or lager, or \u00bd pint (236 ml, 1 cup) cold water
| Â½ teaspoon baking powder
| extra flour to dust the fish
===Method===


| Start heating the oil. This recipe is intended for fast cooking in very hot oil.
| Get the batter ingredients ready to mix.
| Microwave the fish, to ensure that the inside is hot. Flip the fish as you microwave it. When done, the fish should be hot and should look half-cooked.
| Mix the flour, egg white, and beer.
| Pat a fish dry with a paper towel, then lightly dust it with flour to ensure that it is really dry.
| Dip the fish, and your hand, into the batter. Coat them well. The batter will help protect your hand from splatter.
| Hold the fish right above the oil, then gently slide the fish into the oil.
| With tongs, nudge the fish as needed to keep it from sticking to the bottom. Turn the fish over as it cooks.
| Remove the fish when it looks good, then serve it immediately.
