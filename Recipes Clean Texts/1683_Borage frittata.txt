Not a huge fan of borage, but if you like cucumber I suppose it's fine.

===Description===

Frittata (basically an Italian omelette) is a quick and easy dish to make, though you will probably struggle to obtain borage unless you grow it yourself.

You could probably substitute finely sliced cucumber for the borage, though I'm not certain there would be any point in that!

===Ingredients===
| 50 g (2 oz) stale bread, crusts removed
| 5 tablespoons olive oil
| 600 g (1 lb 5 oz) borage leaves, finely chopped
| 4 free range eggs
| 2 tablespoons freshly grated Parmesan cheese
| 6 fresh marjoram leaves, chopped finely
| Â½ clove of garlic, peeled and crushed
| Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
===Method===


| Tear the bread up into a bowl and cover with cold water and leave to soak for 10 minutes
| Squeeze out the water so it's soggy, but not dripping wet!
| Heat 3 tablespoons of olive oil in a saucepan, add the borage and heat gently until it wilts
| Beat the eggs together with the Parmesan, the soaked bread, marjoram and garlic.
| Season with salt and pepper.
| Heat the remaining oil in a frittata pan or a frying pan.
| Pour in the mixture and pat down.
| Cook gently for 15 to 20 minutes, turning so both sides are golden brown.
