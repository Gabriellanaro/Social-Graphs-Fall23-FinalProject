===Description===

[[Image:Capus ii recipe.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Capus]]
Capus (or cap\u00f9s, cap\u00f9s de Bolben) (in Trentino dialect means \"cappucci\", i.e. caps in English) is a typical dish from [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolbeno Bolbeno] and other places in [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giudicarie Valle Giudicarie],Trentino-Alto Adige in Italy. 
They are traditionally made in August during the village feasts or festivals.

===Ingredients===
| at least 120 vine leaves (ideally [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitis_labrusca vitis lambrusca])
| 400 g of breadcrumbs
| 400 g of grated grana trentino cheese
| 4 free range eggs, beaten
| 200 g of butter
| 100 g of sultana grape raisins
| 1.5 Kg of Swiss chard
| 4 cloves of garlic
| 100 g of pine nuts
| salt and pepper
===Method===


| cut the swiss chard into strips, boil and cut them thin
| mix all the other ingredients (but the vine leaves)
| wash the vine leaves and use a pair of leaves to wrap small rectangular shaped (the size of a business card, height 1.5 cm) portions of the mix, tie each with a cotton thread
| boil them in salted water for 30 minutes
===Serving suggestions===
If you cannot resist, you can eat them cold. But they are meant to be eaten cold, perhaps with a glass of Rotari Brut Trento Talento Riserva.
