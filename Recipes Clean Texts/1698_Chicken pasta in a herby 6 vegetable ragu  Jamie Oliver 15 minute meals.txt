===Description===

Another of my takes on Jamie's 15 minute meals.  Keeping it fairly close to his original, the only differences being that I'll use tagliatelle, rather than wholewheat fusilli as I find fusilli quite a 'heavy' pasta, and the wholewheat version even more so.  I'll use my home smoked bacon and some nice mature Mah\u00f3n-Menorca cheese instead of parmesan.

I think you would be pushed to prep this meal in 15 minutes, let alone prep and cook.  Anyway, a brilliant meal and well worth making.  I've used 3 chicken breasts and this will stretch to 6 servings if your not too greedy.

===Method===
'''pasta sauce'''

| Quarter the leek lengthwise, keeping the past part uncut in order to feed through the food processor easily
| Slice the celery into four, lengthwise, leaving the leafy end uncut for the same reason
| Peel, top and tail the carrot and slice into 4 lengthwise, ditto with the courgette
| Cut the pepper into strips
| Feed all of the vegetables through a food processor with a thin slicing cutter so they are all finely chopped, feed them through a second time if need be
| Add the olive oil and a grind of black pepper to an iron casserole dish and heat over the hob
| Add the thyme leaves picked from the sprig and the vegetables and pan-fry for 10 minutes stirring regularly
| After the vegetables have been cooked, stir in the passata and simmer gently
'''pasta'''

| Meanwhile cook the pasta in boiling salted water for about 6 minutes or  according to the packet instructions
| Hammer the chicken breasts flat and cut into a 2 cm dice
| Heat a tablespoon of olive oil and a grind of black pepper and the sprig of rosemary and the bay leaves in a separate pan or wok and stir-fry the chicken until golden and properly cooked
| Cut the bacon into fine slices, crush the garlic and finely chop the chilli
| Add these to the chicken and stir fry with the pine nuts until the bacon is browned
| Drain the pasta, reserving a little of the cooking liquor to loosen the finished dish
| Mix the pasta and the sauce, adding a little of the liquor to loosen it if needed
| Scatter the chicken and bacon over the pasta and garnish with finely grated Mah\u00f3n-Menorca cheese and a little chopped parsley
| Serve!
