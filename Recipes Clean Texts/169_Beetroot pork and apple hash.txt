===Description===

We are trying to achieve the 5 a day vegetable regime and to this end, I created this dish, loosely based on the beetroot rosti.  It was fabulous.  You could probably make a neater version by frying individual patties.  I was more concerned with getting it to the table and eating it so I cooked the whole thing as you would with bubble and squeak, patting it flat in the frying pan and constantly turning it over to ensure that it's cooked evenly.  Add a splash of olive oil to the pan if it appears to be drying out.  I wouldn't worry about the toasty burnt bits either as they are delicious in their own right.  A very successful experiment which went very well with purple sprouting broccoli, sauteed in olive oil and a few crushed cloves of garlic.

Swap out the pork for feta cheese or halloumi cheese and you have a vegetarian version.

===Ingredients===

| 3 cooked beetroots, grated and squeezed dry (or spun in a salad spinner)
| 1 cooking apple, peeled, cored and grated
| 200 g cooked gammon or ham, shredded
| Freshly ground black pepper and a pinch of salt
| Olive oil

===Method===


| Mix all of the ingredients together in a bowl
| Heat a few tablespoons of olive oil in a heavy based frying pan
| Fill the pan with the mixture and pat it flat
| Cook on a medium heat for about 5 minutes
| After 5 minutes, stir the mixture up with a fish slice and turn portions of the hash over to ensure its toasted all over
| Repeat for 10 minutes so the apple, beets and ham are caramelised
===Serving suggestions===
Serve with purple sprouting broccoli sauteed in crushed garlic and olive oil and new potatoes
