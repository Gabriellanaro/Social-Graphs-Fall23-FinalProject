I always think it needs lots of sauce

===Description===


This is a pasta dish which is quick to make and contains some of my favourite ingredients.

===Ingredients===
| 400g penne
| Garlic to taste, finely chopped
| Red chilli flakes to taste, finely chopped
| olive oil
| A generous knob of butter
| 125g Grana Padano cheese, grated
| Flat-leaved parsley to taste, chopped
===Method===


| Heat a pan of lightly salted water until it is boiling.
| Add the pasta and boil for 10-12 minutes until the pasta is al dente.
| Meanwhile, gently fry the garlic and chilli flakes in the olive oil.
| When the pasta is cooked, drain into a colander and return it to the pan with the garlic, chilli flakes, the oil in which they were fried, the butter and the cheese.
| Heat through until the butter has melted, stir in the parsley and serve immediately.
===Variations===
You can use any strongish, hard cheese and vary the pasta shapes.
===Chef's notes===
I made the mistake of buying 'chilli' penne from Asda.  Although it looks reddish, there is no heat in it whatsover.
