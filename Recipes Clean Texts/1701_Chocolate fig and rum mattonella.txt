===Description===

Mattonella (Italian for 'brick') is a chilled, Italian dessert which comes in many forms.  It is quite rich and it is often 'set' in a loaf tin to give it a brick shape.  This version with figs, is particularly suitable at Christmas time.
===Ingredients===

| 100g dried figs, stalks removed
| 100ml Dark rum (or enough to cover the figs)
| 250g dark chocolate, broken into small squares
| 125g dark sugar
| 50g of butter
| 100ml whipping cream
| 125g plain or spiced biscuits, coarsely chopped
====To finish====
===Ingredients===NB
| 250ml whipping cream
| 2 tablespoons icing sugar
| Ground cinnamon or cocoa

===Method===


| Place the figs in a bowl and add enough rum to cover (see '''Variations''' below)
| Leave for at least 30 minutes to marinate.
| Drain thoroughly, chop into small pieces and reserve.
| In a fresh bowl, over a saucepan of water, melt the chocolate with the sugar and butter.
| Remove from the heat, add the cream, figs and biscuits.
| Pour the mixture into a loaf tin which had been lined with foil or Bake-O-Glide.
| Smooth it out and refrigerate for several hours.
| Just before serving, cut the Mattonella into slices and put 2 slices on each plate.
| Whip the cream with the icing sugar and pipe some shapes onto the plates.
| Sprinkle the cream with a little ground cinnamon or cocoa powder.

===Chef's notes===
I used a 500g loaf tin with a volume of about 800ml.  This tin could have taken half the mixture quantity again.  A 250g tin was too small.
