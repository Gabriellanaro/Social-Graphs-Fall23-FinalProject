Too cold to be from Etna!

 

The Judge 

According to food writer, Jeffrey Steingarten; \"chocolate granita has a tradition in the city of  a tradition in the city of Catania\" (Sicily).

I can't say how traditional this version is but it tastes good!

===Ingredients===
| 750 ml water,
| 12 teaspoons caster sugar
| 55 g Unsweetened cocoa powder
| 55 g dark chocolate, chopped
| Â½ teaspoon vanilla extract
| Sprig of fresh mint to garnish.
| A few drops of peppermint extract (optional).
===Method===


| Add the sugar and water to a saucepan and bring to the boil.
| Simmer vigorously for about 10 minutes so the liquid reduces a little.
| Remove from the heat and add the coco, chocolate and mint essence if using.  Stir well until properly mixed.
| Allow to cool then refrigerate for a few hours.
| Place in your ice-cream maker, 60 minutes is perfect in our Cuisinart model.
| Freeze in an airtight Lock&Lock type box.
===Serving suggestions===
