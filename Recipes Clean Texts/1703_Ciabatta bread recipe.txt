Ciabatta (''carpet slipper'') because of its shape, is an Italian white bread made with wheat flour and yeast. The dough for this loaf is quite wet, hence the 'collapsed' shape.
===Ingredients===

====for the starter====
===Ingredients===NB
| ½ teaspoon dried yeast
| 150 ml tepid water
| 3 tablespoons tepid milk
| ½ teaspoon honey
| 150g strong white flour
====for the dough====
===Ingredients===NB
| ½ teaspoon dried yeast
| 350g strong white flour 
| ½ teaspoon olive oil
| 200 ml water
| 1.5 teaspoons fine sea salt
===Mise en place===

* Make the starter first, bear in mind it will need to rest overnight in a warm place.

===Method===


====Starter====

| In a very large bowl, sprinkle the yeast into 150 ml of water mixed with 3 tablespoons of milk.
| Leave for 10 minutes then stir in the honey
| Mix in 150 g of strong white flour to make a fairly loose batter
| Cover with a damp tea-towel and leave in a warm place for 12 hours
====Dough====

| In a small bowl sprinkle ½ teaspoon of dried yeast into 240 ml of tepid water,  together with ½ teaspoon of olive oil. Give it a quick stir then leave for 10 minutes to dissolve
| Add this mixture to the large bowl together with 350 g of strong white flour and 1.5 teaspoons of fine sea salt
| Using a wooden spoon, beat this mixture for at least 5 minutes until fully combined
| Use a silicone spatula to collect the dough residue from the edge of the bowl, cover with a damp cloth and leave for 3 hours in a warm place until doubled or trebled in size
====Proving====

| Be very gentle at this stage as we don't to ''knock the dough down
| Generously flour 2 baking sheets and have a small bowl with extra flour for your hands
| Using a dough scraper divide the dough in two.  My dough was slightly too wet so it was easier to pour the dough onto the floured sheet.
| Using well floured hands, shape the loaf by tucking the sides under themselves until you have the classic flat elongated shape.
| Repeat with the second loaf
| Preheat your oven to 220\u00b0 C (425\u00b0 F - gas 7), [fan oven 200\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]
| Leave the loaves to prove for 30 minutes, during which time they will spread out more
| Bake to 30 minutes in the middle of the pre-heated oven.
| Allow to cool on a wire rack.

===Variations===
If using fresh yeast, use 2.5 g of fresh yeast for the starter and 2.5 g of fresh yeast for the dough

==Chef's notes==
'''Using a breadmaker:'''
Kneading this mixture with a wooden spoon was hard work to say the least.  The second time I made these, I transferred the dough mixture to our Panasonic SD-ZB2502 automatic breadmaker for the kneading process.  I set it to pitta bread (22) and let it run for 10 minutes, then switched it off and left for 3 hours to rise.  It was easy to ''pour'' the dough onto the baking sheets, using a knife to cut the dough.
