===Description===

[[Image:Ciabatta loaves with breadmaker dough and oven bake rising.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Waiting for the loaves to double in size]].

This Italian bread is made using two doughs.  The mixing and first rising are done in a Panasonic breadmaker.  The second rising and baking are not.  Start the day before you want to eat the bread.

This recipe is basically the same recipe as parmesan ciabatta, but without the cheese! 
===Ingredients===

====1st dough====
===Ingredients===NB
| 1/8 teaspoon easy-bake dried yeast [0.5 g]
| 125g strong white bread flour
| 105ml water [105g]
====2nd dough====
===Ingredients===NB
| 1/2 a teaspoon of easy-bake dried yeast [2 g]
| 125g strong white bread flour
| 115g plain flour
| 1/2 a teaspoon  of salt 
| 1 tablespoon olive oil
| 30ml milk [30g]
| 150ml water [150g]

===Mise en place===

An hour before you are ready to bake the loaves, preheat your oven to 220\u00b0 C (425\u00b0 F - gas 7), [fan oven 200\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour] and leave it at this temperature fr an hour before baking.
===Method===


====Starter dough====

| Add the ingredients for the first dough to the breadmaker pan in the order in which they are given.
| For Panasonic SD253 and most breadmakers, set to 'Basic Dough'. 
| For the Panasonic SD-ZB2502 automatic breadmaker set to menu option 16, basic dough.
| When when the cycle has finished, switch off the machine and leave to rest at room temperature for about 18 hours.
| ''I make this recipe alot and sometimes the breadmaker does not mix the starter dough properly.  This is because of the small amount of dough in the starter. If this happens I just use a spoon to stir in any unmixed flour and re-run the dough procedure a second time.  I've always had perfect results doing this.'' 
====Main dough (second rise)====

| Add the ingredients for the second dough to first dough in the breadmaker pan in the order in which they are given.
| Set to 'French Dough' Panasonic SD-ZB2502: option 21 - 3 hours 35 mins.
| The dough should be quite sticky when finished.
| Turn out onto a lightly floured pastry mat or board and cut the dough into two.
| Shape each piece into oblongs of about 25cm each on baking trays or stones, which have been dusted with flour or semolina.
| Cover with a damp tea-towel and leave to rise in a warm place until the dough has doubled in size. ''My loaves puffed up to about twice the volume but the footprint stayed roughly the same size.'' 
====Baking====

| Preheat the oven to 220\u00b0 C (425\u00b0 F - gas 7) and keep it hot for one hour before baking.
| Shake the risen loaves onto a pre-heated oven tray or pizza stone andBake the bread for about 20 minutes until golden brown.
