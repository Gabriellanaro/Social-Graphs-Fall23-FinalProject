Lots of work

Like most artisan breads, this takes lots of work.  Lovely to get the big airy holes is the rolls though.

This ciabatta is based on a recipe by Richard Bertinet in his book '''Dough''' (ISBN 1856267628).  Ciabatta flour can be obtained online from Shipton Mill.

'''For the biga'''
===Ingredients===
| ½ level teaspoon fresh yeast
| 180g sparkling mineral water
| 350g ciabatta flour
'''For the dough'''
===Ingredients===NB
| 10g fresh yeast
| 340g sparkling mineral water
| 50g olive oil
| 450g ciabatta flour
| 15g salt
| Extra olive oil for oiling
| 20 g Semolina for dusting - optional
===Method===

'''The biga'''

| Dissolve the yeast in the water
| Mix all the ingredients in a bowl by hand or in a mixer for 5 minutes until you have a stiff dough.
| Cover with clingfilm and leave it in a draught-free area for 24 hours.
'''The dough'''

| Dissolve the yeast in the water and then add olive oil.
| Sieve the flour and salt into a bowl and mix in the water, yeast and oil.
| Then, add the biga and mix thoroughly.  (This is a very wet mixture so I would recommend using a mixer with a dough hook).
| Knead using your chosen method.  (You can also do this using your food mixer on the second highest speed for 4-5 minutes).
| Oil another large bowl and pour the dough into it.
| Allow to rise in a warm place until it has a bubbly and light texture (about 1½ hours), covering the bowl with clingfilm.
| Gently deflate the dough with floured fingers and repeat the previous step or leave in the fridge overnight.
| If the dough has been in the fridge bring it to room temperature before continuing with the next step.
| Generously flour your work surface and using your dough scraper turn out the dough in one piece.
| Flour the top of the dough and using your fingers, gently dimple it.
| Divide the dough into 4.
| For each piece of dough, fold one side of it into the middle and press down and seal with the heal of your hand.
| Fold the other side unto the middle, pressing and sealing in the same manner.
| Finally, fold in half lengthways and seal the edges so that you end up with a long shape.
| Place the pieces of dough onto a couche cloth or piece of linen which has been floured with rye flour.
| Make ruches in the cloth between each piece of dough, to prevent them from spreading too much, but do allow a little spreading room.
| Cover with tea towels and allow to prove for about 45 minutes.
| Preheat the oven to its highest temperature with a tray half-filled with boiling water placed on the bottom. If using a baking stone, put it in the oven before you turn the heat on.
| Flour a baking tray or peel, pick up one ciabatta at a time, turn it over, stretching it lengthways a little at the same time and lay on the peel or tray.
| Transfer to the oven, reduce the heat to 220\u00b0 C (425\u00b0 F - gas 7) and bake for about 20 minutes until light golden brown.
| Allow to cool on wire racks.

===Chef's notes===
Ciabatta freezes well.  Just reduce the initial baking time to 15 minutes, cool, freeze and bake for 15-20 minutes straight from frozen.
