===Description===

Granita is the classic Sicilian sorbet-type ice.  I wouldn't bother making this with instant coffee.  If you have no other option than instant, then make it double strength.

This is basically a coffee and rum Slush Puppy!

===Ingredients===
| ¾ cup granulated sugar
| 1.5 cups of water
| 2.5 cups of strong coffee
| Splash of rum
===Method===


| Mix the sugar and water in a heavy pan, heat until the sugar dissolves.
| Boil carefully for 5 minutes.
| Remove from the heat, add the coffee and mix well.
| Allow to cool then refrigerate until very cold.
| Add a splash of rum at this stage.
| Add to your ice-cream maker and process as directed. About 1 hour should be fine for most machines.
| Freeze in a Lock&Lock type box.
===Serving suggestions===
To serve, scrape the surface with an Ice-cream scoop, scraping up the ice crystals.  Serve in small, chilled dishes.
===Variations===
Freeze in small amounts, like ice-trays and process to slush in a food processor with a blade.  Serve immediately.
