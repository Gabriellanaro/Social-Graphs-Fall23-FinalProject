Very healthy for you though.

===Description===

Another great way to use your home-grown courgettes.  Using a mandoline peeler, shave the courgettes into ribbons of pasta.  You could use a food processor but the result would not be so aesthetically pleasing.

I've included this in our pasta category, even though it contains no pasta.  It could possible be a gluten free pasta?
===Ingredients===

| 2 or 3 courgettes, depending upon the size
| 3 tablespoons olive oil
| A good pinch of freshly ground black pepper
| 1 chile de arbol
| 1 medium sized red onion, peeled and very finely chopped
| 3 cloves of garlic, peeled and crushed
| 30 g of parmesan cheese, grated
| 80 g strong cheese of your choice cut into shaving with a speed peeler. I've used a nice gruyere
| 6 tablespoon of good tomato sauce (I've used some of my Tomato sauce for pizza)
| A good pinch of fresh herbs to garnish

===Method===


| Using a speed peeler or mandoline, shave the courgettes into ribbons
| Add a good pinch of black pepper and the (whole) chili to the olive oil and heat in a large frying pan or wok.
| Add the chopped red onion and saute for 3 or 4 minutes
| Stir in the crushed garlic and before it gets a chance to colour, add the courgette ribbons
| Stir fry the courgettes, turning often, until they are done to your liking
| Discard the whole chili and add the shaving of strong cheese to the pan stir well and serve immediately before the cheese melts too much
| Place the warm tomato sauce on the plates and spoon the courgette mixture over the top
| Dress with fresh herbs and a good sprinkle of parmesan cheese
===Chef's notes===
If you don't have any decent tomato sauce to hand, take a little from a bottle of shop-bought bolognese sauce or similar and freeze the remainder in small portions for future use with similar recipes.
