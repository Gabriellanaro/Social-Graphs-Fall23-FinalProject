Even here in the country, I find it almost impossible to but the flowers - I need to grow them myself I guess.

Courgette (zucchini) flowers filled with cream cheese and deep fried in a crispy tempura batter is probably not something you would have everyday, but very nice for special occasions.

'''flowers and filling'''
===Ingredients===

| 8 courgette flowers with baby courgettes still connected
| 225g (8oz) ricotta cheese
| zest and juice of 1 lime
| Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
| plain flour for dredging
| Vegetable oil for deep frying
'''for the tempura batter'''
===Ingredients===NB
| 75g plain flour
| 75g cornflour
| \u00bd teaspoon sea salt
| 188 ml [6.5 fl oz] sparkling water, beer or lager. Must be ice cold.
| 1 free range egg - lightly beaten
===Mise en place===
* Heat the oil in either a deep fat fryer or a large saucepan. If you are using a saucepan make sure the oil comes below halfway down the edge of the pan. If you have a thermometer it needs to reach 190C, but you can test that it\u0092s ready by dropping some bread into the oil and it should brown in 20 seconds.
===Method===


| Mix the ricotta cheese, lime juice and zest in a bowl and season with salt and black pepper
| Spoon enough filling into each flower, leaving enough room to close the flowers.  A wooden cocktail stick is helpful to hold the flowers closed while frying. 
| Set the flowers aside and prepare the batter
| Ensure the water is ice cold.
| Sift the flour, cornflour and salt together into a bowl. 
| Make a well in the centre of the flour and pour your chosen liquid together with the previously beaten egg into it.
| Using a balloon whisk, very gently combine ingredients into a rough batter.
| It is very important that it is not overmixed at this stage as that will make the batter stodgy.
| Once your batter is 'runny' enough to coat your chosen filling, stop mixing, even if this leaves the odd lump in the batter.
| When you are ready to cook, dredge each flower in plain flour, dip into the batter and deep fry for 3.5 minutes
| Leave on kitchen paper to drain excess oil 
| Cooked tempura can be kept warm in an oven at 150\u00b0 C (300\u00b0 F), with the door left ajar to keep it crispy.
===Chef's notes===
Lumpy batter is good,  It ensures that you do not overwork the batter and turn it into stodge.
