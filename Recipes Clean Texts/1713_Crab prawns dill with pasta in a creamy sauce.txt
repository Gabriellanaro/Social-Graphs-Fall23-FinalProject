Make this really simple, quick and delicious meal - it's great if you can make your own pasta.  If not then use about 200g of ready-made fresh pasta. All supermarkets now stock fresh pasta, usually in the chiller.

| 114g fresh premium claw crabmeat
| 75g cold water prawns (about half a small packet)
| 3 fresh tomatoes, quartered
===Method===


| Heat 1 teaspoon of butter in a pan and add a pinch of black pepper
| Peel and finely chop a medium and gently saut\u00e9 in the butter for 5 minutes
| Cook the past for 4.5 minutes in fast boiling salted water
| Drain, reserving a little of the water to loosen the sauce if needed
| Stir the cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche into the onions and lower the heat
