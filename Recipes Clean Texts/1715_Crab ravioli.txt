===Description===

Crab ravioli and lobster bisque is a deliciously fishy way to get your pasta hit.

===Ingredients===

| 1 portion of fresh pasta
| 200 g of white and brown crabmeat (2 small pots)
| Juice and zest of half a lemon
| 2 tablespoons of chopped parsley
| sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
| 1 can lobster bisque (soup)
| A few tablespoons of single cream to garnish (optional)
===Mise en place===

* Make the fresh pasta, cover with cling film and leave in a cool place for an hour.

===Method===


| Mix the crabmeat, lemon zest and juice, chopped parsley, sea salt and freshly ground black together in a bowl
| Dust a cutting board with light yellow cornmeal or plain flour
| Using a pasta making machine, roll the pasta into a couple of sheets and lay out on the cutting board
| Add a teaspoon of crabmeat mix at regular intervals along one edge of the pasta sheet
| Brush the edges where they will join with a littl eof the egg-white reserved from making the pasta, or a tiny amount of water
| Bring the empty edge over to cover the crab filling and press firmly down where they will join.
| Cut the joins with a pizza cutter or a ravioli cutter
| Separate the ravioli and reinforce the joins by pressing down on the edges with the tines of a fork
| Refrigerate the ravioli for an hour so the pasta can firm up and the flavours of the crabmeat mingle
'''to cook'''

| After making this many times, I prefer to cook the ravioli first in boiling salted water and then finish by heating in the lobster bisque.  This ensures the ravioli is nicely cooked, otherwise it can be too al dente for my liking.  It does also mean that you can cook the ravioli a little ahead of time and just reheat in the soup.
| Slide the ravioli into a pan of fast boiling salted water, bring it back to the boil and cook for 5 minutes.  A wok is ideal as it allows you to maneuver the pasta to ensure it's evenly cooked, without breaking it up.
| Add the lobster bisque to another pan and gently bring to a simmer
| Carefully slide the ravioli into the simmering soup and heat for 4 minutes
| it is important that you jiggle the pan every now and then to prevent the ravioli from sticking to the base of the pan

===Serving suggestions===
For  hint of luxury, drizzle a few tablespoons of single cream just before serving and serve with a green leaf salad of rocket and tomatoes
