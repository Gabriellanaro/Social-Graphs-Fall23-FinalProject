 The Judge 
===Description===

Another impressive recipe idea from D\u017eiugas cheeses with solid crispy cheese nests filled with salmon and ricotta cheese.

A great way to use up smoked salmon trimmings.
===Ingredients===

| 100 g D\u017eiugas cheese, grated
| 1 tablespoon sesame seeds
| 6 tablespoon Ricotta cheese
| 120 g smoked salmon trimmings
| Chopped fresh parsley
| Favourite herbs to garnish (basil, fresh thyme, dill etc.)
| 1 fresh lemon for garnish

===Method===


| Finely grate the D\u009eiugas cheese
| Heat a small non-stick frying pan, the same size that you want the wafers to be.
| Once the pan is hot enough to melt the cheese, sprinkle the cheese evenly over the surface of the pan in a thin layer and add a good dusting of sesame seeds.
| Once the cheese has crisped up, invert the pan over a suitably shaped item such as a soup ladle and tap the cheese pancake out over it and allow it to cool and harden.
| Mix the ricotta cheese, smoked salmon trimmings, chopped parsley, salt and freshly ground black pepper together in a bowl and add a tablespoons of the mixture into each nest.
===Serving suggestions===
Arrange fresh herbs over the top and add a drop of lemon juice and a tiny amount of freshly grated lemon zest.
===Variations===
If you cannot obtain D\u017eiugas cheese, a good quality Parmesan will work equally well.
===Chef's notes===
The Tefal one egg wonder 12 cm mini frying pan is absolutely the perfect size for this recipe.
