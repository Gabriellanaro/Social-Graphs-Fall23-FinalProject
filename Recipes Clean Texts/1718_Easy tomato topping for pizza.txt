===Description===

This cookery cheat comes from an idea used in one of American Julia's recipes.

She used it on a deep pan pizza.  I've been using it for pizzas ever since.

No cooking required, just wait 30 minutes for a tin of tomatoes to drain.

===Ingredients===
| 1 tin of chopped plum tomatoes
| sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
| Â½ teaspoon dried oregano
===Method===


| If you are using a can of whole tomatoes, roughly chop then whilst still in the tin by using a small knife
| Pour the can of tomatoes into a sieve placed over a bowl
| Leave to drain for 30 minutes
| Season to taste with salt and pepper
| Stir in the dried oregano
| Discard the drained liquid
| Spread on you pizzas just before baking
