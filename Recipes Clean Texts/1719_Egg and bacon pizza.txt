I wouldn't normally try pizza for breakfast but his looks like it should be worth trying!

[[Image:Egg and bacon pizza.jpg|thumb|300px|right|If it's not round, so be it!]]
As with any pizza, it's up to you what you put in it.  This one uses a spicy pizza topping with home smoked bacon, topped with an egg.

===Ingredients===
| 1 portion spicy tomato pizza topping (use a jar of shop-bought pizza sauce if you're stuck for time)
| 1 portion pizza dough - makes 2 pizzas
| 200 g (7 oz) mozzarella cheese (drained)
| 100 g good quality sliced meat (eg: prosciutto, salami, speck). I used 50g (2 oz) thinly sliced Home smoked bacon 
| 2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese
| 2 fresh free range eggs
| 1 tablespoon capers
| Fine yellow cornmeal for dusting


===Mise en place===
* Preheat the oven to 220\u00b0 c (425\u00b0 F - Gas 7)

===Method===


| Make 1 pizza per person
| Dust the work surface with Fine yellow cornmeal
| Roll or stretch the pizza bases out. I'm not good at getting them into neat circles, as long as there is enough room for the topping, I'm happy. 
| Prick the pizza all over with a fork. This prevents it puffing up too much and burning while it is cooking.
| Make the pizza up on a lightly greased, or lightly floured baking tray. It's very hard to transfer once made up, without a pizza peel.
| Divide the ingredients in two:
| Spread the tomato sauce over one the pizza
| Break the mozzarella into chunks and sprinkle over the sauce, followed by the capers, the sliced meat and half of the Parmesan cheese
| Break the egg in the centre of the pizza
| Sprinkle with the remaining Parmesan cheese
| Bake for 15 to 20 minutes - keeping your eye on it!
===Serving suggestions===

Serve hot or cold

Great with creamy coleslaw
===Chef's tip===

For an even better, more authentic pizza, use a pizza stone.
