Anything sauteed in Lobster Bisque and served with pasta is perfection in my eyes!

===Description===

The version of Salmon and prawn tagliatelle uses selected cuts of various fresh fish as often found in supermarkets.

You might have a job finding the canned lobster bisque - Baxters is good but not all supermarkets stock it - [http://www.sainsburys.co.uk/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/gb/groceries/baxters-luxury--lobster-bisque-soup-400g Sainsburys] has it in stock, as does [http://www.waitrose.com/shop/DisplayProductFlyout?productId=14429 Waitrose] and [https://www.amazon.co.uk/Baxters-Luxury-Lobster-Bisque-Soup/dp/B008FNSXL2 Amazon], should bulk-buying be your forte.
===Ingredients===
| 1 portion of fresh tagliatelle (about 250g) or 100g  of dried tagliatelle
| 1 tin lobster bisque soup
| 1 340 g pack of selected fish pieces - often labelled as 'seafood pie mix'
| 3 tablespoons dry sherry
| 125 ml single or double cream
| Big handful of parsley, chopped - keep some whole for the garnish
