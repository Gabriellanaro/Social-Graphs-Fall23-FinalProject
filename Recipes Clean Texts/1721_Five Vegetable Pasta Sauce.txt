===Description===

This recipe was derived as a result of having so many spare vegetables sitting in the fridge. It makes a thick, rich sauce perfect with pasta. The recipe freezes well so the ingredients can be increased for later use or to increase servings.

===Ingredients===
| 1 tablespoon oil
| 1 small red onion
| ½ leek
| 1 garlic clove
| ¼ red pepper
| 1 carrot
| 1 small courgette
| 1 tin chopped tomatoes
| 150ml vegetable stock
| 1 tablespoon Tomato puree
| ½ tablespoon Sun dried tomato puree (optional)
| ½ teaspoon sugar
| Basil

===Method===


| Chop all of the vegetables fairly small, ½ inch cubes or smaller.  It will save effort with the hand blender later and they will cook down quicker.
| Heat the oil in a large pan
| Fry the carrot first as ths will take longest
| Add the remaining veg, onion, leek, garlic, red pepper and courgette and cook until soft.  about 10 minutes.
| Add the tin tomatoes, sugar, stock and purees and give another few minutes to bring back up to heat.
| Dried or fresh basil can be used, add at the last minute before blending.  No need to chop first if using fresh.
| Using a hand blender straight in the pot is easiest although you can do this gradually in a worktop blender, blend until you reach a consistency you prefer.
| Freezes well and can be gradually defrosted from frozen on a low heat on the hob or in the microwave.
===Chef's notse===
Thank you Kitchenminion, for a wonderful recipe idea.  With the addition of a cheese topping, the ingredients shown served 2 people, for 2 days.  The only changes I made were to microwave the carrots first and add a pinch of ancho chile powder.
