===Description===

A version of Focaccia made in a Thermomix.

===Ingredients===TM

| 500g strong white bread flour (I used Sainsbury's Extra Strong Canadian flour)
| 1 x 7g sachet fast-action dried yeast or 15g fresh yeast
| 30g olive oil plus extra for drizzling
| 350g water (I used sparkling mineral water)
| 1 teaspoon fine salt
| 1 teaspoon coarse salt for sprinkling (I used pink Himalayan rock salt
| 2 tablespoons fresh rosemary leaves, chopped
===Method===



| Mix the flour, yeast, oil, water and fine salt '''20 seconds / Speed 6''', then '''2 minutes / Knead'''.
| Leave to rest until dough is pushing up the MC.
| '''10 seconds / Knead'''
| Leave to rest again until dough is pushing up the MC.
| Tip out the dough into an oiled baking tray 22cm x 33cm approx. and spread out using your hands.
| Cover and allow to prove until almost doubled in size.
| Make dimples in the risen dough with your fingers.
| Sprinkle the dough with the extra olive oil, the coarse salt and the rosemary.
| Sprinkle a little water over the top.
| Bake for 20-25 minutes 220\u00b0 C (425\u00b0 F - gas 7), [fan oven 200\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour].
| Remove from the oven and allow to cool on a rack.
===Recipe source===

* Lightly adapted from a recipe in '''Fast and Easy Cooking''' which is the book supplied with Thermomixes in the UK.
===Servings===
Servings: 10 - 1 large loaf

===Chef's notes===
To remove any dough that may become stuck under the blades spin '''5 seconds / Speed 6'''.

Aga:  Bake on the floor rack of the Roasting Oven for 18-20 minutes.

Although I used groundnut oil to grease the tin, the bread still stuck, probably due to the drizzled olive oil which soaks through the bread.  I would recommend lining the tin with something such as Bake-O-Glide.
