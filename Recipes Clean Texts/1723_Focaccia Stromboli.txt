===Description===

A rolled focaccia bread that is filled with mozzarella cheese that erupts from the surface when hot.

Best served whilst warm, directly from the oven.

The dough stage can be completed in a breadmaker but the final baking needs to be done in the oven.

'''for the focaccia bread'''
===Ingredients===
| 2 teaspoons of dried active yeast
| 350 ml water
| 500g (1 lb) strong white flour
| 1.5 teaspoon fine salt
| 3 tablespoons olive oil
''' for the topping and filling'''
===Ingredients===NB
| 200g (7 oz) mozzarella cheese cut into small chunks
| 2 Garlic cloves, 1 peeled and crushed, 1 thinly sliced
| A big handful of fresh basil leaves, roughly chopped
| 3 tablespoons of olive oil
| 1 teaspoon sea salt
| 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
| 1 tablespoon of finely chopped fresh rosemary leaves


===Mise en place===
* Preheat the oven to 200\u00b0 C (400\u00b0 F - gas 6)

===Method===


| If using a breadmaker make the dough using the longest dough setting you have, then follow the recipe from step 7
| For the Panasonic SD 253 breadmaker, use the French dough setting, for the Panasonic SD-ZB2502 automatic breadmaker, use menu option 21, French dough.
| Using a small bowl, add 250 ml of the (tepid / warm) water to a bowl and sprinkle the yeast over it.  Leave in a warm place for 5 minutes to dissolve.
| In a large mixing bowl, add the sifted flour and salt. Make a well in the centre and pour in the yeasted liquid.
| Mix with your hands, adding as much of the remaining warm water as needed to make a sort pliable dough.
| Tip the dough out onto a floured worktop and knead with your hands for 10 minutes so it becomes silky and elastic.
| Clean the large bowl,  lightly oil it (an oil spray is good for this), add the dough, cover with a damp cloth and leave to rise in a warm place for 2 hours.
| Knock down and leave to rest for 10 minutes.
| Shape the dough into a rectangle (35 cm x 20 cm (14\" x 8\")
| Cover with a cloth and leave to rest for a further 15 minutes.
| Sprinkle the cheese, basil, garlic and a little of the rosemary over the dough then, starting from one of the shorter side, roll up like a Swiss roll.
| Place on an oiled baking sheet and punch holes in the surface.  This is where the mozzarella cheese will erupt from while it bakes.
| Drizzle with half of the olive oil the sprinkle with chopped rosemary leaves, salt and pepper.
| Bake for 1 hour.
===Serving suggestions===
Drizzle with the remaining olive oil and serve warm.
===Chef's note===
If using a pizza stone follow the preheating directions and allow to heat in the oven and slide the focaccia onto the stone from a cornmeal-dusted pizza peel or similar.
