===Description===

Ok it's really cheesy peas, but is sounds so posh that it's staying as Formaggio piselli!

Really easy to make and as good with frozen peas as it is with fresh peas, which means you can make this with stuff from the fridge and freezer.

===Ingredients===
| 2.5 cups Frozen peas
| ¾ cup of Parmesan cheese (once grated)
| 1 tablespoon butter
| 1 juice and zest from half a lemon
| Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
| Pinch of sugar
===Method===


| Cook the peas to your liking:
|# Fresh peas - 4 minutes in boiling water
|# Frozen peas - From frozen - in a bowl with 1 tablespoon of water, cover with a saucer and microwave on full power for 4 minutes
| Drain and reserve a little of the cooking water.
| Add the peas to a small pan with the butter, a few tablespoons of the cooking water (or vegetable stock if you have some to hand), season to taste with salt, pepper and sugar.
| Tip the Parmesan cheese in and stir well to coat the peas, adding a little extra liquid if required.
| The end result should be glossy, well coated peas.
| Remove from the heat, drizzle with the lemon juice and sprinkle with the lemon zest.
