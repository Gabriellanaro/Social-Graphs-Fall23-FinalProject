A lovely way to serve spaghetti - the fresh basil leaves are the kicker.

===Method===


| Fill and boil the kettle. Cut the leeks into 8cm lengths. Split lengthways, then slice finely into julienne. Make a pile of the ham and slice across the depth to make similar strips.
| Melt the butter in a large frying pan and toss the ham in the butter, stir fry for a few seconds then add the leeks and cook on a low flame for about 8 minutes until the leeks are soft.
| Using the kettle water, boil the spaghetti with 1 teaspoon salt for 2 minutes. Drain and return to the pan. Add the buttery leeks, ham and balsamic vinegar, stir well and serve with chopped hazelnuts, fresh basil leaves and a grind of black pepper.
