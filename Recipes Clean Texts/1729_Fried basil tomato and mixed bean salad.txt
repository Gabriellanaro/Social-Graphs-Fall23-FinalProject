[[Image:Frying basil, tomato & mixed bean salad recipe.jpg|thumb|300px|right|..gently fry the basil leaves..]]
This unusual salad could be made with any tinned or presoaked beans or pulses, even whole chickpeas.

===Ingredients===
| 15g fresh basil leaves
| 40 ml extra virgin olive oil
| 300g cherry tomatoes (Sungold if you can get them)
| 400g can of mixed beans
| 1 tablespoon lime or lemon juice
| Sea salt & freshly ground black pepper
===Method===


| Keep back about a third of the basil leaves for garnish and then tear up the rest
| Heat the olive oil in a small pan and gently fry the remaining basil leaves for a minute or so until the leaves take a little colour
| Rinse the beans in a sieve under cold running water and drain
| Halve the tomatoes and arrange in a bowl with the beans
| Allow the basil soaked oil to cool a little and then pour over the beans and tomatoes
| Season with a little sea salt and plenty of freshly ground black pepper
| Toss the salad well and chill in a fridge for 1 hour so the flavours mingle
| Dress with the remaining basil leaves and sprinkle with lime juice
===Serving suggestions===
