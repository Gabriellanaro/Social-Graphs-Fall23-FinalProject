===Description===

Literally meaning 'drowned omelette' this recipe comes from the Arezzo area of Tuscany.

===Ingredients===
| 5 free range eggs
| 1 teaspoon plain flour
| 2 tablespoons dried breadcrumbs
| Seasoning
| Olive oil
| 1 onion, finely chopped
| 1 stick of celery, finely chopped
| 1 carrot, finely chopped
| Garlic to taste, finely chopped
| 6 ripe plum tomatoes, skinned, seeded and chopped (use canned if fresh are not available)
===Method===


| Beat the eggs in a bowl with the flour, breadcrumbs and seasoning.
| Heat some oil in a large frying pan until hot, the add the egg mixture.
| When the underside is cooked, slide it onto a plate and the back into the pan on the other side and cook until golden.
| Leave until it is totally cold.
| Meanwhile, fry the onion, celery and carrot until the onion is soft, then add the garlic and tomatoes.
| Season, mix well and simmer until you have a smooth, rich sauce - about 20 minutes.
| Cut the omelette into strips, add to the sauce and heat through for 5 minutes.
| Serve, sprinkled with the Parmesan cheese.
===Serving suggestions===
Grate some Parmesan cheese over the top and serve with a crunchy salad and some bread.
===Chef's notes===
If you do not have the confidence to slide the omelette in and out of the pan, you can cheat.  When the underside is done, cook the top under a hot grill.
