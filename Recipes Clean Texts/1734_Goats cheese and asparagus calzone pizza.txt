===Description===

The inspiration for this recipe came from Sophie Grigson and William Black's '''''Organic''''' cookbook ISBN0 747272204

I wanted something to use this year's meagre crop of giant asparagus, so this recipe seemed an ideal candidate.

The giant asparagus is a little on the woody side so it needs much more cooking than normal.

Eveything else was from either a fridge or a garden raid. We have our own hens so that's a help!

===Ingredients===
| 1 portion of pizza dough - Makes 2 pizzas
| 5 or 6 spears of giant asparagus
| 1 green bell pepper, roasted de-seeded and roughly chopped
| 220 g of goat's cheese
| 4 tablespoons of tomato sauce - see Chef's notes below
| 2 hard boiled eggs, peeled but left whole
| A handful of fresh herbs, chopped
| Extra virgin olive oil
| sea salt and freshly ground black pepper


===Mise en place===
* Chop the asparagus diagonally in 2cm slices, discarding the woodier parts from lower down.
** Normal asparagus can be left whole and blanched for about 3 to 4 minutes.
* Boil the asparagus for 10 to 12 minutes
* Roast the pepper - see here
* Make the pizza dough
* Preheat the oven to 220\u00b0 C (425\u00b0 F - gas 7), [fan oven 200\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]
===Method===


| Make 1 pizza per person
| Roll the dough out into two circles
| Divide the fillings into two portions, one for each pizza
| Spread the tomato sauce on to one half of the circle, leaving the edge free from sauce
| Crumble the cheese over the sauce
| Sprinkle the chopped herbs, asparagus and green peppers over the sauce
| Pop the egg in the middle, season with salt and pepper and give a final drizzle of olive oil
| Brush the clean edge with water or milk so it helps to make a good seal
| Fold the pizza Calzone folding
| Bake for about 20 minutes
===Variations===
* These pizzas are so versatile that you can put almost anything in them. They will get hot enough to melt the cheese but anything that might need pre-cooking needs to be done outside of the pizza.  They get ''just'' hot enough to cook a raw egg if that's any help.
===Chef's notes===
As we make pizzas so often, I divide up homemade tomato sauce into single-pizza-portions and freeze them in small bags.  If I've no homemade sauce, I cheat and use a few tablespoons from a bottle of ready made pasta sauce  and freeze the remainder as above.
