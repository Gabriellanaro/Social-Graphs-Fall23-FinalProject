===Description===

As a general rule, when you cook fish you want keep things simple and you don't want to ruin the delicate flavour of the fish with sauces (such as maionese): use just a little bit of lemon, olive oil, garlic and herbs such as thyme and oregano.

===Ingredients===
| 1 whole grey mullet (the common name in Italian is \"cefalo\" or \"muggine\")
| 1 lemon
| 1 garlic clove
| thyme (better fresh)
| salt and black pepper

===Mise en place===
* Preheat your grill or the oven to the highest temperature.
===Method===


| Mix the lemon juice and some of the rind grated, thyme and garlic finely chopped and salt
| Cut the fish two or three times on each side
| Place in a baking dish and pour the mix over, leave to marinate for half an hour turning it a few times
| Grill the fish for about 6-10 minutes each side (depending on the size)

===Serving suggestions===
You can serve with a green vegetable of your choice and/or boiled or roast potatoes.
===Variations===
Instead of thyme you can use oregano or rosemary.

Instead of grilling you can cook it in the oven at 200 \u00b0C for 15-30 minutes depending on the size of the fish. To check it is cooked try to remove a small piece: it should come away easily, if not put back in the oven for another 5 minutes and check again.
