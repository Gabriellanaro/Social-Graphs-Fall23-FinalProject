Really nice tastes. Any balsamic vinegar works well in this recipe. You don't need the expensive stuff!

===Description===

This recipe works well with any firm-bodied white fish, try it with basa fillets for a change.

===Ingredients===
| 4 fillets of white fish, such as basa, cod, haddock or sea bass 
| 300g basmati rice 
| 1 tablespoon Belazu olive oil 
| 4tbsp Belazu balsamic vinegar 
| 350g young spinach


===Mise en place===
* Preheat your grill or the oven (400F/200C/gas mark 6) depending upon your cooking preference.
===Method===


| Place the fish on a plate and season lightly with salt. Leave for 10 minutes. 
| Meanwhile, rinse the rice and place in a pan with 450ml cold water. Bring to the boil, then immediately reduce the heat to very low and cover the pan. Cook for 10 minutes. Turn off the heat and leave, covered, for 10 minutes.
| Boil the kettle. Preheat the grill to its highest setting. Rinse the fish and pat dry with kitchen paper.
| Smear the fish fillets with olive oil, place on 15cm foil squares and fold up the edges to make little boat.
| Splash each fillets with 1 tablespoon balsamic. Place on the grill pan and cook, placed about 6cm from the heat, for 5-8 minutes, depending on the thickness of the fillet, until just cooked through. If more convenient, cook the fish in hot oven (400F/200C/gas mark 6).
| Cook the spinach for 1 minute in boiling salted water. Drain in a colander, pressing out excess water.

===Serving suggestions===
Slip fish and juices on to a plate and serve with the rice and spinach.
===Variations===
Instead of grilling in tin-foil 'boats', I just marinaded the fish for 2 hours in balsamic vinegar and olive oil and then grilled for about 4 minutes a side, turning once - lightly oil the grill tray first to prevent sticking.

This was very nice served with new potatoes (Pink Fir Apple) and a small salad.
