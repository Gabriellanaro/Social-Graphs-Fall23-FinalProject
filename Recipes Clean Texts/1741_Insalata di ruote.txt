Much nicer than plain-old macaroni!

===Description===

Ruote is a wagon wheel shaped pasta and this is a salad made with prosciutto, anchovies and Parmesan cheese.

===Ingredients===
| 100 g ruote - see '''Variations''' and '''Chef's Notes''' below
| 2 thick slices bread, crust removed and cubed
| 90 ml olive oil
| Garlic cloves, to taste, cut in half
| 1 bunch spring onions, coarsely chopped
| Â½ small iceberg lettuce, shredded
| 50 g small mushrooms, wiped and sliced
| 100g prosciutto, diced
| 1 green pepper, diced
| 50 g anchovies, chopped
| 15 ml lemon juice
| 30 ml Worcester sauce
| Seasoning
| 6 baby tomatoes, halved
| 25 g Parmesan, shaved
| Small handful of black olives, pitted
===Method===


| Boil the pasta in a large saucepan of water until al dente - see instructions on packet.
| Drain, rinse and cold water and drain again, throughly.
| Fry the bread cubes in 30 ml of the oil until golden and drain on kitchen towel.
| Rub a salad bowl with the garlic cloves and discard.
| Add the pasta to the bowl, together with the lettuce, mushrooms, prosciutto and green pepper. Mix gently.
| Make a dressing with the remaining oil, lemon juice, Worcester sauce, seasoning and anchovies.
| Pour over the salad, add the bread and toss thoroughly.
| Garnish with the tomatoes, Parmesan and olives.
| Serve immediately
===Serving suggestions===
Goes well with plainly cooked steak or on its own.
===Variations===
As an alternative to ruote, try spighe or any other open pasta shape.
===Chef's notes===
Ruote and spighe are not very easy to find.  I have come across these types of pasta in Lidl's and some independent delicatessens.  Ruote can be obtained online from Fratelli Camisa.

Personally, I never bother rubbing garlic on the inside of bowls as you can hardly taste it.  I would prefer just to crush some up and mix it with the dressing.
