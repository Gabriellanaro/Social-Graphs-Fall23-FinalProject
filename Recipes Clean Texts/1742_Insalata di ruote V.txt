===Description===

Ruote is a wagon wheel shaped pasta.

===Ingredients===
| 100 g ruote - see '''Variations''' and '''Chef's Notes''' below
| 2 thick slices bread, crust removed and cubed
| 90 ml olive oil
| Garlic cloves, to taste, cut in half
| 1 bunch spring onions, coarsely chopped
| Â½ small iceberg lettuce, shredded
| 50 g small mushrooms, wiped and sliced
| 1 green pepper, diced
| 15 ml lemon juice
| 30 ml Worcester sauce
| Seasoning
| 6 baby tomatoes, halved
| 25 g Parmesan, shaved
| Small handful of black olives, pitted
===Method===


| Boil the pasta in a large saucepan of water until al dente - see instructions on packet.
| Drain, rinse and cold water and drain again, throughly.
| Fry the bread cubes in 30 ml of the oil until golden and drain on kitchen towel.
| Rub a salad bowl with the garlic cloves and discard.
| Add the pasta to the bowl, together with the lettuce, mushrooms and green pepper. Mix gently.
| Make a dressing with the remaining oil, lemon juice, Worcester sauce and seasoning.
| Pour over the salad, add the bread and toss thoroughly.
| Garnish with the tomatoes, Parmesan and olives.
| Serve immediately
===Serving suggestions===
Goes well with plainly cooked steak or on its own.
===Variations===
As an alternative to ruote, try spighe or any other open pasta shape.
===Chef's notes===
Ruote and spighe are not very easy to find.  I have come across these types of pasta in Lidl's and some independent delicatessens.  Ruote can be obtained online from Fratelli Camisa.

Personally, I never bother rubbing garlic on the inside of bowls as you can hardly taste it.  I would prefer just to crush some up and mix it with the dressing.

Vegetarians should read carefully the label on bottles of Worcestershire sauce.  The original contains anchovies, but some shops' own brand varieties do not.
