===Description===

An economical, quick and tasty evening meal.  Use a pork fillet, sliced into medallions or individual pork shoulder steaks.

===Ingredients===
| 1 large pork fillet, cut into medallions or 4 pork shoulder steaks
| 15 g butter
| 1 tablespoon olive oil
| 10 fresh sage leaves
| 4 cloves of Garlic, peeled and crushed
| 100 ml white wine
| Salt and freshly ground black pepper
===Method===


| Heat the oil and butter in a large frying pan on a medium heat and brown the steaks, turning often.  Continue cooking until the steaks are properly cooked, this will take about 15 minutes, less for medallions of pork.
| Drain any excess fat from the pan and add the garlic, sage and seasoning.  Fry until the garlic starts to take a little colour, then add the wine.
| Cover the pan and simmer for 3 minutes.
