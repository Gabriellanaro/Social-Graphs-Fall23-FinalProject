Not very Italian, I admit, but I preferred this with dumplings.

===Description===

More experiments with taste sensation's seasoning mixes, this time with Taste Sensation Italian seasoning also using up some leftover vegetables.  I don't think kidney beans are authentic for an Italian dish, but they help to pad out the protein and make the meal stretch to four servings.  They're tasty too as they soak up the flavours in the gravy.
===Ingredients===

| 530 g beef stewing steak
| 1 tablespoon Taste Sensation Italian seasoning
| 1 small red onion, peeled and finely chopped
| 1 yellow pepper, deseeded and chopped into small pieces
| 2 fresh tomatoes, finely sliced and chopped
| 250 ml red wine
| 1 tin Plum tomatoes
| 1 tin red kidney beans, well rinsed and drained

===Method===


| Add all of the ingredients to your slow cooker, stir well and slow cook on low heat for eight hours or so.
| Check now and then to ensure it does not dry out and add a little extra liquid if needed.
===Variations===
A recipe like this is ideally suited to using up leftover vegetables.  If you are using softer vegetables that are likely to turn to mush after prolonged cooking, add them during the last few hours of cooking.

Probably not authentically Italian, but I used the remaining meat, padded out by the kidney beans, to make two 'pies' with dumpling crusts - very good they were too. [75g suet, 150g self-raising flour - 200\u00b0C for 40 minutes].
