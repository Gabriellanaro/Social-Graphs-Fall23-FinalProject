This simple salad recipe was recommended to me by the glorious Annabelle.  She made it recently to accompany pork chops made with my Tex-Mex rub and barbecued chicken made with my Orange biter chilli sauce!

===Ingredients===
| 1 red onion, peeled and finely sliced into rings
| 2 x 15 ml red wine vinegar
| 12 small beetroot, cooked and peeled
| 2 tablespoons olive oil
| 3 tablespoons finely chopped fresh mint
| sea salt - optional


===Mise en place===
* Separate the onion rings, lay them out in a large flat lock and lock box, cover with the vinegar and leave for up to 3 hours.  Give them a shake now and then.
''The vinegar takes the harshness out of the onion. ''
===Method===


| Slice the beetroot and arrange on a platter.
| Dress with the sliced onions and the vinegar they have been soaking in.
| Sprinkle with the chopped mint and sea salt.
| Serve immediately.

Such an effortless recipe, and the results are great as an accompaniment for cured pork or gammon.
