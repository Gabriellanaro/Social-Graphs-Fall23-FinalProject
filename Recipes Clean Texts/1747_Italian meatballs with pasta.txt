The meatballs are great, but the finishing touch is the fresh basil.

 

 The Judge 
===Description===

A quick and easy meatball recipe. Serve with buttered pasta and a tomato sauce.  It's ideal for freezing, make double the quantity and freeze in small batches for extra quick meals.

This has to be a cheat because it's so simple to make.

===Ingredients===
| 500g (18 oz) lean minced beef
| 1 tablespoon freshly chopped oregano - ''see variations''
| 1 small onion, finely chopped
| 2 Cloves of garlic, peeled and crushed
| zest of 1 lemon, finely chopped
| 15 g (1/2 oz) fresh breadcrumbs
| sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
| Pinch of grated nutmeg
| 1 egg, beaten
''' for frying'''
* Olive oil
''' to serve'''
* 520 g Buttered spaghetti or buttered egg noodles
* 30 g Parmesan cheese - shaved with a speed peeler or freshly grated

===Method===


| In a large bowl, mix all of the ingredients with clean hands until nicely combined.
| Cover and refrigerate for 3 or 4 hours if possible for the flavours to mix.
| Divide the mixture into about 20 balls, roughly the size of a golf ball.
| Gently shallow fry in a little olive oil until browned on the outside and cooked to your liking. About 5 to 7 minutes, turning regularly - scrape from the pan with a spatula to prevent them breaking up.

===Serving suggestions===
Serve on a pile of buttered pasta or egg noodles and one of these tomato sauces

Garnish with shavings of Parmesan cheese.
===Variations===
Use pork instead of beef.

Try an Alfredo sauce instead of a tomato based sauce.

Use fresh basil as an alternative, or a mixture of basil and oregano (or marjoram), if using dried oregano, use 1 teaspoon.  Don't bother with dried basil.
===Chef's notes===
I forgot to buy the lemon for this recipe, so used slightly less than a quarter of the rind (flesh discarded) from one of my preserved lemons, finely chopped.
