===Description===


This interesting beetroot salad originates from Nik and Edwina's Cookbook.   This is the cold version, the hot version can be found here

To quote Nik:

\"It's earthy and sweet and fragrant and spicy and fruity, we served it at our wedding feast, and it went down a storm\"

===Ingredients===

| 500g beetroot, either freshly boiled, or from the supermarket (but make sure it'\u0092s not in vinegar)
| 4 oranges, Freshly squeezed. Use the juice and the zest
| 1 \u0096to 2 teaspoons allspice
| 1 teaspoons cornflour
| 1 tablespoon dark brown or muscovado sugar

===Method===


| Chop beetroot into skinny strips and arrange in a serving bowl
| Reserve 2 tablespoons of juice. Heat the rest with the zest, add 1 teaspoon of allspice and the sugar. Check for spiciness and add more allspice if you like it that way
| Mix the reserved juice with the cornflour. Add to juice in pan, heating gently, stirring constantly until the mixture has thickened a bit
| Pour over the beetroot and chill overnight so the flavours become bosom buddies.
| Take it out of the fridge in plenty of time to be able to serve at room temperature
