===Description===

A simple but strongly flavoured pasta main course served with rocket leaves.

I've used 2 dried Chile de \u00e1rbol which made this dish nice and spicy.  If you don't want it too hot then remove and discard the seeds.
===Ingredients===

| 455g dried spaghetti
| 4 cloves of garlic, peeled and crushed
| 400g peeled prawns
| 250 ml white wine
| 2 heaped tablespoons of sun-dried tomato paste
| 2 dried red chillies crushed in a pestle and mortar
| Juice from 1 lemon
| Zest from 1 lemon
| sea salt and freshly ground black pepper

===Method===


| Cook the spaghetti in plenty of boiling water for about 7 to 10 minutes
| Heat about 4 tablespoons of olive oil in a frying pan or a wok and gently cook the garlic and chili.  As soon as the garlic starts to colour, add the prawns.Don't allow it to brown or it will be bitter.
| Stir in the sun-dried tomato puree and let it sizzle for 30 seconds
| Add the white wine and stir well.
| Once the wine has heater through toss the pasta in the sauce, add the lemon juice and serve.
===Serving suggestions===
Mix with the rocket, sprinkle with the lemon zest and drizzle with olive oil.
===Variations===
A tablespoon of satay sauce added a little more 'fishiness' and a subtle sweet flavour.
