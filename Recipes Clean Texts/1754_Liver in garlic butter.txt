Another nice way to cook liver with as much garlic as you like!

As a habit, I like to soak liver in milk before cooking.  You can omit that step if you wish, other than imparting more garlic flavour, it probably doesn't make too much difference.

===Ingredients===

| 3 tablespoons butter
| Pinch of freshly ground black pepper
| 6 cloves of garlic, peeled and crushed
| 200 ml milk
| 200g lambs liver, deveined and thinly sliced
| 1 tablespoon picked thyme leaves
| 2 eggs, beaten
| 2 tablespoons of plain flour
| 25g breadcrumbs
===Mise en place===

* Add the milk, half of the crushed garlic and the sliced liver to a Lock and Lock box, cover, shake well and leave for an hour or two, shaking now and then.

===Method===


| Drain the milk from the liver using a sieve so you retain the garlic!
| Beat the thyme leaves into the egg
| Arrange the flour, breadcrumbs, egg wash on plates, and a spare plate for the coated liver
| Coat the liver in flour, dip in the egg wash and roll in the breadcrumbs
| Heat the butter in a frying pan and add the black pepper
| Add the remaining garlic to the pan and fry for one minutes
| Add all of the liver to the pan and cook for 5 minutes, turning once
| Remove from the pan and rest for 5 minutes
===Serving suggestions===
Serve with a light salad and tomatoes.  We had some leftover roasties too.  Yum!
===Variations===
We make breadcrumbs from the bread we bake everyday which makes this look rather 'gnarly'.  Normal breadcrumbs are fine.
===Chef's notes===
Add the flour to a Lock and Lock box with the drained liver, cover and shake well.  This is quick, easy and the best way to evenly flour the liver.
