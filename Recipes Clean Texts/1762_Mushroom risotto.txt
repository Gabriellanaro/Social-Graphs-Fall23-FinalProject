===Description===


This recipe is reproduced from the Chili lime deli's newsletter, with the kind permission of owner, John Caffrey

===Ingredients===
| 1 tablespoon dried mushrooms
| 2 tablespoons olive oil
| 1 onion, peeled and chopped
| 2 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed
| 225 g (8 oz) fresh chestnut mushrooms, sliced
| 350 g (12 oz) Arborio rice
| 150 ml (1/4 pint) dry white wine
| 1.2 litres (2 pints) hot vegetable stock
| 2 tablespoons fresh parsley, chopped
| 25 g (1 oz) butter
| Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
| Freshly grated Parmesan cheese to garnish
===Method===


| Soak the mushrooms in ''just boiled'' water for 10 minutes - reserve the liquor to add to the stock
| Heat the oil in a large pan and saut\u00e9 the onions and garlic for 4 minutes until softened. Add the mushrooms and saut\u00e9 for another 4 minutes until coloured
| Stir in the rice and coat well with the oil
| Pour in the wine and simmer until it has been absorbed into the rice
| Add a ladle of the stock, stir gently and simmer until the stock has been absorbed.  Repeat until all the stock has been absorbed and the rice is plump and tender.
| Roughly chop the soaked mushrooms, stir into the risotto with the butter.  Season to taste and serve immediately
===Serving suggestions===
Serve hot with grated Parmesan cheese
===Chef's notes===
When adding the stock a ladle at a time, don't be tempted to hurry this stage. Always wait until the last ladle has been absorbed before adding the next - it's going to take about 20 minutes to complete.
