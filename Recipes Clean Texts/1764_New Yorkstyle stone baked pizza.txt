This is so scrummy.  Ikea meatballs are great but balls of sausage-meat work are a favourite for these pizzas here at home.

===Description===

Having just got my pizza stone, I am rushing around trying to find pizzas that are really well suited to 'the stone'.

This one uses the grill, a pizza stone and the oven so it's as close to a proper pizza oven as you can get.

===Ingredients===
| 1 portion pizza dough - Makes 2 pizzas
| 150 g ball of mozzarella cheese, torn into pieces
| 1 spicy pepperoni-style sausage
| 300g cooked meatballs - (I used turkey and chicken meatballs from Waitrose - delicious)
| Extra virgin olive oil for drizzling
| 3 cloves garlic, crushed
| 1 cup spicy tomato sauce
| Handful of basil leaves, torn
| 1 tablespoon pickled capers
| 1 tablespoon fine yellow cornmeal


===Mise en place===
* Make the pizza dough as instructed
* If using a pizza stone, preheat the pizza stone under a very hot grill for about 20 minutes.  Place it about 8cm (3\") from the heat source.

===Method===


| Make 1 pizza per person
| Dust the work surface with fine yellow cornmeal
| Stretch or roll the dough into two thin rounds
| Sprinkle the stone with fine yellow cornmeal
| Prick the pizza all over with a fork. This prevents it puffing up too much and burning while it is cooking
| Pre-cook the empty pizza base on one side only for about 3 minutes or until it is lightly browned
| Remove from the oven, flip and add the topping.
| Lightly oil one side of the pizza and grill, oiled side down, flip an repeat, about 2 minutes per side
| Drizzle the pizza with olive oil and spread the pizza with ½ of the tomato sauce
| Top with torn mozzarella, Crushed garlic, sausage and meatballs
| Bake for 3 or 4  minutes or until the cheese browns a little - watch it carefully as it can burn easily.
| Remove and sprinkle with torn basil and capers
| Keep the fist pizza warm at the bottom of the oven whilst you make the second.
| Serve hot

===Chef's note===
If you don't have a pizza peel use an upturned plate, dusted with fine yellow cornmeal and some deft handwork to slide the dough onto the stone.
