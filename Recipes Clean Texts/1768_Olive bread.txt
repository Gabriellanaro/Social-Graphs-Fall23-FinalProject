The recipe is adapted from one by Andrew Whitley's book '''Bread Matters''' (ISBN 0007298498).

| 225g sponge, taken from the above
| 150g strong, white bread flour
| 75g strong wholemeal flour
| 4g finely ground sea salt
| 15ml olive oil
| 105ml water
'''For the bread:'''
===Ingredients===NB
| 30g pumpkin seeds
| 20ml olive oil
| The dough from above
| 90g black olive paste
===Method===

'''The sponge:'''

| Dissolve the yeast in the water and pour into a large bowl.
| Mix in the flours. cover with a lid or plastic bag and leave at room temperature for 16-48 hours.

| Spread the olive paste over the dough and roll up like a Swiss roll.

| Bake at 190\u00b0 C (375\u00b0 F - gas 5) for about 35 minutes.
===Chef's notes===
Black olive paste can be bought in Sainsbury's.  The dough will feel very oily, but that is fine.
