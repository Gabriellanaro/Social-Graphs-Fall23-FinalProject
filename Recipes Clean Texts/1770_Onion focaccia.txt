A very easy and basic focaccia recipe.

===Ingredients===
| 350g strong bread flour (I used Wessex Mill French bread Flour - similar to Type 65)
| ½ teaspoons salt
| 1 x 7g sachet Easy-Bake yeast, or 15g fresh yeast
| 200ml water
| 1 tablespoon olive oil
| ½ red onion, finely chopped
| Maldon sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
| 2 tablespoons olive oil


===Mise en place===
* If using fresh yeast, activate in the water.
===Method===


| Mix the first 5 ingredients and knead thoroughly.
| Place in a bowl, covered with some oiled clingfilm and put in a warm place until risen to double its size.
| On a floured board, knock back, knead, return to the bowl and allow to rise again to double its size.
| Knock back and place in a suitable receptacle, eg a shallow, greased 25cm cake tin - I used a rectangular Falcon enamel pie dish.
| Cover again in clingfilm and let it rise until twice the height.
| Preheat your oven to 200\u00b0 C (400\u00b0 F - gas 6), and 10 minutes before you want to bake it, push your fingers into the dough to make some dimples.
| Sprinkle the dough with the onions, salt, black pepper and olive oil and leave to prove for 10 minutes.
| Bake for 20-25 minutes until golden and leave to cool on a wire rack.
===Variations===
Add herbs, spices etc of your choice.
===Chef's notes===
In theory you should use lukewarm water, but I made this with sparkling mineral water straight from the fridge.  It takes a lot longer to prove, but a longer fermentation makes a better bread.
