The Judge 

This recipe is designed for making in bread machines.  I have a Panasonic with an Italian bread programme.  However, you should refer to the instructions for your own machine.

===Ingredients===
| ¾ teaspoon easy bake yeast
| 400 g strong white flour
| 1 teaspoon sugar
| 2 tablespoons olive oil
| ½ teaspoon salt
| 1 tablespoon dried oregano or 1 tablespoon fresh oregano, finely chopped
| 50 g black olives, chopped
| 280 ml water - or by weight instead of volume, 280 g water
===Method===


| Put the ingredients in your bread maker in the order specified in your manufacturer's instructions.
| Set at 'Italian' programme or refer to your user's manual. 
| Panasonic SD253 breadmaker, use the Italian bake setting
| Panasonic SD-ZB2502 automatic breadmaker, use  menu option 09, Italian bake
Allow to cool on a cake rack before cutting.
===Serving suggestions===
Good with soup or a chunk of Gorgonzola.
===Variations===
I used half green and half black olives, due to laziness on my part.  I only had black olives with stones in and became fed up with pitting them.
===Chef's notes===
With the Panasonic SD 255, the whole process takes about 4½ hours, but I suspect that other machines make take less time.
