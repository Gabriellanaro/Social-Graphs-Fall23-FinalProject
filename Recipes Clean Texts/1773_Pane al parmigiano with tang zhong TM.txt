===Description===


A wheat and rye bread recipe from Italy, with added Parmesan cheese and made using the tang zhong method.  This has been adapted for Thermomix.
===Ingredients===

| 30g white bread flour
| 150g water
| 7g sachet dried fast action yeast
| A further 270g of white bread flour
| 200g rye flour
| 100g Parmesan, grated 
| 9g salt
| A further 225g water
| Extra Parmesan, grated
| Polenta

===Method===


| Put the 30g flour and 150g water into the bowl '''5 minutes / 65\u00b0C / Speed 4''', reducing to '''Speed 2''' after 2 minutes.
| Leave to cool to room temperature.
| Add the yeast, flours, grated Parmesan, salt and the 225g water to the bowl '''20 secs / Speed 4'''.
| Then '''4 minutes / Knead'''.
| Shape into a ball and place in a lightly oiled bowl.
| Cover and leave to rise in the fridge - this could be overnight or for several hours.
| Remove the dough from the fridge and bring up to room temperature.
| Shape and place in either a 1kg loaf tin or banneton which has been greased and lightly coated with polenta.
| Cover the tin or banneton with oiled cling film and leave to prove.
| Pre-heat the oven to 190\u00b0 C (375\u00b0 F - gas 5), [fan oven 170\u00b0 C ].
| If using a banneton, carefully invert the dough onto a baking tray or stone, which has been sprinkled with more polenta.
| Sprinkle the dough with grated Parmesan and bake for xx minutes.
| Turn out of the tine or remove from the baking tray and leave to cool thoroughly before slicing
===Chef's notes===
You can use coarse semolina instead of polenta. Do not exceed 9g salt because the Parmesan is salty in itself.
