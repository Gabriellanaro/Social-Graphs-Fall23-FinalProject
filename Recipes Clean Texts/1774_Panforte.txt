===Description===

Panforte is a traditional spiced cake from Siena in Tuscany, which is often consumed at Christmas and other special occasions.  It comes in two varieties:

Dark - the top is coated in spices and contains candied melon

White - the top is sprinkled with sugar

The white sort is often called 'Panforte Margherita' and was so named in honour of the visit to Siena of Queen Margherita of Savoy in 1879.  It is this variety which is most commonly seen today and is the subject of this recipe.
===Ingredients===

| 50g clear honey, preferably Italian wildflower (millefiori)
| 230g muscovado sugar
| 140g plain flour
| 230g whole almonds, unpeeled
| 350g candied peel
| 3 oranges, zest only, grated
| \u00bd teaspoon ground cinnamon
| \u00bc teaspoon ground nutmeg
| \u00bc teaspoon ground cloves
| \u00bc teaspoon ground black pepper
| 70ml water
| Rice paper, for lining the bottom of the cake tin
| icing sugar for dusting
===Mise en place===

* Pre-heat the oven to  170\u00b0 C (gas 3), [fan oven 150\u00b0 C]

===Method===


| Lin the base of a 20cm / 8in cake tin with rice paper.
| Line the sides with greaseproof paper and grease with butter or groundnut oil (Vegans) or use Bake-O-Glide.
| In a large pan, melt the honey and sugar over a medium heat - do not allow to burn.
| In a bowl, mix all of the remaining ingredients, except the water and icing sugar.
| Once the mixture in the saucepan is bubbling, stir in the fruit mixture and the water.
| Carry on cooking until the mixture takes on a slightly sticky texture.
| Pour into the cake tin and bake for about 35 minutes.
| Allow to cool and dust with sifted icing sugar.
===Serving suggestions===
Cut into wedges and serve as it is, with tea or coffee.  It can also be served instead of Christmas cake or pudding, in which case, a dollop of Chantilly cream would be lovely.
