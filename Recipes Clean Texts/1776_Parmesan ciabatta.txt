This Italian bread is made using two doughs.  The mixing and first rising are done in a Panasonic breadmaker.  The second rising and baking are not.  Start the day before you want to eat the bread

===Ingredients===
|'''1st dough'''
| 1/8 teaspoon easy-bake dried yeast
| 125g strong white bread flour
| 105ml water
===Ingredients===NB
|'''2nd dough'''
| 1/2 a teaspoon easy-bake dried yeast
| 125g strong white bread flour
| 115g plain flour
| 50g Parmesan cheese (grated)
| 1/2 a teaspoon of salt 
| 1 tablespoon olive oil
| 30ml milk
| 150ml water
| 1 tablespoon sea salt (optional)
===Method===


| Add the ingredients for the first dough to the breadmaker pan in the order in which they are given.
| For Panasonic SD253 and most breadmakers, set to 'Basic Dough'. 
| For the Panasonic SD-ZB2502 automatic breadmaker set to menu option 16, basic dough.
| When when the cycle has finished, switch off the machine and leave to rest at room temperature for about 18 hours.
| Add the ingredients for the second dough to first dough in the breadmaker pan in the order in which they are given.
| Set to 'French Dough' Panasonic SD-ZB2502: option 21 - 3 hours 35 mins.
| The dough should be quite sticky when finished.
| Turn out onto a lightly floured pastry mat or board and cut the dough into two.
| Shape each piece into oblongs of about 25cm each on baking trays or stones, which have been dusted with flour or semolina.
| Cover with a damp tea-towel and leave to rise in a warm place until the dough has doubled in size.
| Sprinkle each loaf with sea salt if desired.
| Preheat the oven to 220\u00b0 C (425\u00b0 F - gas 7) and keep it hot for one hour before baking.
| Bake the bread for about 20 minutes until golden brown.
===Variations===
