Maybe ok for Elvis; not for me.

Isn't this what Elvis used to eat, with his burgers? - Less of the Parmesan I guess.  Anyway, Elvis or not, this is a great way to jazz-up a pretty ordinary vegetable.

===Ingredients===
| 1 kg (2.24 lb) Turnip tops, trimmed
| 50 g (2 oz) butter
| 40 g (1.5 oz) freshly grated Parmesan cheese
| Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
===Method===


| In salted boiling water, cook the turnip tops for 10 minutes, then drain well.
| Melt the butter in the same pan and add the turnip tops back.
| Cook for a further 4 minutes on a high heat, stirring often.
| Season with salt and pepper.
| Arrange on a warm serving dish, sprinkle with Parmesan and serve.
===Variations===

This recipe works equally well with curly kale.
