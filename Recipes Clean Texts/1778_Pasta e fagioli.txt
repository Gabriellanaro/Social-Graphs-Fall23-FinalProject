Pasta e fagioli, meaning \"pasta and beans\", is a traditional meatless Italian dish. Like many other Italian favorites including pizza and polenta, the dish started as a peasant dish, being composed of inexpensive ingredients. Today it can be widely found, even in restaurants that do not specialize in Italian cuisine. It is often pronounced ''pasta fazool'' in the United States.

| 2 carrots, sliced
| 3 celery stalks chopped into moons
| 1 can tomatoes, chopped
| 1 can of good quality vegetable soup or 225 ml vegetable stock
| Â½ teaspoon oregano
| Pinch of dried thyme
| 1 bay leaf
| Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
| 180 g small pasta, such as elbow macaroni
| 1 can cannellini beans, rinsed and drained
===Method===


| Heat the oil over a medium heat and add a good grind of black pepper.
| Add the onions, garlic, celery, carrots and saut\u00e9 the for about 6 minutes, stirring now and then.
