===Description===

Another recipe from British Onions.

===Ingredients===
| 500g Strong white bread flour
| Â½ pint tepid water
| 1 teaspoon easy yeast or 1 sachet of yeast
| 1 teaspoon salt
| 1 teaspoon golden caster sugar
| 2 tablespoons olive oil
| 8 tablespoons pizza sauce or passata
| 1 red onions, sliced into 5mm rings
| 1 pear sliced into 20 mm slices
| 150g gorgonzola cheese, chopped into pieces
| 4 tablespoons walnuts, chopped
| 25g rocket leaves
| Olive oil to serve
===Method===


| Put the yeast in a bowl, with the sugar and cover with the warm water. 
| Leave this to the side for 5 minutes. 
| In a bowl (or even better, a mixer or bread maker), add the flour, yeast and sugar solution, salt and olive oil.
| Mix together to form a soft dough. 
| If doing by hand turn the bread out onto a floured surface, then with a firm fist, knead the bread, for 10 minutes. 
| Place the dough in a large clean mixing bowl, which has had a dribble of oil wiped over it. 
| Cover with some oiled cling film and leave in a warm place such as an airing cupboard or near a warm cooker for 1 hour. 
| When you come back to it, the dough will have doubled in size. 
| Remove the cling film and stick your fist into the dough. It will knock all the air out of it. 
| Knock the dough around for a minute or until it has deflated. It is now ready to shape.
| Heat an oven to 200C. 
| Cut the dough into 4 then roll out each piece into a flat thin round pizza base.
| Prick the pizza all over with a fork. This prevents it puffing up too much and burning while it is cooking.
| Top each pizza with 2 tablespoons of tomato sauce, some onions rings, pear slices, some Gorgonzola, 1 tablespoon of walnuts. 
| Lay the pizzas on baking trays and bake in the oven for 15-20 minutes. You want to base to be golden and crispy and the cheese to be melted and gooey.
| When they have finished cook top with a handful of rocket and a drizzle of olive oil and serve.
