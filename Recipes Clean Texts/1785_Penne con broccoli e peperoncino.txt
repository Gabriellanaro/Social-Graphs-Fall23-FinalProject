Penne with broccoli and chilli.

===Ingredients===
| 400g penne
| 450g small broccoli florets
| 2 tablespoons olive oil
| Garlic to taste, crushed (I use 2 bulbs)
| 1Â½ teaspoons bird's eye chilli paste
| 60ml Greek-style yogurt
| Seasoning
| 25g Parmesan cheese, grated
| 2-3 tablespoons pine nuts, toasted
===Method===


| Heat some lightly salted water in a large pan until it boils.
| Add the pasta and place a steaming basket or colander containing the broccoli over the top.
| Cover, bring to the boil and cook for 8-10 minutes until the penne is al dente and the broccoli tender.
| Heat the oil in a small frying pan and saut\u00e9 the garlic for 2-3 minutes, stirring in the bird's eye chilli paste and yogurt about 30 seconds before the end of the cooking time.
| Drain the pasta and place in a warm serving dish with the broccoli.
| Season lightly, then add the garlic / chilli mixture and toss gently.
| Sprinkle the Parmesan cheese and pine nuts over the top.
| Serve immediately.
===Variations===
Replace the pine nuts with cashew nuts.  Use fresh chillies instead of bird's eye chilli paste.
