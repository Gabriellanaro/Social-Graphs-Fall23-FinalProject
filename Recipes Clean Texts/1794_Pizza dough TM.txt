===Description===

A quick pizza dough recipe for the Thermomix

===Ingredients===TM
| 200g water
| 50g extra virgin olive oil
| 20g fresh yeast or 1 sachet dried yeast
| 400g strong flour
| 1 teaspoon salt


===Mise en place===
* Preheat the oven to 250\u00b0 C (475\u00b0 F - gas 9)
===Method===


| Pour the liquids into the bowl '''1 minute / 37\u00b0 / Speed 4'''
| Add the yeast and mix '''5 seconds / Speed 4'''
| Next, add the flour and salt '''1 minute / Speed Dough'''
| Remove the dough from the bowl with oiled hands and spread it out in a greased baking tray.
| Stretch it with your hand until it is very thin - you can leave the dough to rest until double its volume (approximately 30 minutes)
| Put your chosen ingredients onto it (tomato sauce, mozzarella etc.)
| Bake for about 20 minutes
===Recipe source===
* This is a translation of a recipe in '''''Thermomix TM31 - Imprescindible para tu cocina''''' which is the book supplied with Spanish TMXs.
===Chef's notes===
I made this today using 00 pizza flour and it has a lovely texture.  I divided the dough into 3 and froze each piece separately.  Before stretching the dough, I shape into a ball and leave to rise slowly overnight in an oiled bowl in the fridge.
