The basic cheese and tomato pizza.  I have made this using Chef's marvellous idea for using a slab of granite as a pizza stone, but instructions are also given for making it in the oven.

===Ingredients===
| Half quantity of pizza dough
| Garlic, peeled and chopped, to taste
| Olive oil
| 1 x 400 g tin of chopped tomatoes
| 1 tablespoon tomato pur\u00e9e
| Basil or other herbs, chopped, to taste
| Polenta (for granite method)
| 250 g Mozzarella cheese, chopped or sliced
| Black olives


===Mise en place===
*Roll thinly and shape the pizza dough, place onto a baking sheet and leave to rise until double its size.
*If using the oven, preheat it to 220\u00b0 C (425\u00b0 F - gas 7)
===Method===


| Using a saucepan, lightly fry the garlic in a little oil.
| Add the tomatoes, tomato pur\u00e9e and herbs.
| Bring to the boil and allow the mixture to reduce until it is thick.
| If using the oven, spread the tomato mixture over the top of the dough, together with the cheese and olives and bake for about 15-20 minutes.
| If using the granite pizza stone, preheat the grill with the stone about 5-8 cm underneath it.  You can use baking tins or other heatproof objects to keep it at the correct height.
| Sprinkle some polenta on the hot granite, to prevent the pizza from sticking.
| Carefully transfer the dough to the granite and grill for a minute or two on either side.
| Quickly spread the tomato mixture, cheese and olives over the top and grill until the cheese has melted.
===Serving suggestions===
Serve with a nice. crisp, green salad and bread.
===Variations===
You can use a mixture of cheeses, so long as they melt properly.  Try sprinkling some Parmesan over the Mozzarella.  Fry some chillies with garlic before adding the tomatoes.
===Chef's notes===
Please don't do what I did and place the granite on top of the grill pan.  I tried to lift it from under the grill and the weight of the granite broke the grill handle off.
