===Serving suggestions===
Serve piping hot.

Pizzoccheri pairs well with a full bodied local red wine: [http://www.wineloverspage.com/italwineguide/valtellina05.phtml Valtellina Superiore]
===Variations===
* If you do not find Valtellina Casera cheese, you can try with Bitto, Fontina, Cheddar or all Parmigiano Reggiano cheese instead
* If you do not want to make the pasta, you can buy it already made
* When you fry the garlic you can add sage as well
* Make sure to have a little bit of cheese left for the last layer and put it in a hot (~200 \u00b0C) oven for 5 minutes before serving
