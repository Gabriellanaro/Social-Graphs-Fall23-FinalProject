Chicken with rosemary, garlic and tomato sauce from Le Marche region of Italy.  Unusually the tomato sauce is made with tomato pur\u00e9e and not actual tomatoes.

'''For the chicken:'''
===Ingredients===
| 1 chicken cut into 10 pieces (see Chef's notes below)
| sea salt
| Freshly ground white pepper
| 5 sprigs rosemary
| 60-120ml olive oil
| 1 medium onion, finely chopped
| Garlic to taste, finely diced
| 960ml dry white wine
| 125ml chicken stock
'''For the sauce:'''
===Ingredients===NB
| 3 tablespoons olive oil
| 1 medium onion, finely diced
| 1 large carrot, finely diced
| 1 stick of celery, finely diced
| Garlic to taste, crushed or finely chopped
| 90g tomato pur\u00e9e
| 430ml chicken stock
| ½ teaspoon dried or 1½ teaspoons fresh oregano
| ½ teaspoon dried or 1½ teaspoon fresh thyme
| Seasoning


===Mise en place===
* Season the chicken pieces and place them in an airtight container or bag, with the rosmary.  
* Refrigerate for at least 6 hours or overnight.  
* Bring the chicken to room temperature before use, reserving the rosemary - about 30 minutes.
===Method===

'''To make the sauce'''

| Heat the oil in a pan over a medium high heat.
| Add the onion, carrot and celery and saut\u00e9 for about 10 minutes.
| Add the garlic and cook for a further couple of minutes, but do not allow it to burn.
| Add the tomato pur\u00e9e and cook, stirring, for about 4 minutes.
| Gradually stir in the chicken stock and bring to a simmer.
| Reduce the heat and allow to simmer gently, partially covered for 30 minutes.
| 10 minutes before the end, season to taste and stir in the herbs.
| When cooked, remove from the heat and allow to stand for a further 10 minutes.
'''To cook the chicken'''

| Heat 60ml of the oil in a large, deep pan over a medium-high heat.
| Sear the chicken for 4-5 minutes on each side, in two batches, or until golden brown.
| Transfer the chicken to a plate.
| Add the onion and garlic and saut\u00e9 for a further 3 minutes.
| Pour in the tomato sauce and stir continuously for 2 minutes.
| Add the wine and chicken stock, reducing the heat to low and return the chicken to the pan.
| Cook for about 40 minutes, partially covered.
| Add the rosemary and cook for a further 20 minutes or until the chicken is done.
| Discard the rosemary before serving.
===Serving suggestions===
Serve with ciabatta.
===Variations===
Another time I might try this with pheasant and cider, rather than chicken and wine.
===Chef's notes===
Cut the chicken into 2 legs, 2 thighs, 2 wings and 2 breasts cut in half.

For this recipe I used 1½ bulbs of garlic for the sauce and 2 bulbs for the chicken - you may feel you want to reduce the quantity.
