===Serving suggestions===
Serve with a green vegetable like broccoli or peas
===Variations===
Use creme fraiche instead of single Cream (it will be less likely to separate while cooking. Mix the creme fraiche  with  milk to make if pourable.

Use large frozen prawns that have been defrosted, chopped into four pieces.

Sprinkle a few tablespoons of finely grated Parmesan cheese over the top before it is baked.
