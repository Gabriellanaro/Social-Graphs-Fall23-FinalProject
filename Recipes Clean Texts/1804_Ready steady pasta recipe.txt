===Description===

This was one of those Ready Steady Cook moments and the result was rather good so I thought I would add it here so it can be reproduced easily.

===Ingredients===

| 2 tablespoons olive oil
| Freshly ground black pepper
| 1 medium leek
| 350 g box of field mushrooms
| 5cm (2\") chorizo sausage
| 1 medium chicken breast
| 3 cloves of garlic, peeled and sliced (or to taste)
| 2 tablespoons of cream sherry
| 150 ml single cream
| Zest and juice of half a lemon
| 300 g fresh pasta of choice
===Mise en place===
* Slice the chorizo thinly
* Cut the chicken into thin bite-sized pieces - nice and thin means they will cook quickly
* Cut each mushroom onto about 3 slices

===Method===

| Heat the oil in a wok or a frying pan, add a good grind of pepper and tip in the leeks
| Gentry saut\u00e9 the leeks for 3 minutes - don't let them take on any colour
| Turn the heat up add add the mushrooms and stir-fry them until they start to release a little water
| Add the chorizo and stir-fry for for 2 minutes
| Mix in the chicken pieces and the sliced garlic and cook until the chicken is done and not pink when cut.  
| Now is a good time to start the broccoli and the pasta - add the pasta to fast boiling water and boil for about 4 minutes.  Dried pasta will take longer.  The broccoli should be steamed for about the same time depending upon how well cooked you like it.
| This should only take 3 or 4 minutes if the chicken is cut thinly enough.
| Add the sherry the zest and juice from half a lemon and stir well to de-glaze the pan.
| Remove from the heat and pour in the cream and mix really well to combine.
| Pour over the cooked pasta.
