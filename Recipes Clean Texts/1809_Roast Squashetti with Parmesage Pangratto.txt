===Description===

Organic spaghetti squash is uncannily like a pack of spaghetti in a veg. Marvellous with an Italian Job lot of toasted breadcrumbs.

===Ingredients===
| 1 spaghetti squash
| sea salt and freshly ground pepper
| 3 garlic cloves
| A gloss of olive oil and/or a couple of blobs of butter
| \u00bd mug of breadcrumbs
| 12 sage leaves
| A large handful of freshly grated Parmesan
===Mise en place===
* Preheat the oven to 200\u00b0 C (400\u00b0 F - gas 6), [fan oven 180\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]

===Method===

| Halve your squash lengthwise, giving you two identical halves. Place on a baking tray or in individual baking dishes. Dust with a little salt and pepper.
| Flatten two garlic cloves with the side of a knife or your hand. Keep the peel on to protect the clove from burning. Pop a clove in each squash halve. Gloss with oil.
| Roast for 45 mins to 1 hour, or till fully tender and bronzed around the edges. Let the oven cook as much water from the squash as possible, for intensely-flavoured flesh.
| While your squash roasts, add a blob of butter or a gloss of oil to a pan. Add the 6 whole sage leaves. Sizzle them in the oil or butter till just crisp on both sides this only takes a minute. Remove from the pan. Use these as a garnish. Put your pan back on the heat.
| Finely chop the last 6 sage leaves and garlic clove. Mix into your breadcrumbs. Add a little more oil or butter to your warming pan. Toss in the breadcrumbs. Sizzle over medium heat till golden and fragrant.
| Once the squash is done, remove the garlic from its skin. Pop it back in the squash. Take a fork to your squash to tease out the spaghetti-like strands, mixing the roasted garlic through. Scatter the toasted crumbs over, along with a good handful of parmesan.
| Dot your crispy sage leaves on top and grab a fork.
