After making Quattro formaggi (four cheese) pizza, this was so good it deserves to a pizza of its own.  Any blue cheese would work, I just happen to love St Agur, it is a little less salty than some and tastes creamy, even when melted.  Very nice.

===Ingredients===
| Olive oil
| 1 portion of pizza dough - makes 2 pizzas
| 150 g Saint Agur Blue cheese, crumbled
| 6 tablespoons of crushed walnuts


===Mise en place===
* If using a pizza stone, preheat the pizza stone under a very hot grill for about 20 minutes.  Place it about 8cm (3\") from the heat source.

===Method===


| Make 1 pizza per person.
| Dust your work surface with fine yellow cornmeal.
| Divide the pizza dough into two and roll out into two thin 25.5 cm (10 inch) pizzas.
| Prick the pizza all over with a fork. This prevents it puffing up too much and burning while it is cooking.
| Place the pizza dough on a pizza peel that has been dusted with fine yellow cornmeal.
| Preheat the pizza stone under a very hot grill.
| With a deft move, slide the pizza dough from the pizza peel, on to the preheated pizza stone.
| Cook for about 2 minutes on one side only, until lightly browned.
| Remove from the oven.
| Drizzle the top of the pizza with a little olive oil.
| Arrange the walnuts over the pizza and top with the crumbled blue cheese.
| Bake the pizza until the cheese starts to melt and bubble-this only takes a few minutes under a very hot grill.
| Keep the fist pizza warm at the bottom of the oven whilst you make the second.
===Serving suggestions===
Serve with homemade cole-slaw

Blue cheese and walnuts go really well together, putting them on a pizza is just genius.
