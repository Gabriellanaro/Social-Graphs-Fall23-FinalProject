'''Rouladen''' (or '''Rinderroulade''') is a German /Hungarian meat roulade consisting of bacon, onions, mustard and pickles wrapped in thinly sliced beef and then cooked.

The Italian versions  are called '''Braciole''' or '''Involtini''' (nothern Italy) and commonly have equal measures of pine nuts, small seedless raisins, Mozzarella cheese, Prosciutto, breadcrumbs and a little chopped parsley and salt and pepper.  They are pan fried and sometimes served with Sunday sauce.

Beef, venison, wild boar or pork can be used, though in this recipe we use beef.
