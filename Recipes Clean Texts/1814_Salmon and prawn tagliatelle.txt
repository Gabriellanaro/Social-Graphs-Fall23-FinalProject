I must have made this 100's of times, and it never fails to amaze.  Simplicity itself and so good.

[[Image:RecipeSalmon and prawn tagliatelle.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The ingredients without pasta]]
I saw this recipe on The Big Breakfast (Channel 4), about 25 years ago; and have been making variations of it ever since.

It's the simplest recipe I know - I dare you to get this one wrong!

There is an even simpler version here

This is especially nice if made with homemade pasta

===Ingredients===
| 1 portion of fresh tagliatelle (about 250g) or 100g  of dried taglitelle
| 1 tin lobster bisque soup
| 2 raw salmon steaks, about 175g (6 oz) each
| 100 g (3.5 oz) fresh peeled prawns
| 3 tablespoons dry sherry
| 125 ml single or double cream
| Big handful of parsley, chopped - keep some whole for the garnish
| Chopped chives (optional)
| Squeeze of lemon juice
| Freshly grated black pepper
| Pinch of salt
| Splash of olive oil
| 2 cloves of garlic, peeled and crushed
===Method===


| Remove the skin from the salmon and remove any pin-bones - tweezers are good for this
| Cut the salmon into 1\" x 1\" chunks
| Add a splash of olive oil and the black pepper to a large pan and sizzle the garlic for a few minutes. Add the salmon pieces and stir to coat with the garlic oil
| Pour the soup over the garlic and salmon, almost bring the soup to the boil and then immediately reduce to a simmer
| Place the salmon chunks in the soup and simmer for 4 minutes
| Cook the pasta as directed, drain and cover
| Add the prawns, cream, sherry, chopped parsley, salt and stir for a minute or so
| Pour the pasta into the soup, mix well, serve with parsley garnish
===Serving suggestions===
Serve hot, maybe with a salad if you need to stretch it to four people.  There is enough here for two gluttons though!

===Variations===
This works well with a few crushed bird's' eye chillies crushed and added with the garlic.  Mind you, if you love your chili you probably don't need to be told this!
