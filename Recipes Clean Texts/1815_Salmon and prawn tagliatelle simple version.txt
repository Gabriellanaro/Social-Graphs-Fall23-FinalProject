===Description===

I saw this on The Big Breakfast (Channel 4), about 15 years ago and have been making a variation of it ever since.

It's the simplest recipe I know - I dare you to get this one wrong!

There is a slightly more complex version here, though it's hardly challenging either.

===Ingredients===
| 1 portion of fresh tagliatelle (about 250g) or 100g  of dried tagliatelle.
| 1 tin lobster bisque soup
| 2 raw salmon steaks, about 175g (6 oz) each
| 100 g (3.5 oz) fresh peeled prawns
===Method===


| Remove the skin from the salmon and remove any pin-bones - tweezers are good for this
| Cut the salmon into 1\" x 1\" chunks (2.5 cm cubes)
| In a large pan, bring the soup almost to the boil and then immediately reduce to a simmer
| Place the salmon chunks in the soup and simmer for 4 minutes
| Cook the pasta as directed, drain and cover
| Add the prawns and stir for a minute or so
| Pour the pasta into the soup, mix well
| Arrange on a serving dish
===Serving suggestions===

Serve hot, maybe with a salad if you need to stretch it to four people.  There is enough here for two gluttons though!
