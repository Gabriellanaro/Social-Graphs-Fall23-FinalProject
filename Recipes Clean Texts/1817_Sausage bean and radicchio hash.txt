In our attempt to to reach our 5 a day target, we're getting a weekly vegetable box from Abel & Cole, which is making us use vegetables that we might not normally use.  The radicchio is a good example of this.  The spicy pork sausages and beans should go well with the bitter leaved radicchio.

===Ingredients===

| 3 cloves of garlic, peeled and crushed
| 2 red onions, peeled and sliced
| 2 tablespoons of Olive oil
| Splash of red wine (optional)
| 1 x 200g Mattessons smoked pork horseshoe sausage, sliced on the diagonal
| 1 x 225g (8 oz) hot chorizo sausage, sliced
| 1 x 400g can of cannellini beans, rinsed well and drained
| 1 x 400g can of flageolet beans, rinsed well and drained
| 2 x 400g tinned tomatoes
| 1 tablespoon tomato puree
| 300 ml (1/2 pint) chicken stock
| pinch of chilli flakes
| pinch of mixed herbs
| 1 tablespoon tomato puree
| sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
| 1 450 g (1 lb) radicchio, cored and shredded

===Method===


| Heat the olive oil in a heavy based pan and add a good pinch of black pepper
| Gently saute the onions for 5 minutes, add the garlic for the last 2 minutes.  Don't let the garlic burn
| Deglaze the pan with the red wine, if using.
| Add the chorizo sausage and fry for 3 minutes, turning often
| Add the horseshoe sausage and fry until browned.
| Tip in the beans, tinned tomatoes, tomato puree, chicken stock and the chilli flakes, mixed herbs and stir well, bring to the boil, reduce the heat and simmer for 45 minutes
| After 45 minutes, add the sliced radicchio, cover and simmer for a further 30 minutes.
| Check for seasoning and serve.
===Serving suggestions===
Serve with crusty bread or a bread roll to dip into the sauce.

Pasta, rice or boiled potatoes would be nice, but remember that this is very filling and a little goes a long way.
===Variations===
Use any variety of cabbageand any variety of canned beans. Reconstituted dried beans would be great providing you leave time to rehydrate them.

I added a sliced up courgette 30 minutes before the end, as we had one spare.
