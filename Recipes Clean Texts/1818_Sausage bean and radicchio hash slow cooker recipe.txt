===Description===

This is a very hearty and filling cassoulet and perfectly suited to slow cooking.

===Ingredients===

| 3 cloves of garlic, peeled and crushed
| 2 red onions, peeled and sliced
| 2 tablespoons of Olive oil
| Splash of red wine (optional)
| 1 Mattessons smoked pork horseshoe sausage, sliced on the diagonal
| 1 225g (8 oz) hot chorizo sausage, sliced
| 1 400g can of cannellini beans, rinsed well and drained
| 1 400g can of flageolet beans, rinsed well and drained
| 2 400g tinned tomatoes
| 1 tablespoon tomato puree
| 300 ml (1/2 pint) chicken stock
| Pinch of chilli flakes
| Pinch of mixed herbs
| 1 tablespoon tomato puree
| sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
| 450 g (1 lb) radicchio, cored and shredded

===Method===


| Heat the olive oil in a heavy based pan and add a good pinch of black pepper
| Gently saute the onions for 5 minutes, add the garlic for the last 2 minutes.  Don't let the garlic burn
| Deglaze the pan with the red wine, if using.
| Reserve the onions and garlic to the slow cooker and add the chorizo sausage and fry for 3 minutes, turning often
| Add the horseshoe sausage and fry until browned.
| Add the cooked sausages to the slow cooker
| Tip in the beans, tinned tomatoes, tomato puree, chicken stock and the chilli flakes, mixed herbs and stir well.
| Add the sliced radicchio, cover and cook on low for 4 hours
| Check for seasoning and serve.
===Variations===
Use any variety of cabbageand any variety of canned beans. Reconstituted dried beans would be great providing you leave time to rehydrate them.

I added a sliced up courgette 30 minutes before the end, as we had one spare.
===Chef's notes===
If you like your cabbage with a little bite, and time allows, add the cabbage during the last 30 minutes of cooking.
