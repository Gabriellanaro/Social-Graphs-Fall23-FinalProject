Recipe created by Natural Chef, Ceri Jones and reproduced on Cookipedia by courtesy of debbie&andrew's sausages.
===Ingredients===

| 2 teaspoons olive oil
| 2 cloves garlic, minced 
| 1 teaspoon fennel seeds
| \u00bd teaspoon dried chilli flakes 
| 4 debbie&andrew\u0092s Harrogate 97% Pork Sausages, chopped 
| 10 cherry tomatoes, quartered 
| 2 large courgettes, julienned (reserve the cores, dice them and add to the sauce)
| 25g fresh rocket, black pepper and Parmesan cheese to serve

===Method===


| Heat the olive oil in a large frying pan. Add the garlic, chilli flakes, and fennel seeds and fry for 30 seconds before adding the raw chopped sausage.
| Cook till the mixture starts to brown.
| Next add the diced courgette cores along with the tomatoes and cook over a medium heat until the sausages are cooked through, approximately a further 7-8 minutes
| When the sausages are cooked add the julienned courgette and stir through the sauce. Let the courgettes warm in the sauce for 2-3 minutes until softened.
| Plate up and dress with fresh rocket, a good dose of black pepper and a shaving of Parmesan cheese.
===Serving suggestions===
Plate up and dress with fresh rocket, a good dose of black pepper and a shaving of Parmesan cheese.
===Chef's notes===
You can use a julienne peeler or spiralizer to create your courgette spaghetti. If you have neither, use a standard peeler to create wider ribbons of courgette instead. Depending on your method there may or may not be any courgette cores for the sauce.
