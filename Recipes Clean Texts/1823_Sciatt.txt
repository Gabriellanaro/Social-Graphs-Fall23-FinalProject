Jerry, aka Chef

Sciatt is a dish typical of Valtellina, Italy. In the local Valtellina dialect it means toad (becaue it is ugly).

Sciatt are round crispy dough balls made of buckwheat with a heart of melted cheese, served on a bed of chicory.  The cheese is usually Bitto Valtellina cheese.  Fontina cheese makes a good substitute.

===Ingredients===
| 100 g buckwheat flour
| 175 ml Castello Red beer
| 20 ml grappa
| 500 g fontina cheese or bitto cheese, cut into 2 cm cubes
| Plain flour for dusting
| Salt and freshly ground black pepper
| Sunflower oil for deep frying
===Method===


| Add the buckwheat flour to a bowl
| Add the grappa
| Gradually add the beer whilst whisking until you have a smooth thick batter with the consistency of thick whipped cream
| Cover and rest for 1 hour at room temperature
| Season the flour with salt and pepper
| Heat the oil to 180\u00b0 C (350\u00b0 F)
| In small batches, roll each piece of cheese in seasoned flour, dip into the batter and deep fry for about 2 minutes until they are crisp on the outside
| Drain on kitchen paper
===Serving suggestions===
Serve on a bed of finely sliced raddichio
===Variations===
Use Peroni Red beer or any lager as a substitute for Castello
