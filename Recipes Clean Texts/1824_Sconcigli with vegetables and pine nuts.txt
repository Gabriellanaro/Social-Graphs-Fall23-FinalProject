===Description===

Sconcigli is a pasta shape resembling a spiral seashell and this this recipe it is baked after being boiled.
[[Image:Sconcigli.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Sconcigli]]

===Ingredients===
| 100g sconcigli
| A little olive oil
| 1 small onion, finely sliced
| 1 stick of celery, sliced
| 1 medium yellow or green pepper
| Garlic to taste, finely diced
| 40 g pine nuts
| 1 tin chopped tomatoes
| 100 g sweetcorn
| 100 g spring greens, shredded
| 1 teaspoon dried oregano
| Seasoning
| 100g of mixed cheese, eg Parmesan, Grana Padano, Fontina, grated


===Mise en place===
* Preheat the oven to 200\u00b0 C (400\u00b0 F - gas 6)
===Method===


| Boil the sconcigli for about 12-15 minutes in plenty of salted, boiling water.
| When cooked, drain and run onder a cold tap. 
| Meanwhile, heat some olive oil in a pan and add the onion, celery stick and pepper.
| Cook over a medium heat until the vegetable begin to soften.
| Add the garlic and the pine nuts and fry for a further minute or two.
| Stir in the tomatoes, sweetcorn, spring greens and oregano.
| Bring to the boil, reduce heat and simmer gently for 5 minutes.
| Season to taste - under rather than over as the cheese will be salty.
| Stir in the pasta and mix well.
| Pour into a greased baking dish and sprinkle the cheese over the top.
| Bake for about 25 minutes.
===Variations===
Use any combination for vegetables, but keep the onion, garlic and tomatoes.

I like to use vegetable stock to boil pasta for this type of recipe.
