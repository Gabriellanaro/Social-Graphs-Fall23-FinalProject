===Description===

Armed with a stack of venison burgers from Preston family butchers - East Kent, I thought I would see what I could knock up with what was lying around in the kitchen.

These came up winners.  The burgers were topped with blue cheese (or mature cheddar), cooked on a bed of crispy garlic new potatoes, with a few tomatoes on the side as a nod to healthy eating.
===Ingredients===

| 4 x 100 g venison burger patties (or meat of your choice)
| 450 g new potatoes
| 4 fat bulbs of garlic, peeled and crushed
| 2 tablespoons olive oil
| 2 tablespoons of blue cheese or mature cheddar
| sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
| Tomatoes to garnish
===Mise en place===

* Preheat the oven to 180\u00b0 C (350\u00b0 F - gas 4), [fan oven 160\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]

===Method===


| Wash the new potatoes, don't peel them
| Halve them and steam or boil for about 20 minutes until soft, but not disintegrating
| Add 2 tablespoons of olive oil to be base of a small oven tray
| Distribute half of the crushed garlic over the olive oil and season with salt and pepper
| Add the cooked new potatoes on crush roughly with a fork
| Sprinkle the remaining garlic over the potatoes and season again.
| Lay the venison burgers over the crushed potatoes and bake for about 30 minutes at the top of the oven, turning once after 15 minutes
| After 30 minutes, top the burgers with blue cheese and grill until the cheese is bubbling
