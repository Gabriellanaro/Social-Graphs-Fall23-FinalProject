===Description===

A no-dough pizza using sliced sourdough bread and goodies from the fridge.  This made a brilliant meal.

I thought I would make a pizza using a sourdough loaf instead of dough.  This was fantastic and will be made again and again.

Each pizza was made in a non-stick 20cm x 5cm flan flan tin which is deep enough to hold all that lovely runny cheese.

Don't completely fill the base with bread or it will remain quite wet - you need to leave some space around so it can get crispy.

Use whatever ingredients you fancy - salami worked well as the flavours run into the bread.  Though it sounds odd, the slices of lemon tempered the fatty meat and the cheese.

===Ingredients===

| 6 thick slices of white sourdough bread - crusts left on
| 2 balls of mozzarella cheese, drained and torn into pieces
| 150g sliced meat such as salami
| 4 very thick slices of lemon, skin on but pips removed
| 1 red pepper from a bottle of jarred roasted red peppers, chopped into small pieces
| Lots of freshly torn basil leaves - almost Â¾ of the plant pictures went into the 2 pizzas
| Freshly ground black pepper
| Lots of extra virgin olive oil
===Mise en place===

* Preheat your oven to 200\u00b0 C (400\u00b0 F - gas 6), [fan oven 180\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]

===Method===


| Lightly oil the base of the pie / flan dishes
| Place 3 slices of sourdough bread in each tin
| Drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle with black pepper
| Layer the sliced meat, chopped red pepper and torn mozzarella to fill the tin, finding places to bury the lemon slices
| Drizzle with olive oil
| Bake for 15 minutes in the middle of the oven set to 200\u00b0 C (400\u00b0 F - gas 6)
