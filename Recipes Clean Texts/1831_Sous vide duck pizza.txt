===Description===

Any excuse to use my homemade homemade sous vide sous vide cooker because it makes meat so tender.  duck is a great candidate for this as I find sometimes if it's cooked rare, it can be a bit chewy.  This has been sous vide  cooked for 3 hours at 56.5\u00b0C (''133.7\u00b0F'').  Seared, skin side only to release excess fat and then allowed to cool and then sliced thinly and added to the pizza. It was a lot of work but it was delicious. 

One 170g duck breast was enough for two pizzas, I sous vide cooked two and froze the unused one for next weeks duck pizza.

I added a teaspoon of hoisin sauce to the vacuum bag as I think it goes so well with duck.  That's a personal taste so I guess it is optional.

===Ingredients===

| 170g duck breast, skin on.
| 1 teaspoon hoisin sauce
| 1 portion pizza dough
| 4 tablespoons of tomato sauce for pizzas
| 250g mozzarella cheese
| sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
| A pinch of dried oregano
| A drizzle of olive oil

===Mise en place===
If using a pizza stone, preheat the pizza stone under a very hot grill for about 20 minutes. Place it about 8cm (3\") from the heat source.

If using the oven, preheat it to 220\u00b0 C (425\u00b0 F - gas 7)

===Method===


| Vacuum seal the duck breast together with 1 teaspoon of hoisin sauce
| Cook in a sous vide bath for 3 hours at 56.5\u00b0C
| Remove from the vacuum bag, discarding the sauce, it will have done its job and flavoured the meat.
| Allow to rest for 10 minutes.
| Heat a frying pan over a medium high flame
| Wipe any sauce from the skin side of the duck breast and sear (skin side only) in the hot pan for 3 minutes without adding any extra oil.
| Allow to cool and slice thinly.  This can all be done way ahead of cooking the pizza.
| Dust your work surface with fine yellow cornmeal
| Divide the pizza dough into two and roll out into two thin 25.5 cm (10 inch) pizzas
| You can leave them in a warm place for an hour or so to rise. I quite like them cooked immediately they are rolled out for a more crispy finish.
| Prick the pizza all over with a fork. This prevents it puffing up too much and burning while it is cooking
| With a deft move, slide the pizza from the pizza peel, on to the preheated pizza stone.
| Cook on one side only for about 2 minutes or until lightly browned.
| Repeat for the other side.
| Remove from the oven and spread the pizza with 2 tablespoons of tomato sauce for pizza.
| Crumble a ball of mozzarella cheese over the pizza and top with the sliced duck.
| Season with salt, pepper a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of oregano.
| Return to the oven and bake until the cheese is nicely melted. This should take about 4 minutes under a grill on a pizza stone, if oven baking, about 15 minutes in the middle of the oven.
| Repeat for the second pizza.
| Keep the first pizza warm at the bottom of the oven whilst you make the second.
