===Description===

An old favourite which was very popular in the UK in the 1960s and 1970s.

===Ingredients===
| 50 ml olive oil
| 2 medium carrots, scraped and finely diced
| 2 celery sticks, finely diced (include the leaves is you have them)
| 2 medium red onions, peeled and coarsely diced
| 4 bulbs of Garlic, (or as much as you like), peeled and finely diced
| 4 tablespoons fresh parsley, finely chopped
| 450 g beef, minced
| 40 g butter
| 2 x 400 g tins chopped tomatoes
| seasoning
| 1 teaspoon sugar
| 400 g spaghetti
| 25g Parmesan cheese, freshly grated (optional)
===Method===


| Heat the oil in a deep saut\u00e9 or frying pan on a high heat.
| When hot, but not smoking, add the carrots, celery, onions, garlic and parsley.
| Reduce the heat to medium and  cook until the onions are soft.
| Add the beef and when brown, add the butter and the tomatoes.
| Cover and simmer for 1 hour.
| Add the sugar and simmer gently for a further 30 minutes.
| Meanwhile, boil up three kettles-full of water and pour into a large saucepan.
| Once the water is boiling, add the spaghetti and cook for 7-8 minutes.  Place a metal colander over the pan containing the spaghetti to warm it up.
| When the spaghetti is cooked, remove the colander and place over ab large bowl or the sink. 
| Drain the pasta and plate it immediately.
| Cover with the sauce and serve, sprinkled with grated Parmesan if desired.

===Serving suggestions===
Great on its own, but decent bread and a crisp salad would make excellent accompaniments for the hungry or greedy.
===Variations===
I don't think that you can vary this recipe too much and still call it 'Spaghetti alla Bolognese'.  The Italians seem to have a different name for each variation!
===Chef's notes===
I think you can use any pasta of the spaghetti type, but do avoid thick, short pasta such as penne, macaroni etc as the sauce is not suited to it.
