===Description===

[[Image:Spaghetti Bolognese simmering.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Simmer for 1 hour]]
The variation comes courtesy of nik & edwina's cookbook.

To quote Nik, ''I think'' - \"After years of experimentation, Nik arrived at this, his favourite way of making spag bol. It's quite a soupy version, with a rich winey flavour\"
This freezes really well, so make the lot and freeze what you don't eat.

===Ingredients===
| 1 kg good quality very lean minced beef, or 500g very lean minced beef and 500g very lean minced pork
| 1 tablespoon of butter
| 1 tablespoon of olive oil
| 1 large onion
| 1 clove garlic or to taste.
| 250g chopped button mushrooms, or 6 finely chopped dried porcini mushrooms or shiitake mushrooms soaked in milk for 20 minutes
| 2.5 tablespoons of plain flour
| 1 ½ tins of tomatoes
| 300mls good red wine
| 200mls beef stock
| 2 tablespoons tomato pur\u00e9e
| 2 tablespoons chopped curly leaf parsley (other herbs can be added)
| Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
===Method===


| Gently fry onions and garlic in oil and butter for 10 minutes until melting
| Add mince slowly, turning and stirring gently until cooked thoroughly, keeping the mixture dry
| Add mushrooms and cook till soft
| Mix in flour and cook through for a minute or so
| Add tomatoes, salt and pepper, ¾ of the parsley and the tomato pur\u00e9e , and stir well. Cook for 3 - 4 minutes. Add wine and beef stock, cover wth a lid and simmer very gently for 60 minutes, checking every now and then to make sure it's not catching. The sauce should still be fairly liquid at the end of cooking
| Serve with spaghetti, more chopped parsley, and Parmesan
===Chef's notes===
The only change I would make to this recipe is to add a bay leaf while simmering and to garnish with plenty of chopped fresh basil.
