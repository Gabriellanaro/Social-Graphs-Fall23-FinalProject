===Description===

Spaghetti with seafood.

===Ingredients===
| 500g total squid and pre cooked and shelled mussels
| 90ml olive oil
| 250ml dry white wine
| 400g tinned tomatoes, liquidised
| Chilli, chopped or bird's eye chilli paste to taste
| Seasoning
| 40g dried porcini mushrooms, soaked and thinly sliced
| 1 small carrot, chopped
| 1 small onion, chopped
| Garlic to taste, finely diced
| 1 tablespoon dried oregano
| 400g spaghetti
===Method===


| Heat half the olive oil and add the squid.
| Brown gently, then increase the heat and add half the wine.
| Allow the wine to reduce, lower the heat and add the tomatoes, chilli and a little salt.
| Simmer until the squid is tender.
| Add the mushrooms and cook for a further 15 minutes.
| Meanwhile, heat the rest of the oil in another pan and fry the onion and carrot until the onion is soft, adding the garlic, a couple of minutes before the end of the cooking time.
| Add the mussels and the remaining wine and cook over a high heat for 5-10 minutes.
| At the same time, boil the spaghetti in salted water, drain and transfer to a warm bowl.
| Mix the squid and mussel mixtures together, season, and pour over the spaghetti.
| Mix well and serve immediately, garnished with the oregano.
===Variations===
You can also include shelled prawns in the mussel mixture.
===Chef's notes===
I don't mess about with shells on fish, so I used some excellent frozen, cooked and shelled mussels.  If you do this, then the cooking time will need to be adjusted accordingly.

I used bird's eye chilli paste and found that a good Â¼ teaspoon per person was about right.  I allowed 1 bulb of garlic per person, but use as much or as little as you like.
