SPAM - Perfect on a pizza
''

Despite its bad name (in food and in email), Spam can be so brilliant on a pizza. It also tastes much less greasy when hot.

===Description===

I just love Spam so this is a must-make. Spam cooks up really well when grilled at a very high heat so is ideal for a Stone baked pizza.

If you really don't like the idea of using Spam, use fresh ham instead.

===Ingredients===
| 1 portion pizza dough - Makes 2 pizzas
| 150 g ball of mozzarella cheese, torn into pieces
| 1 340 g can of Spam original (chopped pork and ham), cut into thin strips.
| Extra virgin olive oil for drizzling
| 1 cup spicy tomato sauce
| Handful of basil leaves, torn
| 1 tablespoon cornmeal


===Mise en place===
* Make the pizza dough as instructed
* If using a pizza stone, preheat the pizza stone under a very hot grill for about 20 minutes.  Place it about 8cm (3\") from the heat source.

===Method===


| Make 1 pizza per person
| Dust the work surface with fine yellow cornmeal
| Stretch or roll the dough into two thin rounds
| Prick the pizza all over with a fork. This prevents it puffing up too much and burning while it is cooking
| Place the pizza dough on a pizza peel that has been dusted with fine yellow cornmeal
| With a deft move, slide the pizza dough from the pizza peel, on to the pizza stone.
| Cook for about 2 minutes on one side only or until lightly browned.
| Remove from the oven, flip over and add the topping.
| Repeat for the second pizza whilst you prepare the first.
| Drizzle the pizza with olive oil and spread the pizza with ½ of the tomato sauce
| Top with torn mozzarella and sliced Spam.
| Add a final drizzle of olive oil or for a spicy touch, some chili oil.
| Bake for 3 or 4  minutes or until the cheese browns a little - watch it carefully as it can burn easily.
| Remove and sprinkle with torn basil.
| Keep the fist pizza warm at the bottom of the oven whilst you make the second.
| Serve hot
===Chef's note===
If you don't have a pizza peel use an upturned plate or a flat baking tray, dusted with fine yellow cornmeal and some deft handwork to slide the dough onto the stone.
