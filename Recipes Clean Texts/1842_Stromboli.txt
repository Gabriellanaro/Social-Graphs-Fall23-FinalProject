 The Judge 
===Description===

This Italian bread is named after the volcanic island of Stromboli, to the north of Sicily.  this is because the cheese filling is supposed to erupt through holes in the top of the bread.

'''For the dough'''
===Ingredients===
| 15g fresh yeast
| Up to 350ml sparkling water, at room temperature
| 500g strong white bread flour
| Â¾ teaspoons salt
| Pinch of sugar
| 15g olive oil
'''For the filling'''
===Ingredients===NB
| 3 tablespoons olive oil
| Garlic to taste, finely chopped
| 50g sun dried tomatoes, chopped
| A handful of basil leaves
| 250g smoked scamorza cheese
| 125g mozzarella cheese
'''For the topping'''
===Ingredients===NB
| 1 tablespoon olive oil
| 1 teaspoon coarse sea salt
===Method===


| Crumble and dissolve the yeast in half of the water.
| Sieve the flour and salt into a mixing bowl.
| When the yeast has dissolved mix it in with the flour and add the olive oil and the rest of the water as needed to form a moist dough - it is better for the dough to be a little bit too wet than too dry.
| Leave to rest for 10 minutes.
| Lightly flour a work surface and your hands and knead the dough for about 10 minutes until smooth and elastic.  Don't worry about the dough sticking to your hands as it will become less moist as you work it.
| Shape into a ball, place in an oiled bowl and cover with clingfilm.
| Leave until the dough has almost doubled in size (about an hour).
| Gently knock back with your finger tips and repeat steps 6 and 7, but the proving should only take about 45 minutes.
| Generously flour your worksurface and using a rolling pin, roll out the dough into a rectangle about 1cm thick.
| Brush the dough with the olive oil and sprinkle with the garlic, sun dried tomatoes, the basil leaves and the cheeses.
| Roll up the dough like a Swiss roll, stretching the dough if necessary to ensure that the filling ingredients are completely encased.
| Place on a baking tray and allow to prove until almost doubled in size.
| Make some holes in the top of the dough so that he cheese erupts through them.
| Brush with a tablespoon of olive oil and sprinkle with the sea salt.
| Bake at 190\u00b0 C (375\u00b0 F - gas 5), [fan oven 170\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour] for 25 minutes and turn the baking tray around.
| Increase the temperature to 220\u00b0 C (425\u00b0 F - gas 7), [fan oven 200\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour] and bake for a further 20 minutes.
===Serving suggestions===
Lovely on its own, or with salad.
===Variations===
You could also add 6 slices of Parma ham.
===Chef's notes===
Make sure the holes are big enough or they will close during baking.
