Especially if you can get fresh, local walnuts, like Jessies!

===Description===

An interesting pasta dish using walnuts, mushrooms, sage and goats cheese.

As a side note, I created this dish on the same day that we decided to add another two kittens to our cat family.  Meow, meow! 
===Ingredients===

| 15 ml olive oil
| A pinch of freshly ground black pepper
| 1 red onion, finely chopped
| 3 fat garlic cloves, peeled and crushed
| 75 g chestnut mushrooms, thinly sliced
| 75 g walnut pieces
| sea salt
| 200 g fresh tagliatelle
| 75 g goats' cheese, crumbled
| 2 tablespoons fresh sage leaves, chopped

===Method===


| Heat the oil and pepper in a frying pan or wok
| Saute the onions for 3 minutes
| Add the crushed garlic and stir fry for 1 minute, then add the sliced mushrooms and cook until softened
| Add the walnuts, season with salt and stir-fry for a further 3 minutes
| Meanwhile boil the pasta in salted water for about 5 minutes or until cooked to your liking
| Drain the pasta  and mix the walnut sauce, crumbled goats' cheese and sage leaves into the pasta
| Serve topped with a little fresh parsley.
===Serving suggestions===
Fresh tomatoes are always a nice finish to a dish like this.
===Variations===
You could of course use dry pasta instead of fresh, boil until al-dente, about 8 minutes.
