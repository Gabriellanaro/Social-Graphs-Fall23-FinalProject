===Description===

This recipe is just a bit of fun to encourage young children to eat 'proper' pasta as opposed to the tinned varieties.  The Thomas the Tank Engine Pasta shapes are organic and obtainable from some of the main supermarkets.

===Ingredients===
| 50ml olive oil
| 2 medium carrots, scraped and finely diced
| 2 celery sticks, finely diced (include the leaves is you have them)
| 2 medium red onions, peeled and coarsely diced
| 4 cloves of Garlic, peeled and finely diced, or to taste.
| 150ml red wine or vegetable stock
| 1 tbsp tomato pur\u00e9e
| 40 g butter
| 3 red peppers, roasted, peeled and roughly chopped
| 2 x 400 g tins chopped tomatoes
| seasoning
| 1 teaspoon sugar
| 250g Thomas the Tank Engine pasta shapes
| 30g Parmesan cheese, freshly grated (optional)
===Method===


| Heat the oil in a deep saut\u00e9 or frying pan on a high heat.
| When hot, but not smoking, add the carrots, celery, onions and garlic. 
| Reduce the heat to medium and cook until the onions are soft.
| Stir in the wine and tomato pur\u00e9e and allow to cook for 5 minutes, uncovered.
| Add the butter, peppers and the tomatoes.
| Cover and simmer slowly for 1 hour.
| Add the sugar and simmer gently for a further 30 minutes.
| Meanwhile, boil up two kettles-full of water and pour into a large saucepan.
| Once the water is boiling, add the pasta shapes and cook for 7-8 minutes. 
| When the pasta is cooked, drain and  plate immediately.
| Cover with the sauce and serve, sprinkled with grated Parmesan if desired.

===Serving suggestions===
Serve with Italian bread and side salad.
===Variations===
If you are are cooking for young children, use vegetable stock instead of wine and a mild cheese instead of the Parmesan.  Adults, add some chillies or chilli powder to give the sauce a kick!
===Chef's notes===
For a change, I am blending the sauce until smooth - a good way of disguising vegetables for reluctant children.
