===Description===


'''Tiramisu''' is one of the most popular Italian desserts. It is made of savoiardi (sponge fingers) dipped in coffee and mascarpone cream .  It's fairly heavy on the calories, though you could use single cream to reduce them a little!

===Ingredients===
| 16 sponge fingers (savoiardi)
| 150 ml (5 oz) double cream
| 250 g (9 oz) mascarpone cream
| 200 ml strong espresso coffee at room temperature
| 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
| 3 tablespoons rum - brandy or Tia Maria
| 4 tablespoons icing sugar
| Coco powder (ideally in a shaker)
| Sprig of mint to garnish
===Method===


| Whip the cream and 3 tablespoons icing sugar until well mixed
| Beat in the mascarpone, 1 tablespoon of the rum (or brandy or Tia maria) and the vanilla extract
| Mix the remaining sugar and rum (or brandy or Tia maria) into the coffee
| You can either make this directly into serving glasses or make in one dish (which is probably better for the waistline)
| Dip 4 fingers in the coffee and line the bottom of the dish (or 4 serving glasses)
| Add a layer of mascarpone mixture, a layer of soaked sponge fingers and so on
| Finish with a layer of mascarpone
| Pour any remaining coffee mixture over the top and dust with coco powder 
| Chill for 30 minutes before serving
===Serving suggestions===

Garnish with mint leaves
