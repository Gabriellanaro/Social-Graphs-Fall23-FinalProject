===Description===

This is very loosely based on one of the tomato recipes in Jamie Oliver's ''Jamie's Kitchen'', (I think).
[[Image:MacaroniBake ready for the oven.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Ready to bake for 30 minutes]]

It's a great idea for a starting point for many recipes and a very good way to use up your glut of home-grown tomatoes.
===Ingredients===

| 135g dried macaroni, cooked al-dente
| 2 tablespoons olive oil
| A pinch of black pepper
| 1 onion chopped finely
| 100g cooking pancetta, cube
| 3 cloves of garlic, peeled and crushed
| 6 large tomatoes
| 12 small tomatoes
| Â½ a teaspoon of dried dill
| 10 fresh basil leaves
| 1 ball mozzarella cheese
| 2 teaspoons of chilli oil
===Mise en place===

* Cook the pasta for 7-9 minutes in fast boiling salted water.  Drain well.
* Pre-heat your oven to 180\u00b0 C (350\u00b0 F - gas 4), [fan oven 160\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]

===Method===


| Saute the chopped onion in a tablespoon of olive oil for 3 minutes.
| Stir in the cubed pancetta and stir-fry so it takes a tiny bit of colour.
| Add the crushed garlic and cook for a minute, stirring while it cooks.
| Pour this mixture into a smallish baking tray and move it around so it coats the base with the oil.
| Halve the small tomatoes and quarter the large tomatoes and add them to the tray with the macaroni and dried dill.
| Chop the basil leaves, reserve half for garnish and add the rest to the mixture.  Stir well to combine.
| Crumble the ball of mozzarella over the top and drizzle with the remaining olive oil and chilli oil.
| Bake at the top of a  180\u00b0 C oven for 30 minutes or until the mozzarella cheese starts to crust.
| Garnish with the remaining chopped basil.
===Serving suggestions===
This is nice served with crusty bread and would probably stretch to four people if served this way.
