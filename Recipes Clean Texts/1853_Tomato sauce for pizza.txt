One of my favourite recipes.  We make 6 times this amount at one time and freeze the remains in plastic cups for making pizzas.

===Description===

If you are making your own pizzas, then you'll need this recipe for a spicy topping.

We find this recipe so good, I make large batches and freeze in plastic coffee cups and vacuum-seal for later use.  Half a plastic cup is enough for 2 large pizzas. 

There is a good basic pizza dough recipe here.

===Ingredients===
| 30 ml olive oil
| 1 onion, peeled and chopped
| 2 garlic cloves, crushed
| ½ teaspoon chili pepper flakes
| Pinch chili powder
| 90 ml red wine
| Dash of sherry vinegar
| 1 tablespoon tomato puree
| 1 x 400 g can peeled plum tomatoes, chopped
| Big handful basil leaves, torn
| 2 teaspoons dried oregano
| sprig fresh thyme leaves,
| 1 teaspoon demerara sugar
| 1 tablespoon Parmesan cheese, freshly grated
| Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste

===Method===


| Heat the oil in a pan and add the garlic, chili flakes, chili powder and onions and fry gently until translucent, about 4 minutes
| Add the paprika powder, red wine and sherry vinegar and simmer to reduce by half
| Add the chopped tomatoes to the pan with the tomato puree and bring to the boil
| Add the remaining herbs, reduce and simmer for 30 minutes
| Pour the sauce into a food processor with a blade and blitz to a puree
| ''or'', if you have a stick blender, a few minutes with that will have the same effect, ideal if you're using a slow cooker.  
| Return to the pan and add the sugar and Parmesan cheese and cook for a further 15 minutes
| Season with salt and pepper, the final consistency should be a paste not runny.  Reduce a little more if required.
| Allow to cool
===Chef's tip===
Recently I made a huge batch of pizza topping with this years' surplus tomatoes with the intention to vacuum pack them into single pizza portions. I used the basic procedure as above, but for the reducing stage, added the sauce to a slow cooker on high to 12 hours, uncovered (or until the sauce reaches a nice thick consistency).  The sauce was then frozen into about half full paper coffee and then vacuum packed.  An absolute success.   

If you are making the sauce ahead of the pizzas and it needs further reduction, just remove from the heat and leave to dry  out a little, naturally.  This works especially well in a large frying pan.

A brilliant, but rather obvious idea that has only come to me recently, is to make double the amount, bag it up and freeze it in one or two pizza portions.  Home made pizzas are great, but sometimes it's too much hassle to have to make the sauce as well.

Bottled bolognese type sauce makes a good very pizza topping with very little effort. Freeze the remainder in pizza portion sized bags for the next pizza making session.
