===Description===




Probably Italy's most famous soup.  This is my adapted, vegetarian version of Elizabeth David's recipe from ''Italian Food'' (ISBN 0140460985).

===Ingredients===
| 3 tablespoons olive oil
| 2 onions, finely chopped
| Garlic to taste, chopped
| 1 tablespoon fresh or 1 teaspoon each of dried thyme and oregano
| 4 tomatoes, peeled and chopped or if not in season, 1 x 400g tin of tomatoes, drained
| 125ml red wine
| 110g cannellini beans, soaked overnight
| 1.75 litres vegetable stock
| 2 carrots, peeled and diced - about 200g after trimming and peeling
| 2 small waxy potatoes, peeled and diced - about 125g after trimming and peeling
| 1 small turnip, peeled and diced - about 100g after trimming and peeling
| 90g French beans, trimmed and cut in half
| 1 stick celery, chopped
| ½ small cabbage (or a whole sweetheart cabbage, shredded
| 50g orzo, or other small pasta shapes
| 2 tablespoons of Parmesan cheese
| Seasoning
| Extra Parmesan cheese for serving
===Method===


| Heat the oil in a deep pan and gently saut\u00e9 the onions, garlic and herbs.
| Stir in the tomatoes and red wine and allow to bubble for a couple of minutes.
| Add the drained cannellini beans and the stock and boil gently (covered) for 2 hours.
| Add the carrots, and 15 minutes later, uncover, and add the potatoes and turnip.
| 10 minutes later, add the French beans, celery, cabbage and orzo.
| After a further 10 minutes, stir in the Parmesan and check seasoning.
| Serve more Parmesan separately.
===Variations===
Use haricot or other white beans and you can vary the vegetables.  Some Italian sources say that little or no tomato should be included, so you can leave them out if desired.
