Not at all keen on this - might be ok with another fish, like basa?

===Description===


Ackee and saltfish is Jamaica's national dish.

You will probably have to use canned ackee unless you are in the West Indies.

Salt fish is salt cod which needs to be soaked overnight and rinsed well to rehydrate and remove excess salt.  Don't boil it an an attempt to rehydrate it.  You'll end up with salty rubber!

===Ingredients===

| 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
| ½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
| 4 cloves of garlic, peeled and crushed
| 1 large onion, peeled and sliced
| 1 Scotch bonnet chilli pepper, finely chopped with the seeds removed if preferred
| 450g [1 lb] salt cod (saltfish)
| 2 sweet peppers of any colour, deseeded and chopped
| 2 tomatoes, chopped
| 1 400g can of tinned ackee
| 1 sprig of fresh thyme or 1 level teaspoon of dried thyme
===Mise en place===

* Soak the saltfish (salt cod) overnight in plenty of fresh cold water, changing a few times if you are able.  Rinse well.

===Method===


| Once the saltfish has been soaked for 24 hours and rinsed, simmer gently for 25 minutes and discard the water.
| Heat the oil in a frying pan or wok, add the black pepper and gently fry the onions and sweet peppers for 5 minutes.  
|Add the crushed garlic and chopped chilli pepper and stir-fry for another few minutes
| Add the salt cod and fry for 5 minutes, allowing the flesh to break up a little
| Stir in the thyme, season to taste and serve.
===Serving suggestions===
Serve with a salad or rice and peas and plenty of chilli sauce
