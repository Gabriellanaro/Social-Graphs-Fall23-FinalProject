===Description===



Akkra are bean fritters which originated in Western Africa, but with the slave trade they spread to the Caribbean and Brazil. Crispy on the outside and creamy in the middle, they are variously known as akra, acra, accra, acrat and acaraj\u00e9.  This particular version comes from Jamaica.

===Ingredients===
| 450 g black eyed peas
| 3-4 green chillies, roughly chopped
| Salt to taste
| Oil for frying
===Method===


| Wash and soak the peas overnight in hot water.
| Remove the outer skins and then soak again until they are fully swollen.
| Drain and place in a food processor with the chillies and salt.
| Blend until the mixture is smooth.
| Heat the oil in a deep pan or fryer.
| Drop spoonfuls of the mixture into the fat in batches and fry until golden brown.
| Drain on kitchen paper and serve.
