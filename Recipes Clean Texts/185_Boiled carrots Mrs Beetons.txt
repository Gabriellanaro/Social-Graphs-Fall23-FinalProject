===Description===

This recipe is here for a bit of fun.  The recommended cooking times are unbelievable.    I'm surprised that there would be anything left after boiling for an hour and a half!  This would be how to make carrot puree.  Anyway, this is how it would have been done in her day!

===Ingredients===
| To each 4 pints water allow 1 heaped teaspoon of salt
| Â½ lb carrots per person
===Method===


| Cut off the green tops, wash and scrape the carrots, and remove any black specks.
| If the carrots are very large, cut them in halves , divide them lengthwise into four pieces and put them into boiling water, salted in the above proportion;
| Let them boil  until tender which may be ascertained by piercing the carrots with a fork, then drain well
| Young carrots should be boiled whole
===Time===
# Young carrots, about half an hour
# Old ones from 1 hour to 1 and a half hours

===Sufficient===
# Allow 1lb for 2 or 3 persons
