Curry goat with the Ivan Garford Trio.

 

Klapaucius 

This is one of Jamaica's national dishes and is served on festive occasions.

===Ingredients===
| 1 kg goat meat, cut into small chunks
| Salt and pepper
| 3 tablespoons curry powder (See \"Chef's notes\" below)
| Garlic to taste, crushed
| 2 tomatoes, chopped
| 2 onions, sliced
| 2 spring onions, sliced
| 1-2 hot chillies, finely chopped
| 30 g butter
| 50 ml oil
| 750 ml hot water
===Method===


| Place the goat in a bowl and season.
| Mix in the curry powder, garlic, tomatoes, onions, spring onions and chillies.
| Allow to marinate for about an hour or more.
| Heat the butter and oil in a pan and fry the goat until it is lightly browned - try to brush off any garlic or vegetables before frying or they may burn.
| Add enough water to cover the meat and bring to the boil.
| Reduce the heat, cover and simmer until the meat is tender, adding more water if necessary.
| Stir in the seasoning and vegetables in which the goat was marinating, cover again and simmer for 10 minutes.
===Serving suggestions===
Serve with rice, mango chutney, grated coconut or whatever else you like.
===Chef's notes===
Make the curry powder with:

1 part each of fenugreek, cardamom and cinnamon and

4 parts each of coriander, turmeric, ginger and black pepper.

All the spice should be ground.
