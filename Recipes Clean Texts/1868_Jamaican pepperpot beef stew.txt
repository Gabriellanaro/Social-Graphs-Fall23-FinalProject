I prefer Indian curries, but this one is not at all bad!

 

 The Judge 
===Description===

A spicy Jamaican / West Indian meat stew that is often served with dumplings.

This recipe is a very meaty version and I have included a small amount of chopped kidneys for extra flavour.

Our other Pepperpot recipe has a much higher ratio of vegetables, and would also be more economical.  I think this is better though!

This recipe is also highly suited for use in a slow cooker - cook on low for about 4 hours.
===Ingredients===

| 2 tablespoons plain flour
| 1 teaspoon ground ginger powder
| 1 teaspoon sea salt
| 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
| 900g stewing steak, cubed
| 2 tablespoons olive oil
| 400g tinned tomatoes
| 100g fresh button mushrooms, sliced
| 1 teaspoon hot chilli sauce [or to taste]
| 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
| 1 heaped tablespoon soft brown sugar or jaggery
| 2 tablespoons red wine vinegar
| 4 cloves of garlic, peeled and crushed
| 1 bay leaf
| 1 Stick of cinnamon
====to serve====
===Ingredients===NB
| 1 tablespoon chopped parsley
===Mise en place===

* Preheat your oven to 160\u00b0 C (325\u00b0 F - gas 3), [fan oven 140\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]
* If using a slow cooker set to low.

===Method===


| Mix the flour, ground ginger, salt and pepper together and mix well - I use a mortar and pestle to break down the sea salt.
| Dredge the steak in the seasoned flour to coat well. A really good way to do this is add the seasoned flour and the meat to a Lock & Lock box, close the lid and shake like mad.  As you can see from the picture it does a good job!
| Heat the oil and fry the meat in batches until browned.  Add a little more oil if needed.
| Tip everything, including any left over seasoned flour, into a lidded oven-proof casserole dish and mix well.
| Cook for 3.5 hours at 160\u00b0 C (325\u00b0 F)
| Remove the bay leaf before serving.
===Serving suggestions===
Sprinkle with the chopped parsley and serve with rice or potatoes and dumplings and a green vegetable.
===Variations===
I used 530g 1 pack of stewing beef and 1 440g pack of stewing beef and kidneys, mixed. I also used 6 large cloves of garlic and added a small glass of red wine as, unusually, there was some left over from the night before!

As this was so nice, I made a second batch using steak and kidneys and to make it go further as it is quite rich, I added a can of drained kidney beans and 2 cans of tinned tomatoes. Instead of chili sauce I used 2 small red chillies (de-seeded) and one Indian green chilli including seeds.
