This Jamaican recipe is designed to be cooked slowly on a barbecue, although it could be made using a conventional grill on a low setting.

===Ingredients===
| 2 kg pork chops
| 50 g allspice berries
| 6 escallions, fat spring onions or small leeks, chopped
| 2-3 Scotch bonnet chillies, chopped
| 4 fresh cinnamon leaves (use bay leaves if not available)
| Salt and black pepper
| Allspice berries and bay leaves to throw on coals
===Method===


| Wash and dry the pork.
| Heat the allspice berries in a small frying pan, stirring them for 5 minutes.
| Crush them in a grinder or a mortar.
| Add the escallions, or spring onions or leeks, the chillies, the cinnamon or bay leaves, salt and pepper and grind until you have a thick paste.
| Rub the paste all over the pork and leave for at least 1 hour or preferably overnight in the fridge.
| Place the meat on the barbecue grill, which if possible should be on the highest notch as the meat needs to cook slowly.
| Throw allspice berries and bay leaves over the coals.
| Turn the chops half way through the cooking time, the total of which should be 1 hour.
===Serving suggestions===
Serve with lots of salad and Johnny cakes.  Also goes well with rice.
===Chef's notes===
If your barbecue grill cannot be raised from the coals, you will need to control the heat by only using a few pieces of charcoal at a time.
