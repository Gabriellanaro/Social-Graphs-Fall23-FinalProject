===Description===

This is mercilessly plagiarised from the TV series; Jamie Oliver cooks Christmas.  I made the jerk marinade yesterday and have already tried it with pan fried pork fillets and it was great.

I found the jerk marinade a bit heavy on the cloves, so I have omitted the cloves in the boiling stage.

This is a little long winded and it obviously takes a fair bit of planning, but it is worth doing, that I promise!

'''Boiling the gammon'''
===Ingredients===
| 1.4 kg gammon (unsmoked) - I chose one with very little skin as it will be discarded after boiling
| ''If you have a shrink-wrapped gammon, be sure to remove the inner plastic wrapping so the marinade can penetrate properly.''
| big bunch of parsley
| 15 peppercorns
| A big handful of Chinese preserved orange peel
| Big stick of cinnamon
'''Marinade stage'''
===Ingredients===NB
| 250 ml (3 ladles-full) of jerk marinade
'''Roasting stage'''
===Ingredients===NB
| 3 tablespoons of Rhubarb and ginger preserve (or a similar marmalade)
| 10 ml rum

===Method===
'''Boiling'''

| Place the gammon and the boiling ingredients in a large pan and just cover with boiling water
| Fast simmer for about an hour
| remove, drain, and allow to cool
| Slice the skin off and discard.  Try to leave a layer of fat on the meat
| Score the fat in a criss-cross pattern, trying not to cut into the meat
'''Marinading'''

| Marinade in a cool place for as long as you can - I went for 4 days. Keep in a cool place and in a sealed container if you have adventurous cats!
| If you get the chance, turn the gammon every day and spoon the marinade over the meat
'''Roasting'''

| Preheat the oven to 200\u00b0 C (400\u00b0 F - gas 6)
| Put the gammon in a deep roasting tray and roast for 1 hour 50 minutes in total
| Mix the rhubarb preserve or marmalade with a splash of rum to liquify it a little
| After 1 hour 20 minutes has expired, take the tray out and deglaze the pan with a splash of rum
| Spread the preserve over the surface of the gammon and roast for another 30 minutes or so.  Check it every 8 minutes and re-baste with the preserve
| Remove, rest for 10 minutes and serve
===Serving suggestions===
Serve hot with boiled potatoes, garden peas, pease pudding and a sprinkling of parsley
===Variations===
Vary the ingredients that you add in the boiling stage to your own taste.  Carrots, leeks, parsnip are all good flavour enhancers.

Jamie made his with marmalade but I thought the rhubarb and ginger preserve went better with the warm spices.  Experiment with your favourite preserve.

===Chef's note===
Cooking times will vary for larger joints, and after tasting this I would recommend the biggest joint you can afford!

If you have a Jaccard meat tenderiser, stab the joint all over with it so the marinade can penetrate really well.
===Notes on gammon cooking times===
Usually a gammon joint is cooked by boiling, either in a large saucepan (about 1.5 hours to 2.5 hours depending upon weight), or a quicker method is to cook in a pressure cooker (1 hour). After this process, the gammon will be cooked and perfectly safe to eat, however, often the gammon is then finished by roasted with a glaze (honey, marmalade, Branston pickle, etc.  This finishing process does make for an extended cooking time but it does give an exceptional finish.
