I think it was the callaloo; too slimy.

One of the most famous of Caribbean dishes, this version of pepperpot comes from Jamaica.  Some of the vegetables are rather unusual in the UK, so you should see if you can get them from a specialist West Indian greengrocer.

===Ingredients===
| 500 g callaloo (Amaranth), finely chopped
| 12 okras, finely chopped
| 250 g pigs' tails or salt beef
| 250 g shin of beef
| 2.75 litres water
| 750 ml coconut milk
| 250 g yellow yam, peeled and sliced
| 250 g coco (taro root), peeled and sliced
| 2 escallions, finely chopped
| 1 hot chilli pepper, sliced
| Black pepper
===Method===


| Put the callaloo, okra, pigs' tails or salt beef and the shin of beef in a large pot with the water.
| Bring to the boil and them simmer until the meats are tender (about 2 hours).
| Add the coconut milk, yam, coco, escallions, chilli pepper and a little ground black pepper.
| Add more water if necessary, although the soup should be fairly thick.
| Simmer for a further 30 minutes.
===Variations===
If you are unable to find callaloo you could replace it with spinach.  Use large spring onions or small leeks if you cannot get escallions.
