===Description===


'Run down' is really 'boiling down' coconut milk to form a custard and coconut oil in this Jamaican fish recipes

===Ingredients===

| Add the fish, cover, and cook for 10 minutes over a medium heat.
| Stir in the onion, garlic, escallions, tomatoes, Scotch bonnet and thyme, reduce the heat, and simmer for a further 10 minutes.
===Serving suggestions===
