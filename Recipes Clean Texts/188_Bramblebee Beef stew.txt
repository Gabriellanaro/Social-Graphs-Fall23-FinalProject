===Description===


A proper beef stew, one that you'll need a proper butcher for!
===Ingredients===

| 2 ox cheeks, cubed [about 1.6 kg combined weight]
| 20g Plain flour
| Good pinch of Himalayan pink sea salt
| Good pinch of freshly ground black pepper
| 20 ml olive oil
| 2 large red onions, peeled and chopped
| 4 fat garlic cloves, peeled and crushed
| 1 large carrot, chopped
| 200 ml Red wine
| 750 ml chicken stock
| 1 pig's trotter
| 1 sprig of thyme
| 2 bay leaves
| 1 tablespoon sherry vinegar
| 1 teaspoon jaggery

===Method===


| Mix the flour, salt and black pepper together in a lock&lock box, add the cubed ox cheek, close the lid and shake like mad to coat the meat.
| Heat a wok or frying pan and add the olive oil
| Saute the ox cheeks until browned
| Remove the browned cheeks and fry the carrots and onions for five minutes
| Add the garlic and stir-fry until it start to colour, then immediately add the red wine, stir and bring to the boil
| Add the herbs, pig's trotter and chicken stock
| Bring to the boil and then remove from the heat
| Add this mixture to your slow cooker and cook for 6 hours
| After 6 hours, discard the pigs trotter, sieve the gravy from the meat, leaving the meat in the cooker. In a separate pan, heat and reduce the gravy by a third so it's nice, thick and sticky.
| Stir in the Worcestershire sauce, sherry vinegar, mix it back into the meat and serve.
===Serving suggestions===
Serve with broccoli, cauliflower and roast potatoes
===Variations===
If you don't have a slow cooker, use a casserole dish, covered, in an oven heated to 120\u00b0 C (250\u00b0 F - gas \u00bd), [fan oven 100\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]
===Chef's notes===
I've use some fairly specialised ingredients as I have easy access to them.

Everything in this recipe can be substituted and it will still be great, for example: salt, pepper, beef stock, oxo cube, any vinegar, white sugar, omit the pig's trotter, use beef shin, diced chuck steak, beef short ribs or just stewing steak.
