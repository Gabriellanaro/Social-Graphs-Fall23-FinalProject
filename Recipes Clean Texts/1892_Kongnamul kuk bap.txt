The Judge 

A spicy breakfast dish of rice from the city of Chonju in the south-west of Korea.

===Ingredients===
| 1 tablespoon sesame oil
| Garlic to taste, finely diced
| 1 spring onion, sliced
| 182 ml rice, cooked
| 25 g bean sprouts, blanched in boiling water for 2 minutes
| 240 ml water from blanching the bean sprouts 
| Â¼ teaspoon salt
| 1 large egg
| 1 teaspoon toasted sesame seeds
| 1 teaspoon chilli powder, or to taste
===Method===


| In a saucepan, heat the sesame oil and gently fry the garlic and spring onion until soft.
| Add the rice, bean sprouts, hot water and salt and mix well.
| Then add the sesame seeds and chilli powder and break the egg over the mixture.
| Bring to the boil over a medium heat and cook for 2 minutes, without stirring.
| Finally, stir the egg into the mixture and remove from the heat.
| Serve hot.
===Serving suggestions===
This can be accompanied by a cabbage or radish kimchi.  Although this is actually a breakfast dish, you may wish to serve it as an accompaniment to a main course.
===Chef's notes===
The Koreans generally use a medium-grained rice, as they are not so fond of Basmati or long-grained rice as the latter varieties are of course found mainly in India and the Middle East.  However, I did in fact use Basmati.
