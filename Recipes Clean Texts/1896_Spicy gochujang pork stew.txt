Way too hot!

Far too hot and much too acidic for my taste.

===Description===



After watching a Food Network Korean food special featuring John Torode on I was inspired to get some more Gochujang and try a few experiments.   This is the first result.

I would normally use pork shoulder or a similar cut for this type of recipe, but as I had some fatty gammon available I used that.

I have documented this so I have a good record which I can use to modify and improve this recipe.   I fear this first experiment may be too spicy!

It transpires that my fears were well grounded.  On tasting the stew it was way too hot to eat so I made an attempt to rescue the meal by draining and  discarding the existing sauce and adding a can of chopped tomatoes for the final 30 minutes.  The result was rather good and much less hot.

The ingredients below are the modified version!
===Ingredients===

| 2 small gammon steaks with plenty of fat, sliced
| 1 tablespoon olive oil
| 1 large leek, cleaned and chopped
| 1 small cabbage, chopped
| 250 ml chicken stock
====marinade====
===Ingredients===NB
| 1 teaspoon Szechuan peppercorns, crushed
| 2 teaspoons of taste sensation tomato powder
| Â½ of a teaspoon of Taste Sensation Lime Juice Powder
| 1 bulb of garlic, peeled, half chopped, half crushed
| 2 tablespoons gochujang
| 4 tablespoons fresh ginger, sliced
===Mise en place===

* Marinade the gammon slices for 12 to 24 hours in the spicy marinade.

===Chef's notes===
The original ingredients used, pictured, made the recipe far too hot.  The current ingredients are my 'suggested' changes and I will update this page as I improve this recipe.
