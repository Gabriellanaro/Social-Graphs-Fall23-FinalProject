And I know because I've tried Bramblebee's sausage meat - from Old Spot piggies. \ud83d\udc37\ud83d\udc16\ud83e\udd69\ud83e\udd53

===Description===

===Best to make 5 Scotch Eggs, than 6!===
After making these a few time, I think it is better to use more sausage meat per egg.  It's easier to 'stuff' the egg.

The Bramblebee farm Scotch eggs are really easy to make at home - if you can't get a tube of Bramblebee farm sausage meat, you can always remove the sausage meat from normal sausages.  You'll need about 180g of meat for each Scotch egg.

Only use small or medium sized eggs or you won't have enough sausage meat to cover the Scotch eggs.

These don't need to be coated with anything providing you cook them on greaseproof paper.  Or you could sit them on a patch of breadcrumbs or a square of bread.
===Ingredients===
| A tube of Bramblebee Farm Lincolnshire sausage meat - ''about 975g''.
| 5 small or medium free range eggs - '''ensure the eggs are at least 4 days old or you will be unable to peel them easily'''.
===Mise en place===

* Add the eggs to a pan of warm water and bring to the boil.  Once the water is boiling, time the eggs for exactly 5 minutes.  Remove the pan from the heat and allow to cool.
* Peel the hard-boiled eggs using a teaspoon.  Doing this under a trickle of water sometimes makes the task a little easier.
* Preheat your oven to 180\u00b0 C (350\u00b0 F - gas 4), [fan oven 160\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]

===Method===


| If you are going to add any flavourings to the sausage meat, do this now.
| Divide the sausage meat into 5 equal portions and press each portion into a round 'burger-type' pattie, about 13 cm [5 inches] in diameter.
| Place a hard-boiled egg in the centre of the pattie and work it into a ball, ensuring there is no ''seam''.
| Place the eggs on o non-stick baking tray or a baking tray covered with grease-proof paper.
| Bake in the oven for 35 minutes, turning once if you get the chance.
| Allow to cool and serve.
===Variations===
Roll in with breadcrumbs, poppy seeds or sesame seeds before cooking.
