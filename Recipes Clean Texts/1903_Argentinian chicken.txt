===Description===

This recipe was recently added by Graciela Narro, one of our Argentinian visitors.  I have converted it to our standard format and after cooking it , clarified some of the quantities and slightly adjusted the cooking times.

This is a fabulous recipe and so easy to make!

===Ingredients===
| 800g chicken pieces (bone in)
| A bunch of leaves of parsley
| Garlic to taste, peeled.  I used 6 fat cloves of garlic
| Half a medium size onion, peeled and roughly chopped
| 2 teaspoons of dried oregano
| 1 heaped teaspoon of paprika powder
| 1 large red sweet pepper, deseeded
| Â¼ cup of olive oil
| 3 tablespoons of white wine vinegar.
| 2 heaped teaspoons of chicken stock powder


===Mise en place===
* Preheat the oven to 180\u00b0 C (350\u00b0 F - gas 4), [fan oven 160\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]
===Method===


| Put the chicken in an oven tray
| Put the rest of the ingredients in the blender and blend for 2 minutes
| Try to check taste
| Pour it over chicken
| Cover with a lid or tin-foil 
| Put it in the top of the oven for 45 minutes
| Check the chicken is properly cooked
| Enjoy!

===Chef's notes===
This recipe is a good candidate for jointing a small chicken - I prefer to also remove the skin in a dish like this, but that's a personal preference.

I added a little extra water after blending as the mix looked rather dry, however this was probably not necessary as the cooked chicken had more than enough sauce.
