Arros tapado (Spanish for molded rice) is very popular in Peru and is a favourite among children because the recipe calls for molding rice and minced beef into a shape.

The minced beef preparation is very similar to picadillo (Spanish for minced meat) which is popular throughout Latin America and the Philippines. In most other countries picadillo is served with white rice on the side.

| 3 Cloves of garlic, minced
| 2 tablespoons of olive oil
| 20 ml lemon juice
| salt
| 4 cups water
| 450 g [1 lb] rice
| 1 onion, finely chopped
| 900 g [2 lb] of ground beef
| 2 tomatoes, finely chopped
| 1 tablespoon tomato paste
| 4 tablespoons of raisins
| 5 black olives, chopped
| 3 hard boiled eggs; two chopped, one whole
| 1 tablespoon parsley, finely minced
===Method===


| Saut\u00e9 the garlic in oil, add a few drops of lemon juice, salt and the water and bring to a boil.
| Add rice and cook until tender. This should take 20 to 25 minutes.
| In another pan, stir in onions and saut\u00e9.
| Add meat, tomatoes, tomato paste, raisins, olives and cook for 10 minutes, stirring all the while.
