 The Judge 
===Description===

Another variation on my favourite way to cook pork, this time using Bramblebee Farms Old Spot pork.  Not wanting to compromise on the pulled pork I'm not making any attempt to use the rind as crackling.

This really is best if it can marinate for 8 hours before the cooking.  Just make sure that you plan this one well ahead.

The trick to this recipe is cooking it on a low heat for 8 hours and making sure it does not dry out.
===Ingredients===

| 1.2 kg bramblebee farms Old Spot pork joint, not rolled
====for the marinade====
===Ingredients===NB
| 300 ml Guinness
| 1 whole bulb of garlic, that's about 8 cloves of garlic, peeled and crushed
| 50 ml olive oil
| 30 ml Worcestershire sauce
| Juice of 1 lemon
| 1 tablespoon black treacle
| 1 teaspoon curry paste
| 3 teaspoon sweet paprika
| 1 teaspoon smoked paprika
| 2 bay leaves, crumpled
| Bunch of sage leaves, picked
| A few pinches of fresh thyme leaves 
| Good pinch of salt
| Good pinch of freshly ground black pepper
====for ''the bed''====
===Ingredients===NB
| 1 red onion, peeled and sliced
| Skin of 1 lemon torn into pieces
| 1 peeled, cored and sliced bramley apple
| Bunch of sage leaves, picked
===Mise en place===

* Cut a few slashes in the rind so the marinade can penetrate the meat from both sides
* Mix the marinade ingredients together and stir well.
* Add to a large lock&lock box together with the unrolled pork, pop the lid on, shake really well and leave in the fridge for 8 hours or mare, shaking and inverting now and again to get an even marinade.

===Method===


| Preheat the oven to 140\u00b0 C (257\u00b0 F - gas 1), [fan oven 120\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour] before you begin cooking
| Place the ''bed'' items evenly in a large roasting tray
| Join 2 large sheets of tin foil to make an air-tight seal so they will cover the roasting tray so the joint does not dry out
| Lay the Old Spot pork joint on top of the ''bed'', rind-side up
| Loosely cover the roasting tray, rolling the foil around the edges to the steam does not escape
| Roast for 7 hours.  Baste at least three times, replacing the foil everytime
| After the seven hours, remove the meat from the roasting tray and place on a cutting board, remove and discard the rind and any large pieces of fat.  Roughly shred the pork.
| From the gravy, discard the lemon, most of the onion slices and any wood herbs.  Use a potato masher to mash the apple and any remaining onion.
| Pop the pork back into the gravy and shred more finely with a pair of forks
| Cover and return to the oven for the final hour, then serve with as much gravy as you need

===Serving suggestions===
This works equally well as a hot meal with roast potatoes and vegetables as it does warm, with a salad and pitta breads.

Cover any leftovers with the gravy and refrigerate once cooled.  This keeps it moist.  Serve with a salad and pitta breads the following day after skimming any excess fat and mixing well.
