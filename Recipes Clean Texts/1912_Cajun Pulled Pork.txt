I just love Taste Sensation's spices.  Makes this recipe dead easy.

===Description===

I am experimenting with spice mixes from Taste Sensation Ltd; their Tex Mex marinade was wonderful so I arranged to get samples of their popular blends.

As this is an experiment I bought 1.4kg of pork shoulder and got the butcher to cut it into three slices.  This recipe uses one of those slices. I can use the other two to experiment with more of the Taste Sensation seasonings.
===Ingredients===

| 1400 g pork shoulder
| 2 medium red onions, peeled and chopped
| 1 lemon cut into eight pieces
| 2 tablespoons of Taste Sensation Cajun Seasoning
| 200 ml red wine
| 1 tablespoon of muscovado sugar

===Method===


| Squeeze the lemon to collect the lemon juice while retaining the lemon pieces
| Pour the red wine and lemon juice over the pork
| Sprinkle the Taste Sensation Cajun Seasoning over the pork
| Line the slow cooker with the chopped onions and lemon pieces
| Lay the pork shoulder over the lemon and onions
| Sprinkle the muscovado sugar over everything
| Slow cook on medium heat for 8 hours, turning now and then
| If it looks to be drying out too much add a little extra liquid, water or beverage of your choice!
| If you are able, about halfway through remove the rind and excess fat, together with the lemon pieces
| After eight hours, shred the pork with two forks and mix into the gravy
| Serve!
===Serving suggestions===
There are lots of great ways to serve pulled pork:

* In rolled up soft flour tortillas with crispy lettuce and onions

* In taco shells with a salad mix and sour cream

* As you would serve roast pork

* As a pizza topping

* In a burger bun with a salad

* As part of a tapa
===Chef's notes===
This was very, very good.  Impressed with the Cajun Seasoning, not too hot but had tangy, herby notes. I needed to add a little extra liquid near the end, but only 50 ml or so.
