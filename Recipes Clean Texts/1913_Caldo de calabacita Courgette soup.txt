===Description===

This recipe for courgette soup comes from Paraguay.

===Ingredients===
| 30ml vegetable oil
| 1 medium onion, finely chopped
| Garlic to taste, chopped
| 1.2 litres vegetable stock
| 3 tablespoons rice
| 450g courgettes, grated
| Seasoning
| 1 free range egg
| 3 tablespoons Parmesan cheese, grated
| 1 tablespoon parsley, finely chopped
===Method===


| Heat the oil in a fairly large saucepan and saut\u00e9 the onion and garlic until the onion is soft.
| Add the stock and the rice and simmer, covered, for 10 minutes.
| Add the courgettes and season to taste.
| Simmer until the courgettes are very tender, about 15 minutes.
| In a soup tureen beat the egg with the cheese and parsley, then whisk in the soup, mixing well.
===Variation===
The Spanish name of this soup literally means 'Squash soup', so you could use squash or pumpkin instead of courgettes.
