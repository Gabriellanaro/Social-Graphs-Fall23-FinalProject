From Carla's cookery blog: ''[http://www.margaritascubancuisine.blogspot.co.uk/ Carla's cookery blog]''

\"Would you like to try something different to go with your Holiday Ham? Here is a fantastic cornbread recipe with a bit of a Caribbean twist - pineapple! . Give it a try and let me know what you think. I think it would be excellent with some barbecued jerk chicken too.\"

===Ingredients===

| 1 cup all purpose flour
| 1 cup cornmeal 
| 2 tablespoons baking powder
| 1 teaspoon salt
| 1 cup butter, softened to room temperature
| .75 cup sugar
| 4 free range eggs
| 1.5 cups canned cream-style corn
| .5 cup canned crushed pineapple, drained
| 1 cup shredded Monterrey jack cheese or mild white cheddar cheese
===Mise en place===

* Preheat the oven to 160\u00b0 C (325\u00b0 F - gas 3), [fan oven 140\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]

===Method===


| Butter and flour a 9-inch square glass cake pan (you can use a metal pan but glass works better).
| In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, cornmeal, baking powder and salt; set aside.
| Using an electric mixer, cream butter and sugar.
| While mixer is running, add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition.
| Add corn, pineapple and cheese; mix to blend.
| At low speed, add flour mixture and mix until well blended.
| Pour batter into pan and bake until golden brown around edges and a tester inserted in the center comes out clean, about 1 hour.
===Variations===
Optionally sprinkle some Scotch Bonnet Pepper or jalape\u00f1o peppers to add some fire.
