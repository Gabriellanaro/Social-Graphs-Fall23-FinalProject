===Description===

This recipe is a great way of using up leftovers. It came about because I needed to use up a (frozen) carton of Waitrose green Thai chicken soup and also needed a photograph of enchiladas.  

The ingredients were those to hand so you could easily meddle with them.

'''If you are not using a spicy soup, then add a few finely chopped chillies (to taste) and either a can of chicken soup or some chicken stock that has been thickened with a tablespoon of flour.'''

===Ingredients===
| 220 g chicken fillets, chopped
| 600g pot of green Thai chicken soup -  or 568 lm (1 pint) chicken stock, thickened with flour or cornflour
| 150 g Emmenthal cheese, grated
| 2 sticks of celery, chopped into thin crescents ''(half moons)''
| 1 large onion, peeled and sliced
| 3 tablespoons garlic olive oil or olive oil and 1 garlic clove, crushed
| 8 closed-cup mushrooms, sliced thinly
| 7 sun-dried tomatoes, sliced (in oil, with a little of the oil, if needed)
| 1 teaspoon freshly ground white cumin seeds
| 1 teaspoon dried oregano leaves
| 1 green bell pepper, sliced
| 8 flour or corn tortillas


===Mise en place=== 
* Preheat the oven to 180\u00b0 C (350\u00b0 F - Gas 4) 

===Method===


| In a wok or frying pan, heat the garlic olive oil gently and fry the celery and onions for about 5 minutes until softened
| Add the mushrooms and sliced tomatoes and a little of the oil if needed
| Fry for a few minutes
| Tip in the chopped chicken fillets and the ground spices and cook until the chicken seems done
| Add 100 g of the Emmenthal cheese and stir until melted and well mixed
| Add the chopped peppers and stir without cooking any further
| Divide the mix into eight portions and roll up in the tortillas
| Place in an oven proof dish
| Pour the soup over the tortillas and sprinkle with the remaining cheese
| Bake for 30 minutes
