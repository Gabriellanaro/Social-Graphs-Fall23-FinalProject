And deliciously simple.

 

 The Judge 
===Description===

Tried this as an experiment last night and it was so very good, I had to put the recipe down so it can be easily repeated.  To be fair, it's not really a glaze, more of a flavouring.  The gammon was sweet all the way through and not a bit salty.

The times and temperatures are fairly flexible providing the gammon reaches the safe temperature of 62 \u00b0C (145 \u00b0F): Safe minimum cooking temperatures

The the flavourings again are also flexible.  I chose branston pickle and apple sauce as they were to hand - and an excellent choice though I say so myself!
===Ingredients===

| 2 x 200g gammon steaks
| 2 tablespoons branston pickle
| 2 tablespoons Apple sauce
| Pinch of Taste Sensation Lime Juice Powder (or teaspoons lime juice)

===Method===


| Add the gammon steaks, branston pickle, apple sauce and lime juice to a sous vide vacuum bag
| Vacuum seal the bag and squish the flavourings around to coat the gammon steaks
| Cook Sous-vide for 6 hours at 67\u00b0C [152.6\u00b0F]
| You could use the liquid for a sauce, but we found the steaks had enough flavour already.
| Discard the liquid and serve the gammon steaks
===Serving suggestions===
Serve with roast potatoes, cauliflower and carrots and a cheese sauce to pour over the vegetables.
===Variations===
This works equally well with the standard round 125g gammon steaks.
