Try this as a starter or a dip to serve with drinks.  Plain tortilla chips or toasted pitta strips make a great dip for this dish.   Make your own tortilla chips if you have the time.

===Ingredients===
| 4 fresh green chillies
| 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
| ½ red onion, peeled and finely chopped
| 2 fat cloves of Garlic
| 250 g strong cheddar cheese, grated
| 250 g Jarlsberg cheese or Gruyere cheese, grated
| 50 ml sour cream
| 150 ml double cream
| 2 large fresh tomatoes
| 15 ml Tequila
'''to serve '''
* 200g Plain tortilla chips or pitta strips

===Mise en place===
* Scorch the tomatoes and chillies and peel them using the technique shown here (for red peppers)
===Method===


| Rub the skins off the tomatoes and chillies - use rubber gloves if your skin is sensitive and don't run your eyes!
| Slice the tomatoes and chillies and scoop out and discard the seeds
| Cut the chillies and tomatoes into thin strips
| Heat the oil in a pan and gently fry the garlic and onions for 5 minutes until soft
| Turn down the heat and add the cheese, sour and double cream and stir until the cheese has melted and combined.
| Just before serving, mix in the tequila and add the tomato and chilli strips.
===Serving suggestions===
Serve warm with tortilla chips.

Try and use plain, unsalted tortilla chips as most commercial tortilla chips are coated with a disgusting powder that purports to be flavouring, which masks the delicious corn flavour. If you do,find them, let me know where you get them from!
===Variations===
Powder ¼ teaspoon dried oregano and ¼ teaspoon cumin seeds in a coffee grinder and sprinkle onto the surface before serving.

Sprinkle a little homemade Tex-Mex seasoning on the surface.
