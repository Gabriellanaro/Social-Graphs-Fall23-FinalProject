===Description===

[[Image:Popping corn.jpg|300px|thumb|right|75 g of popping corn]]
A typical Mexican snack.

===Ingredients===
| 30 ml vegetable oil
| 225 g popping corn
| 2 teaspoons chilli powder, as mild or as hot as you like
| 2 limes, squeezed
===Method===


| Heat the oil until its is hot.
| Add a couple of kernels and cover immediately with a lid.
| Once the corn pops, you know that the oil is at the correct temperature.
| Add the rest of the corn, cover immediately again and shake the pan from time to time to ensure even cooking.
| When the popping has ceased, remove from heat and keeping it covered, allow to cool a little.
| Remove any unpopped corn and discard.
| Add the chilli powder and shake the pan until the corn is coated in it.
| Pour into a bowl and squeeze over the lime juice just before serving.
===Variations===
Use lemon juice if preferred (or the juice of preserved lemons).  Any ground spices or spice mix may be substituted for the chilli powder.
===Chef's notes===
Do not be tempted to lift the saucepan lid which the corn is cooking.  It would also be advisable to wear oven gloves when adding the corn.
