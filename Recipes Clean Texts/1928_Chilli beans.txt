===Description===

Another vegetarian offering for our [http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2009/may/14/ghent-vegetarian-city-healthy-belgium Gent night].

This recipe is almost identical to '''The Fabulous Baker Brothers Beans recipe''' seen on Channel 4 recently.

===Ingredients===
| 30 ml (2 tablespoons) vegetable oil)
| 1 medium onion, peeled and finely chopped
| 3 cloves garlic, peeled and crushed
| ½ to 1 teaspoon chilli powder or to taste
| 1 x 400g (14 oz) can of plum tomatoes, chopped
| 142 ml (¼ pint) vegetable stock
| 1 teaspoon whole grain mustard
| 15 ml (1 tablespoons) black treacle or dark molasses
| 1 x 425 g (15 oz) can red kidney beans, rinsed and drained
| 1 x 425 g (15 oz) can black eye beans, rinsed and drained
| sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
| 1 tablespoon chopped parsley
'''to garnish'''
* 1 small red pepper or a few spring onions, chopped (optional)

===Method===


| Heat the oil in a pan, give it a good grind of black pepper and then saut\u00e9 the onion and garlic until it softens and starts to take some colour, about 5 minutes.
| Sprinkle the chilli powder over the onions and mix well.
| Add the tomatoes, stock, molasses, mustard and the beans.  Bring to the boil vigorously, uncovered for 15 minutes stirring now and then.  Simmer for longer if you want a thicker consistency.
| Add the chopped parsley , taste and adjust the seasoning if necessary.  Simmer for a further 5 minutes.
| Roast the red pepper, remove the seeds and pith and  chop into slices

===Serving suggestions===
Garnish with chopped red pepper, or spring onions and serve with bread or boiled rice.  The cold rice in moulds was an especially good contrast with this dish.
===Variations===
Use any variety of beans or pulses.  Chick peas are nice with this.
