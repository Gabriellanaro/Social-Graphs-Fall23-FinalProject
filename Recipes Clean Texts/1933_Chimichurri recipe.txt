===Description===

'''Chimichurri''' is a sauce and marinade for grilled meat originally from Argentina but used in countries as far north as Nicaragua.

Chimichurri (also spelled Chimmichurri) originated in Argentina and is a popular sauce used with grilled meat in many Latin American countries. It is told that the unusual name comes from 'Jimmy McCurry', an Irishman who is said to have first prepared the sauce. He was marching with the troops of General Jasson Ospina in the 19th Century, sympathetic to the cause of Argentine independence. The sauce was popular and the recipe was passed on. However, 'Jimmy McCurry' was difficult for the native people to say. Some sources claim Jimmy's sauce's name was corrupted to 'chimichurri', while others say it was changed in his honor.

'''Chimichurri''' can be used as a condiment or as a marinade for grilled meats.  It originates in South America and is frequently used in TexMex recipes.
