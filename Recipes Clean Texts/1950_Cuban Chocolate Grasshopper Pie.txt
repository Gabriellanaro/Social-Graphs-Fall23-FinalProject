The Judge 

Grasshopper pie is a rich minty dessert which originated from an after-dinner cocktail of the same name (a mix of cream, cr\u00e8me de cacao and cr\u00e8me de menthe, strained over ice).  This Cuban version includes Willie cacao ginger lime chocolate

===Ingredients===

| 80 ml Benjamin's burnt sugar
| 125 ml milk
| 160 grams mini marshmallows
| 1 jigger Cr\u00e8me de menthe
| 1 jigger Cr\u00e8me de cacao
| 365 ml double cream (heavy cream) whipped softly
| 150 grams Willie cacao ginger lime chocolate
| 500 g pre-baked pastry pie crust (one complete crust)

===Method===


| Melt the marshmallows in hot milk, let the mixture cool then add the alcohol
| Now fold in the whipped cream then add the chocolate pieces
| Pour into the pie shell
===Serving suggestions===
Sprinkle a dusting of cocoa on top.

Chill for a few hours and serve with a slice of lime.
===Variations===
Instead of the pre-baked pie shell, create a no-bake pastry case with Dulce de Leche wafers if you want a fancy sweet pastry shell. Just crumble the wafers into a pie dish and using the back of a spoon, press The the crumb mixture into place as a pie shell, cook for 5 minutes to harden and let it cool before filling.
