A tangy twist on the authentic Cuban Mojito, perfect for the Beach Hut!

===Ingredients===
| 10 mint leaves
| 1 lime, cut in wedges
| 2 tablespoons Natco mango pulp
| 1.5 jiggers rum
| 1 cup club soda
| 1 cup crushed ice
| 3 tablespoons sugar

===Method===

| Place mint leaves and 1 lime wedge into a sturdy glass.
| Use a muddler to crush the mint and lime to release the mint oils and lime juice.
| Add 2 more lime wedges and the sugar, and muddle again to release the lime juice.
| Do not strain the mixture. Fill the glass almost to the top with ice.
| Pour the rum and mango pulp over the ice, and fill the glass with carbonated water. Stir, taste, and add more sugar if desired.
| Garnish with the remaining lime wedge
