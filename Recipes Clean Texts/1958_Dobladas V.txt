===Method===

'''To make the tortillas:'''

| Mix the hot water with the masa harina - a food processor is ideal as the water should be very hot.
| Allow to cool and shape into 10 equal sized balls.
| Using a rolling pin or a tortilla press, shape into very thin disks.
| Heat a frying pan to a medium high temperature.
| Cook each tortilla on one side for 15 seconds.
| Turn and cook for 45 seconds.
| Turn again and cook for a further 15 seconds.
| They should have brown speckles.
| Reserve.
'''To make the dobladas:'''

| Heat some oil over a lowish heat in the same frying pan.
| Mix the filling ingredients together. 
| Place a tortilla in the pan and place some of the filling on one half of the tortilla.
| When the cheese has melted, fold the other half of the tortilla over the filling and serve.
===Serving suggestions===
These are normally served as a appetisers, allowing one per person, but would also make an excellent main course.  Nice served with a simple salad.
===Chef's notes===
I have not specified any quantities for the filling as I feel that it is down to your own individual preference.

If you don't have a tortilla press, use 2 chopping boards or just two sheets of wood as a substitute.  Place ball of dough between two non-stick surfaces such as small squares of Bake-O-Glide and stand on them!
