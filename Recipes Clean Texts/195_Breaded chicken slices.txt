[[Image:Pan frying chicken fried steak.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Pan frying one large chicken breast, thinly sliced]]
This recipe idea was passed to me by Maureen Cooper. It's an economical and fairly healthy way to use one chicken breast to serve two (or more) people.

In America I believe this is confusingly as ''Chicken Fried Steak''!
===Ingredients===

| 1 large chicken breast - if you can leave it partly frozen, it slices easily.
| 1 egg, beaten
| 6 tablespoons of Panko breadcrumbs - or make your own from leftover stale bread
| 1 teaspoon of dried rosemary
| sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
| 2 tablespoons of Olive oil
===Mise en place===

* Add 2 tbs of olive oil to a large frying pan and place over a medium heat

===Method===


|  
| One large chicken breast, leave part frozen so it slices easily and neatly.  Lay the chicken breast on a chopping board and put flat of hand on the top and carefully slice in slices just under 1cm thick.
| Beat the egg well and pour onto a small plate
| Mix the breadcrumbs, dried rosemary leaves, salt and black pepper together and tip onto another small plate.
| One by one, dip the slices in the egg mixture and then onto the breadcrumbs, pressing down so they stick well.
| Pop the breaded chicken slices into the hot pan and fry for a few minutes a side.
| Because the chicken is sliced so thinly, the chicken is cooked once the breadcrumbs are browned.
===Serving suggestions===
Serve with chips and salad or Mashed potato and vegetables.

Maureen especially likes the original Bisto gravy on hers!
