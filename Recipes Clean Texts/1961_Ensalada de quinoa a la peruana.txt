The Judge 

Grown in the Andes quinoa is a grain that was beloved by the Incas.  It can now be obtained in delicatessens and health food shops in the UK.  Supermarkets may well sell it too.  

'''Please read carefully the article about quinoa before making this recipe.'''

===Ingredients===
| 340 g quinoa
| 2 small sweet peppers, one each of red and yellow
| 3 celery sticks
| 1-2 green chillies, depending on size and strength
| 1 large Spanish onion
| 3 or more Cloves of garlic, according to size and taste
: The above vegetables should be quite finely diced or chopped.
* 50 ml corn or olive oil
* 1 tablespoon lemon juice

===Method===


| Take a pan of cold water and add the quinoa.  
| Bring to the boil, then simmer for around 10 minutes.
| Drain and squeeze as much water as you can out of the quinoa.
| Once cool, mix in a bowl with the vegetables.
| Shake the lemon and oil in a jar with a little seasoning and mix with the salad.
| Leave to chill for a short while.
===Serving suggestions===
Will go with anything really, but I like to serve it as part of a collection of salads, because the quinoa adds an extra texture.
===Variations===
You can add any vegetables, but try to keep it colourful,  Sometimes raisins are included.
===Chef's notes===
The easiest way, I find, to  squeeze the quinoa is to place it in either a jelly bag or butter muslin after draining.  Leave it for a while hanging over a bowl or sink and periodically squeeze the bag or muslin until you feel that you cannot extract any more water.
