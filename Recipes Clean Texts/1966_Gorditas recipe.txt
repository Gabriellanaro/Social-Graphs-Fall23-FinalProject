These are lovely.  You must make them with Masa Harina, they won't be the same using normal cornmeal.

===Description===

'''A gordita''' in Mexican cuisine is a food which is characterised by a small, thick tortilla made with masa harina (processed corn flour). The gordita is in contrast to a taco, which uses a thinner tortilla. \"Gordita\" means \"little fat one\" in Spanish. The gordita is typically baked on a comal, a small pan similar to a tava.

The gordita's thick tortilla is typically split and filled with guisos (soups or stews) or casseroles, like chicken, cochinita pibil, nopales, carne al pastor, etc. These are made mostly for lunch and are accompanied by many different types of salsas. The most traditional \"gordita\" in the central region of Mexico is filled with \"chicharr\u00f3n prensado\" (a type of stew made with pork rind and spices) and is called \"gordita de chicharr\u00f3n\".
In Durango, Mexico, gorditas are commonly made from wheat flour (harina de trigo) tortillas and look more like small pita breads. The dough (masa) is identical to that of the flour tortilla. It is cooked on a griddle (comal) with a hot piece of metal placed on top that resembles a clothes iron. The gordita fills up with steam and a small slit is cut into one side where it can be filled with guisados.

The best gorditas are made with masa harina, though you can make them with yellow cornmeal if you cannot obtain masa harina.

===Ingredients===
| 250g masa harina or fine yellow cornmeal
| ½ level teaspoon of sea salt
| 1 heaped teaspoon of baking powder
| 350 ml very hot water
| Yellow cornmeal for rolling
| Vegetable oil for frying
===Method===


| Add the masa and salt to a large bowl and make a well in the centre.
| Mix the baking powder into the hot water and pour into the centre of the masa.
| Using a spoon, fold the masa into the water, once it begins to combine, knead with your hands until a firm malleable dough is produced.
| Divide the dough into 12 balls, dust the work surface with cornmeal and roll each one out to about the size of a fried egg, leaving them quite thick.
| Heat a large frying pan and add a few glugs of oil
| Fill the pan with as many gorditas as will fit and fry for 3 minutes a side, turning once.  They are ready to eat once they have puffed up a little.
===Serving suggestions===
Slice them open like pitta breads and fill with Mexican treats
