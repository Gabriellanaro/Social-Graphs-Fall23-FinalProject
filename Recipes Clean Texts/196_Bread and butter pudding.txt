Not a fan of this I'm afraid.  Nasty stuff, made worse by custard!

[[Image:Bread and butter pudding ready to bake.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Bread and butter pudding, ready to bake]]
Another historic recipe for using up stale bread.  Unlike bread pudding, with which this is sometimes confused, this is better made with stale white bread.  This tangy version is quite a bit richer than the frugal original, probably Mrs Beeton's bread and butter pudding.

===Ingredients===
| 50 g (2 oz) butter
| 8 slices of stale white bread from a smallish loaf
| 50 g (2 oz) currants
| 10 g (1/2 oz) mixed candied peel
| grated zest from half a lemon
| 3 large eggs, beaten
| 60 ml (2.5 fl oz) double cream
| 275 ml (10 fl oz) full cream milk
| 50 g (2 oz) caster sugar
| Freshly grated nutmeg


===Mise en place===
* Preheat the oven to 180\u00b0 C (350\u00b0 F - gas 4)
===Method===


| Lightly grease a backing tray with butter.
| Leaving the crusts on, butter each slice of brad and cut into eight pieces.arrange a layer of bread and sprinkle with half of the currants and candied peel.
| Arrange the remaining bread and sprinkle with the remaining currants and peel.
| Add the double-cream ,milk, sugar, lemon zest and beaten eggs to a bowl and whisk together well.
| Pour this mixture over the layered bread, sprinkle with a little freshly grated nutmeg and bake for 40 minutes.
