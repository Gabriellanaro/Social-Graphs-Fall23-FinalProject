===Description===

An first course from Peru, which I think would also make an unusual breakfast dish.

===Ingredients===
| 480 ml vegetable stock
| 240 ml dry white wine 
| 2 slices of lime, minus the peel
| Garlic to taste, peeled and left whole
| A pinch of nutmeg
| 2 sprigs of parsley
| 2 carrots, peeled and chopped
| 1 medium onion, chopped
| Salt
| 6 peppercorns
| 4 hard-boiled eggs
| 1 tablespoon dijon mustard
| 60 g butter
| Finely chopped parsley to garnish
===Method===


| Put the stock in a pan, heat it and add the wine, lime, garlic, nutmeg, parsley, carrots, onion, salt and peppercorns. 
| Cook over a medium heat until the liquid is reduced to 120 ml - about 30 minutes.
| Cut the eggs in half and arrange on plates or a serving dish.
| Add the mustard and butter to the sauce, beating vigorously and pour over the eggs.
| Garnish with the chopped parsley.
===Serving suggestions===
Serve with little squares of fried bread.
