===Description===

An unusual tamales recipe from Chiclayo which is the capital city of the Lambayeque region in northern Peru.

'''For the corn'''
===Ingredients===
| 900 g sweetcorn
| 15 ml corn oil
| 1 teaspoon achiote granules, dissolved in 10 ml hot corn oil
| 1 teaspoon salt
| Pinch of pepper
'''For the humitas'''
===Ingredients===NB
| 20 corn husks
| 1 dried yellow aj\u00ed pepper, rehydrated in hot water and sliced into 10 pieces
| 10 black olives, cut in half
| 1 small onion, finely sliced
| Â¼ teaspoon achiote granules, dissolved in 5 ml hot corn oil
| Pinch of salt
| 450 g skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cut into ten pieces
| 2 Eggs, hard-boiled, peeled and cut into 10 slices each
| Nylon thread or raffia
===Method===

'''For the corn:'''

| Blend the sweetcorn into a rough mash.
| Place in a bowl and mix in the remaining corn ingredients.
| Leave for at least 30 minutes to thicken.
'''For the humitas:'''

| Take 2 corn husks and lay them so that half of one lies on the half of the other.
| Place 2 good tablespoons of the corn mixture in the centre of the husks.
| To a small frying pan, on a low heat, add the aj\u00ed, olives, onion, achiote oil and salt.
| Fry, stirring constantly, for a couple of minutes.
| Remove from heat and allow to cool.
| For each humita, make a dent in the centre of the corn mix and add 1 chicken piece and one slice of egg.
| From the fried mixture, add a slice of aj\u00ed, 2 olive halves and a few onion slices.
| Put a further 2 tablespoons of the corn mixture on the top and press the whole thing into a rectangle.
| Fold one corn husk over the mixture and the other husk over that.
| Tie one of the open ends with the nylon thread or raffia, about 5 cm from the end.
| Do the same with the other end and wrap the humita lengthwise with the thread.
| When all of the humitas have been made, place them in a wide pan (or two separate ones) so that they all lie on the base of the pan.
| Add enough hot water to just cover the humitas, cover, and boil for 20 minutes.
| Unfold the humitas and serve warm.
===Chef's notes===
Corn husks can be obtained from '''Cool Chile Co''' and yellow (amarillo) aj\u00ed chillies are sold by '''[http://www.southdevonchillifarm.co.uk/shop/index.php?target=products&product_id=158 The South Devon Chilli Farm]'''
