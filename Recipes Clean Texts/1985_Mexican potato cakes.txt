Marvellous Masa!

The special flavour imparted by the masa is so reminiscent of Mexican cookery

===Description===

When these pancakes are made large they are good as a main course, topped with spicy chicken & sour cream, grilled cheese, guacamole, grilled vegetables, refried beans, ceviche, etc. Make lots of small ones as finger food or starters.

===Ingredients===
| 4 medium potatoes
| 160g masa harina
| 1 small onion, peeled and grated
| 1 Clove of garlic, peeled and crushed
| 200g Cheddar cheese
| Pinch of chilli powder
| sea salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
| Vegetable oil for frying


===Mise en place===
* Boil the potatoes, whole, in their skins until cooked, rub the skins off and mash them.
* Grate the cheese and onion
===Method===


| Add all of the ingredients to a food processor with a dough hook or a plastic blade and knead into a fairly firm dough, add a little water or more masa harina to adjust the consistency
| Rest for 30 minutes then roll out into 1 cm thick pancakes
| Shallow fry in oil until golden brown and crispy, turning now and again.

===Chef's notes===
Making this (for about 8 people), I used about 200 g masa harina and 800 g desire potatoes, weighed after boiling and peeling.  A dusting of yellow cornmeal makes them easy to roll and a nice finish.

The mixture kept well for 4 days, refrigerated in a Lock&Lock box and made really nice sized nibbles by rolling into balls (golf-ball sized), pressing in a tortilla-press then shallow-frying.

If you don't have a tortilla press, use 2 chopping boards or just two sheets of wood as a substitute.  Place ball of dough between two non-stick surfaces such as small squares of Bake-O-Glide and stand on them!
