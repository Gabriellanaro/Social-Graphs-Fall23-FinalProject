Recipe for deep fried mozzarella bites, a great starter or just a tasty snack.

===Ingredients===

| 113g (\u00bc pound) mozzarella cheese, drained
| 118 ml (\u00bd cup) seasoned bread crumbs
| 1 large egg
===Mise en place===

* Preheat deep fat fryer to 175\u00b0C (350\u00b0F)

===Method===


| Preheat deep fryer to 350\u00b0F (175\u00b0C).
| Slice mozzarella into cubes 2-3 cm on a side.
| In a small bowl, whisk egg.
| Fill another small bowl with bread crumbs.
| Dip 5-6 bites at a time into the egg.
| Shake excess egg off the bites and place them in the bread crumbs.
| Shake bowl of bread crumbs, evenly coating all bites. Add more bread crumbs as needed.
| Place coated bites to the side and repeat for remaining bites.
| After all bites have been coated, repeat the egg-dip and crumb-coat for each once more.
| Place all bites in fryer basket and submerge in 175\u00b0C oil.
| Let sit for 30 seconds, gently rocking basket occasionally.
| Lift basket and let cool for a few seconds. If cheese is not beginning to ooze out from half the sticks, re-submerge in oil for another 10-15 seconds, gently shaking the basket. Repeat until the cheese is just starting to ooze out.
| Dump onto paper towel and pat off excess oil gently.
