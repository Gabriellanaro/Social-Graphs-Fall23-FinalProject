Cheddar is good too.

Here in the UK, Monterey Jack is not a thing, however, Cheddar Cheese is just as good in this fine recipe.

===Description===

A rich dish from Colombia.
, ''see comments''

===Ingredients===
| 1 kg potatoes 
| 40g butter
| 1 green chilli, finely chopped
| 1 red chilli, finely chopped

===Method===


| Peel and boil the potatoes.
| Heat the oil in a pan and gently fry the chillies and onions until the latter are soft.  
| Add the tomatoes and wine cook for a further 5 minutes or so until the sauce has reduced.
| Stir in the cheese and the cream and cook until the cheese has melted slightly.
| Season to taste.
| Serve the potatoes and pour the sauce over them.
===Serving suggestions===
Good with salad or meat or just as a snack.
===Variations===
If liked, add finely diced or crushed garlic when frying the onions.

Next day, the leftovers were mashed and grilled in an oven proof dish so the top was browned and crunchy, delicious. 
===Chef's notes===
I would recommend a softish cheese such as Port Salut or Tetilla.
