| 1 teaspoon sugar
| 1 tablespoon lime juice
| 1 tablespoon olive oil
===Method===


| Heat a heavy based fring pan and dry-fry the seeds until they start to brown.  Shimmy the pan `chef-style' to keep them from burning
| Add the olive oil and garlic and heat just to take the raw edge off the garlic
