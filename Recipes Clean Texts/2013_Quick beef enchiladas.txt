One of the best, and one of the easiest Mexican-ish meals you can make.

===Description===

This recipe is a beef version of my Cheatin' chicken enchiladas.

I've used my homemade Tex mex seasoning but you could use a packet of commercial taco seasoning.  I've deliberately not used a spicy sauce as the contrast between the spicy beef and the tomato soup might be interesting.

===Ingredients===
| 250 g beef mince (''ground beef'')
| 600g pot of tomato and basil soup
| 150 g Cheddar cheese, grated
| 1 stick of celery, chopped into thin crescents ''(half moons)''
| 6 spring onions (scallions), chopped finely
| 300g of cooked kidney beans
| 2 tablespoons garlic olive oil or olive oil and 1 garlic clove, crushed
| 1 green bell pepper, sliced
| 8 flour or corn tortillas


===Mise en place=== 
* Preheat the oven to 180\u00b0 C (350\u00b0 F - Gas 4)

===Method===


| In a wok or frying pan, heat the garlic olive oil gently and fry the minced beef, celery and the green peppers for about 5 minutes.
| Add the beans and taco seasoning and mix well.
| Remove from the heat and drain any excess liquid.  You don't want the mixture too wet.
| Mix in the spring onions
| Divide the mix into eight portions and roll up in the tortillas
| Place in an oven proof dish
| Pour the soup over the tortillas and gently move them around so the soup fills all the gaps
| Sprinkle with the cheese
| Bake for 30 minutes
===Serving suggestions===
Serve with sour cream and finely chopped chillies!
===Variations===
Any interesting soup will do. You could use or 568 lm (1 pint) strong beef stock, thickened with flour or cornflour
===Chef's noites===
I chop and freeze leftover celery before it goes soft so I've always got a little spare
