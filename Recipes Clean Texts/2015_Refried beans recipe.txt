Fresher and not at all cloying or gloopy (which the tinned stuff is!)

Refried beans are the essential ingredient for Mexican and Tex-Mex dishes.  They are ideal for freezing.

===Ingredients===
| 500g (1lb 2oz) dried pinto beans
| 1.2 litres (2 pints) water
| 1 large onion, chopped
| 250g (9oz) smoked streaky bacon, finely chopped
| 1 small fresh red chili, deseeded and finely chopped
| 2 tablespoons olive oil
| knob of butter
===Method===


| Soak the beans overnight in plenty of water.  Drain and re-rinse.
| Boil the beans in 1.2 litres (2 pints) of water boil until tender. Reserve the cooking water.
| In a large frying pan or wok, heat the oil and butter and fry the the onion until soft.
| Add the bacon and fry it until cooked, but not crispy.
| Mash the beans, a potato ricer or masher is good for this,  then mix them with the fried bacon and onion.
| Stir in a little of the reserved cooking water so the beans are the same consistency as double cream.
