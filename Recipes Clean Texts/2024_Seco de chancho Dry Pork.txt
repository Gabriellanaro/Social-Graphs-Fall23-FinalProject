===Description===

This is a pork stew from Ecuador.

===Ingredients===
| 30ml annatto oil or lard
| 1.35kg lean shoulder of pork, cut into 5cm cubes
| 1 large onion, finely chopped
| Garlic to taste, crushed
| 1 large tomato, peeled, seeded and chopped
| 1 red pepper, seeded and roughly chopped
| Chillies to taste, finely chopped
| 1 tablespoon coriander leaves, roughly chopped
| ½ teaspoon ground cumin
| ½ teaspoon dried oregano
| Salt and pepper
| Pinch sugar
| 425ml lager
===Method===


| Heat the oil or lard in a heavy frying pan.
| Add the pork and lightly saut\u00e9.
| Remove the pork to a flameproof casserole or sauteuse.
| Drain off all but 2 tablespoons of fat from the frying pan and add the onion and garlic.
| Saut\u00e9 until the onion is soft.
| Add the tomato, red pepper, chillies, coriander, cumin and oregano and simmer  for about 10 minutes.
| Season to taste and add the sugar.
| Pour this mixture over the pork and add the beer.
| Cover and cook over a very low heat until the pork is tender, about 2 hours.
| The sauce should be quite thick, but if it is too watery, partially uncover during the second hour of cooking.
===Serving suggestions===
Serve with rice.
===Chef's notes===
Follow the RSPCA Think Pig Checklist to make sure that your pork has come from pigs that have been reared to higher welfare standards.
