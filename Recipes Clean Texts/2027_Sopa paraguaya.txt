Although this literally means 'Paraguayan soup', this is in fact a type of bread made with cornmeal and cheese.

===Ingredients===
| 115g butter
| 2 medium onions, finely chopped
| 225g cottage cheese
| 225g Cheddar cheese, grated
| 225g cornmeal
| 340g sweetcorn, pulverised
| 1 teaspoon coarse salt
| 280ml milk
| 6 eggs separated


===Mise en place===
* Preheat the oven to 200\u00b0 C (400\u00b0 F - gas 6), [fan oven 180\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]
===Method===


| Grease a baking tin measuring about 25cm x 32cm.
| Heat half of the butter and saut\u00e9 the onions until they are softened and set aside.
| Cream the remaining butter and add to the cottage cheese, blending thoroughly.
| Add the Cheddar cheese and the onions.
| In another bowl combine the cornmeal, sweetcorn, salt and milk and mix thoroughly.
| Combine the corn mixture with the cheese mixture, blending thoroughly.
| Beat the egg white until they form soft peaks and beat the yolks separately.
| Combine the two and fold them into the cornmeal and cheese mixture.
| Pour the batter into the baking tin and bake for about 45 minutes.
| Whilst still warm, cut the bread into squares and allow to cool on a wire rack.
===Serving suggestions===
Serve on its own, or with meat and poultry dishes.  It is the traditional accompaniment to So'o-yosopy.
===Variations===
You can add a further 60g finely cubed Cheddar into the mixture at the last moment to give the bread a lightly different texture.  You could also use Parmesan if you want a cheesier flavour.
