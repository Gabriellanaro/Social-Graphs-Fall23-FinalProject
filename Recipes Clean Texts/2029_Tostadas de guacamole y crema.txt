Tostadas de guacamole y crema: ''guacamole sour cream tostadas''.

This recipe is an anglicised version of a recipe by Diana Kennedy, 'Tostadas de guacamole y crema' from her brilliant Mexican cookery bible: ''The essential cuisines of Mexico'' ISBN 9780307587725 - mine was about \u00a37 from Amazon and it's looking to be the best cook-book I own!

===Ingredients===
| Vegetable (Rapeseed oil for frying)
| 12 cornmeal tortillas
| 225 g (8 oz) good quality medium strength Cheddar - the more acidic the better - cut into thin slices
| 500 ml guacamole
| 250 ml sour cream
| 375 ml finely shredded lettuce
| 4 to 6 heaped tablespoons of sliced pickled jalapeno chillies (red or green)
===Method===


| Heat the oil in a large heavy based frying pan and fry the tortillas until crisp - drain on paper towels
| Layer the fried tortillas with the sliced cheese and top with a big spoonful of guacamole and top with soured cream
| Sprinkle with shredded lettuce and chillies
===Serving suggestions===
