===Ingredients===
| 1 tablespoon olive oil
| 2 tablespoons butter
| 1 kg British onions, finely sliced
| A few sprigs of thyme
| 2 bay leaves
| 300ml dark ale
| 1 litre beef stock, fresh if you can get it

* 100g mature cheddar
* ½ teaspoon British mustard

* A couple of dashes of Worcestershire sauce
* 1 tablespoon dark ale
* Salt and pepper
* 8 slices of sourdough or white baguette

===Method===


| Heat the oil and butter in a large heavy bottomed pan. 
| Add the onions and cook on a really low heat, uncovered for 40 minutes or until the onions are sticky and caramelized. 
| Pour over the ale and reduce by half. 
| Add the stock and bring to the boil. 
| Cook for 30 minutes.
| Heat the grill on high. 
| To make the Welsh rarebit toasts, mix together the cheese, mustard, egg, Worcestershire sauce, ale and salt and pepper. 
| Grill the slices of bread on one side. 
| Sprinkle the cheese mixture between each of the toasts on the un-toasted side.
| Pour the soups between 4 bowls.
