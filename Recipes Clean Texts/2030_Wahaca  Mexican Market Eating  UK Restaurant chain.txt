|description=My review of the fantastic Wahaca, Mexican Market Eating chain after a recent visit to the Covent Garden Restaurant

__NOTOC__
==Wahaca - Mexican Market Eating - UK Restaurant chain==
I love Mexican food and I think this is the best British Mexican restaurant chain I've been to in a very long while.  If the name already rings a bell, it's probably because you've seen Wahaca's co-founder, Cheltenham born Thomasina Miers on Channel 5's ''Mexican Food Made Simple'' tv cookery program or maybe you remember her as BBC 2's 2005 ''Masterchef'' winner.

We popped in for a light early evening meal and were instantly impressed.  It has the ''cool'' buzz that I remember from Bob Payton's ''Chicago Pizza Pie Factory'' way back in the 80's.  When we left it even had the matching hoards of people queuing down the stairs to get a table.

For under \u00a320 we had the Wahaca Street Food Selection for 2 people: 3 pork pibil tacos, 3 winter vegetable tacos, 1 large huitlacoche quesadilla, 2 black bean tostadas and 2 chicken taquitos with green rice & black beans.  My favourite way to eat, lots of little portions of different flavoured dishes, which you can eat with your fingers. Unlike some British Mexican restaurant offerings that appear to come straight from the microwave or the deep fat frier, these were cooked to order and packed with fresh vegetables.  Oh and don't forget the mandatory selection of hot sauces on your table.

Built from 8 recycled shipping containers!

The decor was cleverly done, it was only as we left, I remembered we had actually been in a windowless basement.  The service was impeccable and everyone was was extremely helpful.  A very slick operation that has been replicated in 11 locations in the South East, 13 if you count the 2 Mexican Mobile Eating vans. Congratulations Tommi, I'm already planning another excuse to get back into London for another Mexican feast!

''Update:'' In the short time since this article was written, we've been to even more Wahaca locations, every time the food and service has been exemplary.  Our last visit, to the South bank Experiment, deserves a special mention.  The restaurant overlooks the river, being situated on a the first floor terrace of the 1950's minimalist building, The Queen Elizabeth Hall, which sits between The Royal Festival Hall and The Hayward Gallery. The 'South Bank Experiment' is so named because of the restaurants unique construction materials. 8 recycled shipping containers!  Now that's what I call recycling.  It also affords wonderful views of the river and should you want to eat on the move, the mobile eating truck is at river level in front of the restaurant.
