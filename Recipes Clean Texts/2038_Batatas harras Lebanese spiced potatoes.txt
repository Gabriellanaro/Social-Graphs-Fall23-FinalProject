===Description===

Chunks of potatoes, fried with garlic, chilli and coriander leaves.

===Ingredients===
| 900 g potatoes, peeled and chopped into small chunks
| 160 ml olive oil
| garlic to taste, peeled and sliced
| Fresh chillies to taste, finely chopped
| Salt
|  coriander leaves to taste, finely chopped
===Method===


| Heat the oil in a deep frying pan and add the potatoes.
| Cook over a medium heat and when they are soft, add the garlic and chillies.
| Cook for a few minutes until the garlic is golden.
| Add salt to taste.
| Mix in the chopped coriander, stir and serve.
===Serving suggestions===
They will go with practically any Lebanese dish, but I also like them on their own as a snack or even for breakfast!
===Variations===
If you are unable to find the sort of chillies you want, you can use dried flakes instead.
===Chef's notes===
It is difficult to judge the amount of chilli to use, so you must try to work out for yourself how much you need.  The norm would be about 3 medium strength chillies.  I never bother removing the seeds.  Avoid using chilli powder for this recipe if possible.
