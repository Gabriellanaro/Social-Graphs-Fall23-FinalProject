===Description===

A zingy way to warm up your greens

===Ingredients===

| 500ml veg stock
| 1 floury potato, peeled and diced
| A splash of olive oil
| 1 onion, finely chopped
| sea salt and freshly ground pepper
| 2 garlic cloves, finely chopped
| \u00bd red chilli, finely chopped (more or less, to taste)
| 1 orange, zest and juice
| 1 head of broccoli, finely chopped

===Method===


| Bring your stock to the boil. Add the potato. Lower heat to a rolling simmer. Add a splash of oil to a hot frying pan. Add the onion in with a pinch of salt and pepper. Lower heat.
| Sizzle till tender. Mix in the garlic and chilli. Cook till softened. Add the orange zest and juice. Let the juice reduce down till it\u0092s almost a sticky glaze. Take off heat.
| When the potato\u0092s cooked, add the broccoli to the pot. Cook till just tender.
| Spoon a bit of stock into the orangey/onion pan to loosen the mix. Pop it in a food processor, along with the broccoli, potato and most of the stock. Whizz till smooth. Add more stock as needed to reach desired consistency.
| Taste. Add more orange or chilli, if you like.
===Serving suggestions===
Delicious with a few almonds fried in a little olive oil scattered on top.
