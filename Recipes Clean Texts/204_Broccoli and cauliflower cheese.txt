Farb easy and it goes with anything (or on it's own)

===Description===

One of my favourite vegetable dishes that goes well with almost anything.  Whilst you could add extra cheese and grill to finish, as a vegetable accompaniment, I don't think it needs that.  If you were having this alone, then maybe

===Ingredients===
| ½ pint of cheese sauce
| 300 g (11 oz) broccoli and cauliflower, trimmed and cut to florets.  Most supermarkets sell these ready prepared, lazy and handy!
| Nutmeg (optional)
| Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
===Method===


| Cut an x in the base of any thick stalks so they cook evenly
| Add the broccoli and cauliflower to a large pan of boiling, lightly salted water and simmer hard for about 10 minutes, depending how you prefer your vegetables cooked
| Meanwhile make the cheese sauce as shown here
| Drain the broccoli and cauliflower and pour the cheese sauce over the vegetables, mixing well
===Serving suggestions===

Serve hot, sprinkled with grated nutmeg if liked

===Variations===

Top with a little extra cheese and brown under a grill
