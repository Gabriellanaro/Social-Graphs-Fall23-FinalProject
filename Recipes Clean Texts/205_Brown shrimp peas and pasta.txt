===Description===

This recipe is surprisingly good.  The mint seems an odd herb to accompany seafood and garlic but it worked really well.

Use the small peeled Brown shrimp that are more often sold by specialist suppliers, sea-front stalls and fishmongers than they are in supermarkets.  Well worth hunting out.
  
Home made pasta is the best to go with this dish. Do try it, you don't even need a pasta machine.  Just roll it our flat and cut into rough strips with a knife.

===Ingredients===
| 2 portions of Home made pasta or fresh pasta, rolled flat and cut into rough rustic strips
| ''OR'' 300g dried tagliatelle
| 300g small brown shrimp
| 500 g frozen peas
| 4 cloves of Garlic, peeled and crushed
| 2 tablespoons finely chopped mint leaves
| Juice from 1 lemon
| 3 tablespoons of butter or a mixture of butter and olive oil for the more health conscious. 
| Salt and freshly ground black pepper

===Method===


| Melt half of the butter in a pan, add the garlic and gently saut\u00e9 until soft, don't allow it to burn or colour.
| Add the shrimps, half of the lemon juice and season with salt, pepper. Stir well to mix and then remove from the heat.
| Meanwhile cook the peas until tender, either by microwaving or boiling - about 4 minutes
| Cook the tagliatelle in salted boiling water until al dente
| Drain the pasta and add to the shrimps, Stir in the remaining lemon juice, butter and peas. Mix well, season and serve.
