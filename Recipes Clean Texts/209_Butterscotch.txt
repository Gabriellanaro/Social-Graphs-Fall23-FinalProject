Butterscotch is a type of confectionery made by boiling sugar syrup, butter, cream, and vanilla. The ingredients for butterscotch are similar to toffee; the major difference is that the sugar is boiled to the soft crack stage for butterscotch and the hard crack stage for toffee. Butterscotch sauce is often made into a syrup, which is used as a topping for ice cream (particularly sundaes).

A jam making or sugar thermometer is required for this recipe.

===Ingredients===
| 450 g (1 lb) of granulated sugar
| 150 ml (1/4 pint) of water
| 90 g (3 oz) butter, preferably unsalted
| 1 teaspoon lemon juice
| ¼ teaspoon cream of tartar
| ¼ teaspoon vanilla essence or vanilla extract
| A little oil for greasing
===Method===


| Grease a shallow 28 cm x 18 cm (11\" x 7\") baking tray
| Add the water and lemon juice to a heavy-based pan and warm on a low heat
| Add the sugar and stir until it has completely dissolved.  Don't allow it to boil!
| Mix in the cream of tartar
| Heat to 115\u00b0 C (239\u00b0 F) then immediately remove from the heat
| Add the butter and mix well
| Return to the heat and heat to 138\u00b0 C (280\u00b0 F)
| Remove from the heat and mix in the vanilla essence
| Pour into the greased tray and leave to set.  Before the butterscotch cools completely, score it into bite-sized squares
| When it is totally cold you can snap it into pieces
| Store in an airtight container
