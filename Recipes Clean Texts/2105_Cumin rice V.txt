===Description===

Another flavoured rice dish that is very simple to make.

===Ingredients===
| 1 cup of basmati rice
| 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil
| 1 large onion, peeled and finely chopped
| 2 teaspoons of white cumin seeds
| Chopped coriander leaves to garnish


===Mise en place===
*Rinse the rice in a sieve under cold running water, stirring with your hands until the water runs clear.
*Drain well
===Method===


| Cook the rice in lots of boiling water until the rice is soft on the outside but still has a tiny bite to it.  About 11 to 12 minutes
| Remove from the heat and drain in a sieve
| Meanwhile, add the oil and onions to a large pan and saut\u00e9 until they just turn brown.
| Stir in the cumin seeds.
| Once they start to pop, stir in the rice.
| Add half a cup of boiling water, cover with a lid, placing a cloth between the pan and the lid being careful not to catch it alight!
| Simmer gently for a further 5 minutes then remove from the heat and let it stand for 7 minutes so all of the water is absorbed
===Serving suggestions===
Serve garnished with chopped coriander leaves
