The trick is using the pressure cooker

===Description===


This recipe requires partial use of a pressure cooker.  Ideally, this should be made a day or two before you want to eat it, so that the flavours can develop more.

'''For the kidney beans'''
===Ingredients===
| 50g salt dissolved in 500ml tap water
| 150g dried kidney beans
| 500g cherry tomatoes
'''For the chilli'''
===Ingredients===NB
| Olive oil
| 450g minced beef
| 1 large onion, peeled and diced
| 2 star anise
| 1 large carrot, peeled and diced
| Garlic to taste, finely chopped
| Green chillies to taste, chopped (remove seeds if desired, but personally I don't bother)
| 30g tomato pur\u00e9e
| 375ml red wine
| 50g Heston's spiced butter
| 3 medium tomatoes, diced
| 500ml beef stock
'''To finish and serve'''
===Ingredients===NB
| 2 red peppers, de-seeded, roasted and peeled
| Seasoning


===Mise en place===
* Put the brine (salt and water mixture) in the bowl with the beans. 
* Cover and refrigerate for 12 hours
===Method===


| Put the tomatoes and 50g water into a pressure cooker
| Put on the lid, bring to pressure over a high heat, reduce heat and cook for 20minutes
| Remove from the heat and allow to cool before opening the lid
| Put the pan on a high heat, stirring frequently until the liquid is reduced by half - about 10 minutes
| Drain the kidney beans and add to the pan.
| Add enough water to cover the beans if necessary.
| Replace the lid and bring up to pressure over a high heat.
| Reduce and heat and cook for 20 minutes.
| Leave the mixture until completely before opening.
| Meanwhile, to start the chilli, coat the bottom of a large pan with olive oil and place over a high heat until smoking.
| Add the mince, in batches if necessary, so that it browns rather than stews.
| Remove and drain the meat.
| Add a little water to the pan to deglaze it, and tip the water and bits in with the drained meat.
| Reduce the heat to medium-high and thinly coat with another layer of oil.
| Add the onion and the star anise and cook for 7-10 minutes until the onion begins to colour.
| Add the carrot, garlic and green chillies and cook for another 10 minutes or until the carrot is soft.
| Add the tomato pur\u00e9e, stir and cook for another 5 minutes until everything turns a brick-red colour.
| Pour in the red wine and allow to reduce by two thirds.
| Remove the star anise and discard.
| Stir in the spiced butter, the mince, diced tomatoes and stock and simmer over a low heat for 2-3 hours, stirring occasionally.
| To finish, fold the beans and chopped peppers into the chilli and bring to a simmer.
| Season and stir in more spiced butter to increase the heat.
===Serving suggestions===
Serve with rice, or grated cheese and sour cream

===Chef's notes===
My husband felt that it needed 5 chillies, rather than 2.  Also there was too much liquid, possibly caused by the fact that during simmering, it was covered for most of the time.
