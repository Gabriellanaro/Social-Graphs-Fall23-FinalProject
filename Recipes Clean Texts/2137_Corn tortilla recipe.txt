Pretty good attempt

4.5
/5 

Not bad.  Never as good as the pre-made ones, which seem to hold up better.  These taste really good though. Probably because there are no 'other' ingredients.

These delicious corn tortillas are easy to make, though best made with a tortilla press if you can get hold of one.

You '''must''' use masa harina as cornmeal will not work.

===Ingredients===
| 250g masa harina
| 330 ml hot water
| 1/2 a teaspoon of table salt
===Method===

| Mix the salt, masa harina and half of the water together to form a dough
| Add more water as required - you are looking for a stiff, pliable dough
| This can be done in a food processor or even better, use a breadmaker on dough setting.  The Panasonic SD 253 and similar models have a 45 minute pizza dough setting that is perfect for tortilla dough.
| Rest for at least 1 hour then shape into 10 equal sized balls.
| Using a tortilla press or rolling pin, place a ball of dough between two non-stick sheets (Bake-O-Glideor similar) and press into shape
| Heat a frying pan to a medium high temperature (but with no oil).
| Cook each tortilla on one side for 15 seconds.
| Turn and cook for 45 seconds.
| Turn again and cook for a further 15 seconds.
| They should have brown speckles.
===Serving suggestion===

Can be eaten as they are, fried, wrapped around beans, salad, chicken, cheese etc.

Use as suggested in your recipe
*Make Cheese pupusas or Dobladas with your homemade maize tortillas
===Variations===

Add 1-2 teaspoons chilli powder and/or 2-3 teaspoons garlic powder to the mixture.

===Chef's note===

If you don't have a tortilla press, use 2 chopping boards or just two sheets of wood as a substitute.  Place ball of dough between two non-stick surfaces such as small squares of Bake-O-Glide and stand on them!
