Can't find this anywhere, so I have to make it myself - this works well for me.

A quesadilla is a dish in Mexican cuisine where cheese is placed on a cooking wheat or corn flour tortilla and then folded over and cooked until the cheese melts. These would go really well with our  Mango salsa

Quesadillas are similar to the dish from San Salvador; pupusas

===Ingredients===
| 450 g (1 lb) fresh crabmeat
| 1 packet of flour tortillas 
| 1 red sweet pepper, cut into thin strips 
| 1 green sweet pepper, cut into thin strips 
| Â½ a red onion, peeled and thinly sliced
| 1 tablespoon olive oil 
| 225 g (8 oz) mascarpone cheese 
| A good pinch of chilli powder 
| Good handful of coriander leaves, finely chopped
| 1 cup grated cheddar cheese
| Cooking oil spray, I prefer olive oil for health reasons


===Mise en place===
* Preheat the oven to 230 \u00b0C (450 \u00b0F - Gas 8)

===Method===


| Heat the olive oil in a frying pan
| Add the onions and peppers and fry until the onions are translucent 
| Meanwhile, into a large bowl, sift the crabmeat and remove any shell fragments
| Stir the mascarpone cheese into the crabmeat, add the coriander and chilli powder and mix well 
| Spray half of the tortillas with cooking spray. Lay them oil side down on baking sheets 
| Add equal portions of the crabmeat and then onions and peppers
| Sprinkle with the Cheddar cheese
| Place the remaining tortillas on top and spray with cooking spray 
| Bake for about 10 minutes or until golden brown
| Rest for 3 minutes then cut into quarters and serve
===Serving suggestions===
