Especially as it doesn't melt too much, like some cheeses

[[Image:Cambozola mushroom burgers ready to cook.jpg|thumb|right|Two mushroom burgers ready to air-fry. One burger lifted on one to show the preparation.]]
A lovely easy recipe that's oddly different and very tasty.

We use our local butcher, Russell's steak burgers, but any good quality ¼ pounder burger will work well.

The orange pepper happened to be a left over so we added that for a little extra colour.

We cooked these in our air-fryer, but a conventional oven will do just as well.

===Ingredients===

| sea salt & freshly ground black pepper
| 2 large portobello mushrooms, stems removed
| 1 medium red onion, finely chopped
| 1 large clove of garlic, finely chopped
| 1 teaspoon olive oil
| 2 50g slices of cambozola cheese
| 2 ¼ pounder beef burgers or preferably 2 Russell's of Upwell steakburgers
===Mise en place===

* Preheat your oven to 180\u00b0 C (350\u00b0 F - gas 4), [fan oven 160\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]

===Method===


| Chop the onions and garlic very finely
| Season with salt and pepper
| Add the olive oil and mix well
| Remove the stems of the mushrooms to make a little more room
| Spoon the onion mix into the mushrooms
| Top each mushroom with a slice of cambozola
| Pop a beef burger on top of each mushroom
| Oven bake for about 15 minutes at 180\u00b0 C
| Leave to rest for 5 minutes then serve

===Serving suggestions===
Serve with curly fries, onion rings and tomatoes
===Variations===
Use stilton cheese for a nice change
