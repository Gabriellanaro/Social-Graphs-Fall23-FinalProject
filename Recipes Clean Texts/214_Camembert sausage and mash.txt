===Description===

I had seen somewhere, a recipe with sausages and Camembert cheese.  I 'invented' this recipe using what was in the pantry at the time.  Here is my sausage and cheese bake.

It was a great success.
===Ingredients===

| 2 large potatoes
| 1 tablespoon olive oil
| 1 large onion
| 4 cloves of garlic
| 1 teaspoon dried parsley
| 4 tablespoons of sour cream
| Good pinch of freshly ground black pepper
| 250 g pork sausage meat
| 2 small triangles of Camembert cheese
| 8 cherry tomatoes
===Mise en place===

* Preheat your oven to 220\u00b0 C (425\u00b0 F - gas 7), [fan oven 200\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]

===Method===


| Peel the potatoes, cut into smaller pieces and boil for 15 minutes or until soft
| Meanwhile peel and slice the onions and garlic and fry in the olive oil, with the black pepper for about 10 minutes or until softened
| Add the sour cream and parsley to the potatoes and mash well
| Mix the fried onions and garlic into the mash
| Lightly oil a baking tray and spread the mash thinly so that it can crisp slightly while cooking
| Make thin 'burgers' with the sausage meat, lay over the mash and top with the Camembert cheese
| Surround with sliced tomatoes and cook in the oven for 35 to 45 minutes

===Variations===
I added 2 tbs of Taste Sensation Mixed Sweet Red and Green Bell Pepper Granules to the mash for a bit of colour and extra flavour.
