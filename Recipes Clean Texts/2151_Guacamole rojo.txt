This is a nice as a dip for pitta breads

This is red guacamole, so called because of the large amount of tomatoes used in it.  Because of its coarse texture, it is more suited as an accompaniment than a dip.

The recipe has been translated and slightly adapted from Ricardo Mu\u00f1oz Zurita's book '''Salsas Mexicanas''' (ISBN 9702222125)

===Ingredients===
| 600g ripe tomatoes, cut into 0.5cm cubes
| Â½ small onion, finely chopped
| Garlic to taste, finely chopped
| 25g coriander leaves, chopped
| 3 green chillies, finely chopped
| 30ml avocado oil
| 3 medium, or 2 large hass avocados
| Lime or lemon juice
| Salt, to taste
===Method===


| Mix the tomatoes, onion, garlic, coriander and the chillies in a bowl.
| Cut the avocados in half, remove the stone and using a spoon, extract all of the flesh.
| With a fork, coarsely mash the flesh and mix with the remaining ingredients and the lime or lemon juice.
| Add salt to taste.
