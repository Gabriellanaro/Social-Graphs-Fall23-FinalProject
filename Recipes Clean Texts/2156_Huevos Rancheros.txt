===Description===

'''Huevos Rancheros''' (Spanish for \"eggs ranch-style\") is a traditional Mexican country breakfast. From its home in Mexico, the dish has spread throughout the Americas.

===Ingredients===
| 3 tablespoons (45ml) vegetable oil
| 1 medium onion, peeled and finely chopped
| 1 clove Garlic, peeled and crushed
| A pinch chili powder
| 4 plum tomatoes, peeled, seeded and chopped
| 2 corn tortillas
| 2 free range eggs
| Chopped chilli peppers, to taste
| sea salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
| 1 tablespoon freshly chopped coriander or parsley
===Method===


| To prepare the ranchero sauce, in a frying pan, heat 1 tablespoon oil over medium heat
| Add the onion and garlic, and saut\u00e9 until softened, 4 or 5 minutes
| Add the tomatoes, peppers, chili powder, salt and a few grinds of black pepper and reduce to a simmer
| Simmer for about 10 minutes, until the sauce begins to thicken
| Add the coriander or parsley, turn off the heat and cover the pan to keep the sauce warm
| In another frying pan, lightly fry the tortillas in 1 tablespoon of oil. Remove and drain

| Transfer the eggs to the tortillas, and cover with the ranchero sauce
