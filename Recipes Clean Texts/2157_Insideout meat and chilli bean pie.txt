Still tasted like a 'right-way around' meat pie.

 

 The Judge 
===Description===

Time for another experiment!

The pie is formed inside-out - the meat being the 'pastry' and the spicy beans being the filling.

The ingredients I have chosen to use have no specific geographical origin, I just felt that they would go well together in this.   Use what you have that is similar.

''Based on 'Marc Garcy's savoury pie' from the Mexican cook-book: 'Two Cooks and a Suitcase' - Doug Bell & Rhoda Robertson -  a great book that unfortunately falls apart when you try and read it.''

'''A food processor with a metal blade is helpful when making this recipe'''

'''''pie pastry'''''
===Ingredients===
| 200 ml passata
| 450 g minced sirloin steak - I blitzed the cubed steak in a food processor for a minute to mince it.
| 1 onion, peeled and finely chopped
| 2 Cloves of garlic peeled and crushed
| 1 green sweet pepper, deseeded and finely chopped
| 1/4 of a French stick blitzed to breadcrumbs in a food processor
| 1 beaten egg
| 1 teaspoon smoked paprika
| sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
'''''pie filling'''''
===Ingredients===NB
| 400g can red kidney beans, rinsed well & drained
| 200 ml passata
| 2 cups cooked basmati rice - (from just less than 1 cup of uncooked rice.
| 1 tablespoon curry paste - or whatever you fancy to add a little bite
| 1/2 a teaspoon of Mexican oregano
| 3 tablespoons of olive oil
| Splash of red wine or vinegar
| sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
'''''topping'''''
===Ingredients===NB
| Â¼ French stick blitzed to breadcrumbs in a food processor
| 100g g grated Jarlsberg cheese - nicer and way cheaper than Emmenthal
| Olive oil
| sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
'''''garnish'''''
===Ingredients===NB
| Fresh parsley, chopped finely


===Mise en place===
* Preheat the oven to 180\u00b0 C (350\u00b0 F - gas 4), [fan oven 160\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]

===Method===
'''''the crust'''''

| Turn the French stick into breadcrumbs - don't forget to save some for the topping.
| I use fresh bread, roughly sliced. Add to a food processor with a metal blade and blitz into crumbs.
| Add all of the crust ingredients to a bowl and mix well with your hands.
| Lightly spray or grease a pie dish and line it with the meat - You'll need a big dish - I used a Pyrex casserole dish
'''''the filling'''''
| Add the rinsed beans to a bowl and roughly crush them with the end of a rolling pin
| Add the remaining ingredients and mix well with your hands
| Add the filling to the pie
'''''the topping'''''

| Mix all of the topping ingredients together and sprinkle over the top
| Drizzle with a little olive oil
| Cover with tin-foil and bake for 1 hour
| Remove the tin-foil for the last 15  minutes
| Sprinkle with freshly chopped parsley and serve
===Chef's notes===
This was very tasty dish.  It could have done with more gravy and maybe a thinner meat 'pastry'.  A great starting point for further ideas none-the-less.
