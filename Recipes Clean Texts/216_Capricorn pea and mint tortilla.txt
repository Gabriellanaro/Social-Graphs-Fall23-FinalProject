Too minty for me, I'm afraid.

But I don't even like mint in garden peas.

===Description===

This excellent snack recipe comes courtesy of The Lubborn Creamery

===Ingredients===
| 600g potatoes, diced
| 200g garden peas, fresh or frozen
| 6 free range eggs, beaten
| 2 tablespoons freshly chopped mint
| 1 x 100g Capricorn Somerset Goats cheese, diced
| 1 tablespoon olive oil
| 1 bunch spring onions, sliced
===Method===


| Boil the diced potatoes in salted water for 7-8 mins until tender, adding the peas for the last 2 mins.
| Drain and mix with the eggs, mint, seasoning and Capricorn Somerset Goats cheese.
| Heat the oil in a 20cm base non-stick frying pan. Add the spring onions and saut\u00e9 for 2 mins.
| Pour in the egg mixture, mixing it into the spring onions. Cook over a low heat for 20-25 mins, until the egg is almost set.
| Meanwhile, preheat the grill to a medium setting. Place the pan under grill (protecting the handle if it\u0092s not heatproof) and cook for 3-4 mins until set and golden on top.
===Serving suggestions===
Serve warm rather than hot, cut into wedges, with a mixed leaf salad.
