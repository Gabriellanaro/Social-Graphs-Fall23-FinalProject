===Description===

A nice rich vegetarian starter to impress your friends with.

Many thanks to those nice people at The Lubborn Creamery who gave us permission to reproduce this very well written recipe.

===Ingredients===
| 275ml milk
| 1 bay leaf
| 1 shallot, peeled and quartered
| A few gratings of nutmeg
| 50g butter
| 50g plain flour
| 2 x 100g Capricorn Somerset Goats cheese, diced
| 3 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves
| 3 free range eggs, separated
| 1 x 142ml carton double cream


===Mise en place===
* Preheat the oven to 180C (350F, gas 4).
===Method===


| Generously butter 6 x 150ml ramekins and place in a roasting tin.
| Place the milk in a saucepan with the bay leaf, shallot, nutmeg and seasoning. Bring to the boil then strain the flavoured milk into a jug.
| In a clean pan, melt the butter then add the flour and cook for 2 mins, stirring, to cook out the rawness of the flour.
| Remove from the heat and gradually blend in the flavoured milk to make a thick sauce. Simmer over a low heat for 2-3 mins then turn off the heat.
| Stir in three-quarters of the Capricorn Somerset Goats cheese, until it begins to melt, followed by 2 teaspoons thyme and plenty of seasoning, then transfer to a large mixing bowl.
| Add the egg yolks, one at a time, stirring until the sauce is smooth.
| Put the kettle on to boil, then whisk the egg whites to the soft peak stage.
| Mix a spoonful of egg whites into the sauce base to slacken the mixture then carefully fold in the remainder.
| Divide between the buttered ramekins, then pour 1cm depth of boiling water into the roasting tin around the ramekins.
| Bake the souffl\u00e9s for 20 mins until risen and golden.
| Remove the ramekins from their hot water bath using a fish slice, and leave to cool on a wire rack. Run a small knife or spatula around the edge and turn the souffl\u00e9s out.
| When ready to bake, place them on a buttered baking tray, puffy side up.
| Bake for 15 mins in an oven preheated to 180C (350F, gas 4) then pour the cream over the top.
| Scatter the reserved Capricorn Somerset Goats cheese and thyme over the souffl\u00e9s and cook for a further 3-4 mins.
===Serving suggestions===
Transfer to warmed plates and serve immediately with a balsamic-dressed rocket salad.
