And I love pork shoulder in them even more!  I now own about 35 different Taste Sensation spices!

===Description===

Using the last slice of pork shoulder for this experiment with Taste Sensations seasoning mixes.  This one, taco seasoning has the authentic herby, spicy, almost smokey smell.  Fantastic authentic flavour!

===Ingredients===

| 1500g pork shoulder, rind and excess fat removed
| Half a large orange, roughly sliced
| 1 large white onion, finely chopped
| 300 ml white wine
| 2 tablespoons Taste Sensation taco seasoning

===Method===


| Place the pork shoulder in the slow cooker and pour over the white wine
| If you have the time, leave this for a few hours to soak into the meat
| Cover with chopped onions and orange slices
| Slow cook for 8 hours on low, ensuring the cooker does not dry out. Add a little extra wine or water if needed
| Remove as much of the orange rind as you want, drain excess liquid and use to fill taco shells together with onions and salad.
| Sour cream always adds a nice finish!
