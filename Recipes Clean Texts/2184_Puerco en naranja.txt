Another Mexican slow roast pork recipe that is quite similar to Cochinita pibil
[[Image:Puerco en naranja marinading.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Puerco en naranja, marinading]]

===Ingredients===
| 1.5 kg pork shoulder
| 6 fat garlic cloves, peeled and crushed
| sea salt to taste
| 2 teaspoons Mexican oregano
| 12 peppercorns, crushed
| 3 large oranges
| 1 tablespoon Brown sugar or to taste


===Mise en place===
* Remove and discard rind and large amounts of excess fat
* Stab the meat all over with a small sharp knife or cut a shallow cross-hatch pattern in the flesh
* Make a paste with the juice of 1 orange together with the garlic, peppercorns, oregano and salt, reserving the orange skin
* Rub this mixture all over the pork and leave to marinade overnight in a cool place
* Preheat the oven to 180\u00b0 C (350\u00b0 F - gas 4)
===Method===


| Place the pork into a casserole or Dutch oven
| Squeeze the juice of the second orange over the meat and cover with the skins of the two oranges and a layer of tin-foil. cover with a lid and roast for 2 hours
| Drain all of the juices and reserve, discard the orange skins.
| Turn the meat over, add back 3 tablespoons of the juices and roast uncovered for 30 minutes, basting now and then. Add more of the reserved juices if it's drying out.
| Now drain all of the juices and reserve.
| Roast for a further 30 minutes, turning once.
| Remove the joint from the roasting tray, cover and rest while you complete the sauce.
| Skim the reserved juices of any fat.
| Add all of the juices and the brown sugar to the roasting tray
| Heat and reduce, stirring all the time.
===Serving suggestions===
Slice the meat, pour the sauce over the meat and serve at room temperature.  Fried onions, potatoes and a good chili sauce go well with this.
===Variations===
Add a few teaspoons of recado de achiote powder for colour and extra flavour.
===Chef's note===
If you are using a smaller joint, I would still use the same quantity of marinade ingredients.
===Left overs===
Refrigerate any leftovers in a Lock & Lock box . The meat makes wonderful sandwiches!
