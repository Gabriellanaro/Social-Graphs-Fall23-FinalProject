===Description===


This delicious and impressive looking starter or light snack is also suitable for vegetarians.

Many thanks to those nice people at The Lubborn Creamery who gave us permission to reproduce this recipe.

===Ingredients===
| 2 x 100g Capricorn Somerset Goats cheese, cut in half horizontally
| 8 teaspoons cranberry sauce
| 50g walnuts, roughly chopped
| 2 large sheets ready-made filo pastry
| 25g butter, melted


===Mise en place===
* Preheat the oven to 200\u00baC / 400\u00baF / gas mark 6.
===Method===


| Spread out the pastry, brush with melted butter (this will help stop the pastry drying out) and cut into 15 cm / 6 in squares.
| Layer one square on top of another to form a star shape and spread 2 teaspoons cranberry sauce in the centre of each square.
| Place a half Capricorn Somerset Goats cheese on top of the cranberry sauce and sprinkle with the chopped walnuts.
| Draw up the pastry corners and pinch to create an open 'basket', lightly brushing the exposed pastry with melted butter.
| Place on a baking sheet and bake for 5 minutes.
| Allow to cool a little and serve with a mixed leaf salad.
