===Description===

This is a fabulous way to cook fillet steak sous-vide.  The mushrooms keep the meat moist and the cheese add a lovely subtle flavour.

I've added a little extra flavours with the Taste Sensation tex-mex seasoning.

Unfortunately this looked so good when we served it that I forgot to take a picture!
===Ingredients===

| 200g best fillet steak
| 2 large portobello mushrooms, thickly sliced
| 50g Cambozola cheese cut into two slices
| 1 tablespoon Taste Sensation tex-mex seasoning
| Good pinch of freshly ground black pepper

===Method===


| Wrap the steak in cling-film and bash the steak flat using a rolling pin.
| I've found that the shrink wrapped steaks can be bashed in their packaging.
| Roll the flattened steak in the black pepper and Tex-Mex seasoning
| Place the seasoned steak in the vacuum bag with the sliced mushrooms and and place the two slices of cheese on top
| Vacuum seal and cook for 4 hours at 65\u00b0 C
| This time and temperature gives a medium well cooked steak that if as juicy as a raw steak. Lovely!

===Serving suggestions===
One smallish fillet steak cooked in this manner was perfectly sufficient for two people especially iuf served with lots of vegetables.

Serve with potatoes and vegetables of your choosing
===Chef's notes===
Although the quantity of the Tex-Mex seasoning seems a lot, it makes for a nicely seasoned steak, not hot at all.
