I really don't like sweet potatoes, however they are cooked.  You might love this though?

===Description===

A hot and spicy vegetarian side dish from Wahaca's recipes.

===Ingredients===

| 500g sweet potato
| 5 tablespoons Wahaca habanero chilli sauce
| 2 tablespoons olive oil
| Pinch of sea salt
| Pinch of freshly ground black pepper
| Pinch of dried thyme
| 2 red onions
| 100g feta cheese
===Mise en place===

* Preheat a baking tray in your oven at 200\u00b0 C (400\u00b0 F - gas 6), [fan oven 180\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]

===Method===


| Peel the sweet potatoes and chop into bite-sized cubes
| Add the olive oil, Wahaca habanero sauce, salt, pepper and thyme to a Lock and Lock box.  Replace the lid and shake like mad to coat the sweet potatoes evenly
| Peel and quarter the red onions and add the the Lock and Lock box.  Shake more gently this time so as not to separate the onions too much
| Shake the mixture on to the hot baking tray and bake for 40 minutes
| After 35 minutes, crumble the feta cheese over the sweet potatoes and return to the oven for the final 5 minutes
| Serve hot!
===Variations===
*Try this recipe with a variety of chilli sauces!
*Add a tomato salsa to make a tasty vegetarian taco filling.
*Swap the sweet potato for butternut squash.  The cooking times will be similar.
