It's even niceer with a teaspoon of English mustard added as well

===Description===

Both parts of this recipe appealed to me - cheesy mashed potato and herb flavoured [https://www.cookipedia.co.uk/cgi-bin/cc.pl?cftk=2#jump chicken breasts].

Many thanks to those nice people at The Lubborn Creamery who gave us permission to reproduce this recipe.

===Ingredients===
| 6 tablespoons freshly chopped mixed herbs (e.g. chives, parsley, tarragon)
| 4 skinless chicken breasts
| 2 tablespoons olive oil
| 4 stalks cherry tomatoes on the vine
| ½ teaspoon caster sugar
| 1kg floury potatoes, peeled and cut into large chunks
| 200ml milk
| 2 x 100g Capricorn Somerset Goats' cheese, roughly chopped


===Mise en place===
* Preheat the oven to 200\u00b0 C (400\u00b0 F - gas 6), [fan oven 180\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]
===Method===


| Spread the herbs out on a plate, then drizzle 1 tablespoon oil over the chicken breasts and season lightly. Roll in the herbs to coat completely then place on a baking tray.
| Add the tomatoes on the vine, drizzle the remaining oil over the tomatoes and sprinkle with the caster sugar.
| Roast the chicken and tomatoes for 15-20 mins or until the juices of the chicken run clear when pierced. Rest the chicken for 5 mins before slicing.
| Meanwhile, boil the potatoes in a large pan of lightly salted water until tender. Drain into a colander.
| Place the pan back on the heat and add the milk and Capricorn Somerset Goats' cheese, stirring until most of the cheese has melted.
| Mash the potatoes into the molten cheese, adding seasoning to taste.
===Serving suggestions===
Serve the mash with the sliced chicken breasts and roasted tomatoes.
