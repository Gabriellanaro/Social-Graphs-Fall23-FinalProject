===Description===

Wahaca serve two versions of frijoles negros (''black beans'') at their restaurants.  When a blogger asked Thomasina ''\"Tommi\"'' Miers if she could have the recipe, this is what Tommi kindly published.

The base recipe is the same, the toppings are the variation: crumbled chorizo or Lancashire cheese and sour cream.

===Ingredients===

| 400g cooked black beans
| \u00bd red chilli
| 2 stems of coriander
| 50g butter
| 1 small white onion, finely chopped
| 2 cloves of garlic, finely chopped

===Method===


| Cook the onion in the butter until soft then add the garlic and cook for a further minute. 
| Drain the beans reserving the cooking liquid.
| Add the cooked beans with a little of their cooking liquid and whiz in the food processor.
| Remove to a bowl and season to taste.
| Allow to cool and serve with finely chopped shallots, a garnish of coriander and a crumbling of chorizo. 
===Serving suggestions===
Crumbled chorizo ''or'' grated Lancashire and sour cream, a bowl of tortilla crisps and a cold beer!
