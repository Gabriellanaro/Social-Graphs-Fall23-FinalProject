===Description===

Bah\u0101r\u0101t is a spice mixture or blend used throughout the Levant, in Lebanese, Syrian, Jordanian, Iraqi, Libyan and Palestinian cuisine.

Baharat, in Arabic, means \"spices\". The name originated in Medieval India, as Bh\u0101rat, a Sanskrit name for India, was the source of these spices.

Unless you are going to use tons of the stuff, assume half or even a quarter of a teaspoon for one part

===Ingredients===
| 4 parts black pepper
| 3 parts coriander seeds
| 3 parts cinnamon
| 3 parts cloves
| 4 parts cumin seeds
| 1 part cardamom pods
| 3 parts nutmeg
| 6 parts paprika
===Method===


|Grind all of the ingredients to a fine powder in a spice mill or coffee grinder.
|Dried and pulverised kaffir lime leaves can also be added to taste.
|The mixture can be mixed with olive oil and lime juice to form a marinade.
