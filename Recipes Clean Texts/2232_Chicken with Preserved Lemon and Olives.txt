===Ingredients===
| 2 medium red onions, quartered 
| 6 garlic cloves, unpeeled 
| 1 small preserved lemon, halved, pulp removed and discarded, rind thinly sliced 
| 250 ml white wine 
| 8 chicken pieces, a mixture of thighs and breasts, on the bone if possible 
| 3 tablespoons Belazu olive oil 
| Maldon sea salt and freshly ground black pepper 
| 100g pitted green olives, drained 
| A small bunch of flat-leaf parsley, roughly chopped 
'''To serve'''
* 240 g Belazu Barley Couscous, follow the pack cooking instructions

===Mise en place===
* Preheat the oven to 220\u00b0 C (425\u00b0 F - gas 7)
===Method===


| Place the onions, garlic, preserved lemon and wine into a large casserole or ovenproof dish
| Rub the chicken thighs and breasts with the olive oil and sit on top of the vegetables and wine
| Season with the salt and pepper, cover and cook for 1 hour 10 minutes adding the chopped olives after 1 hour
| Remove the chicken pieces to a clean oven tray and return to the oven for 10 minutes just to crisp the skin
