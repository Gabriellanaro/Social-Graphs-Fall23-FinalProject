===Description===

A spicy chicken recipe that is served with a carrot and avocado salad, houmous and pitta bread.
'''for the chicken'''
===Ingredients===
| 2 organic chicken legs 
| 2.5 tablespoons of Belazu Rose Harissa (about half a pot)
| 2 tablespoons clear honey 
| 2 onions, sliced 
| Belazu extra virgin olive oil 
'''for the salad'''
===Ingredients===NB
| 1 organic avocado, sliced 
| 2 organic carrots, peeled and grated 
| a handful of roasted almonds 
| 1 tablespoon Belazu balsamic vinegar 
| 2 tablespoons Belazu extra virgin olive oil 
| 1 tablespoon wholegrain mustard 
'''to serve'''
===Ingredients===NB
| 125 g Houmous 
| 4 Pita breads


===Mise en place===
* Preheat the oven to 200\u00b0 C (400\u00b0 F - gas 6)
===Method===


| Mix the Rose Harissa paste with the honey.
| Peel the skin from the chicken and cut lots of deep slashes in the flesh. Generously cover both sides with the Harissa and honey mix.
| Use my Lock and Lock box trick to make life easier (''see pics'').
| Leave to marinade for a few hours if you have the time.
| Place in a baking dish on a bed of sliced onions, seasoned with salt, pepper and olive oil.
| Cook on middle shelf for 25-35 minutes.
| While the chicken is cooking, mix the olive oil, balsamic vinegar and mustard in a bowl.
| Combine the carrots and the avocado, and stir in the dressing. Finish with some almonds.
| Take the chicken out of the oven and serve with the salad, warm flatbread and a generous dollop of houmous.

===Chef's notes===
I have not yet tried the Belazu rose harissa paste yet, but it cannot be a strong as my harissa paste recipe.  Half a pot of that would put you in hospital for a month!
