[[Image:Mint carrot and onion salad ingredients.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The ingredients for Mint carrot and onion salad]]
A very simple and very tasty salad, we've think this goes very well with home-made pizza.

The basic dressing I usually use is just orange juice, homey and a splash of olive oil.  This time I've used half a teaspoon of dark soy sauce, it adds a salty, rich flavours.  Play around with your favourite flavourings.

The quantities should serve four, but the tow of us can normally manage to eat it all!
===Ingredients===

| 1 medium white onion, peeled and very finely chopped
| 3 small to medium carrots, peeled and finely grated
| Three mint leaves, deveined and finely chopped
| A small bunch of parsley, chopped
| 1 scant teaspoon of honey
| 2 teaspoons of olive oil
| 2 teaspoons of lemon juice
| Â½ teaspoon of dark soy sauce

===Method===


| Mix the carrots, onions and herbs together
| Whisk the remaining ingredients together into a dressing - if the honey is quite set then microwave for 10 seconds to soften
| Mix the dressing in with the salad and chill in the fridge if you have the time.
