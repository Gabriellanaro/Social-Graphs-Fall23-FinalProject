Fattoush, pronounced \"fadash\", is a Levantine salad made from several garden vegetables and toasted or fried pieces of pita bread. Fattoush salad allows cooks to use seasonal produce by mixing different vegetables and herbs according to taste, and also to make use of pitas that have gone stale. The vegetables are cut into relatively larges pieces compared to Tabbouleh which requires ingredients to be finely chopped. Sumac is usually used to give Fattoush its sour taste.

===Ingredients===
| 1 cucumber, peeled, deseeded and diced
| 6 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
| 3 pitta breads, split in two and cut into 2.5 cm (1\") squares
| 2 tablespoons torn fresh coriander leaves
| 2 tablespoons roughly chopped fresh mint
| 2 tablespoons roughly chopped fresh parsley
| 1 red onion, cut into 1cm/½in dice
| 5 ripe tomatoes, peeled, deseeded and cut into 1cm/½in dice
| 2 green bell peppers, deseeded and cut into thin strips
| 2 cloves of garlic, crushed
| 1 tablespoon of sumac or the juice of 1 lemon
| Salt and freshly ground black pepper
===Method===


| Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in a frying pan and fry the pitta bread until it is golden brown. Drain on kitchen paper to remove any excess oil
| Alternatively, cook the pitta bread using our crisp bread recipe, then cut into squares
| Add the garlic, lemon juice, remaining olive oil and the herbs into a bowl and mix well to make the dressing
| Put the diced vegetables in a large bowl and pour the dressing over the vegetables and toss well
| Season to taste with salt and pepper, garnish with the strips of fried bread
