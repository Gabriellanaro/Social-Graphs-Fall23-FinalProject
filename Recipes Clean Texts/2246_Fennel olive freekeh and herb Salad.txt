This is a delicious recipe, sophisticated and hearty at the same time, way more than the sum of its parts. It's absolutely gorgeous on its own but goes well on the side of all sorts of pork and fish dishes
===Ingredients===

| 200g Freekeh 
| 2 fennel bulbs, trimmed and thinly sliced. If there are any fronds at the top, reserve for garnish 
| 2 leeks, washed and thinly sliced 
| 2 courgettes, thinly sliced or spiralised 
| 1 tablespoon coriander seeds, lightly crushed 
| A small handful each of fresh mint leaves, coriander leaves and curly parsley, finely chopped 
| 150g green olives, quartered 
| 100g blanched almonds, toasted and roughly chopped 
| 1 small hot chilli, very finely chopped 
| Juice of half a lemon 
| 1 tablespoon white wine or rice vinegar 
| extra virgin olive oil 
| Salt and pepper
===Mise en place===

* Preheat your oven to 180\u00b0 C (350\u00b0 F - gas 4), [fan oven 160\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]

===Method===


| Turn the oven on to 180C/gas mark 4. Set the freekeh soaking in cold water. 
| Put the fennel, leeks and courgettes on a backing tray in one layer. Season with salt and pepper, give them a good drizzle of olive oil and sprinkle with the crushed coriander seeds. Put them in the oven when it\u0092s up to temperature, setting your timer for 20 minutes 
| When the freekeh has been soaking for 20 minutes, drain and put into a saucepan with 750mls of water. Put on a medium heat and bring gently to a boil. Lower the heat and simmer for about 12 minutes, or just tender and chewy. Drain and set aside 
| When the veggies have been baking for 20 minutes, check them for texture and flavour. They should be cooked, but still have a good bite to them, with the leeks in particular nice and crispy around the edges. As soon as they\u0092re done, sprinkle with a little of the vinegar and set aside. When they\u0092're cool, gently mix the chopped herbs in. Set aside 
| In a bowl, put the olives, almonds, chilli and lemon juice. Stir well, and set aside 
| When you\u0092re ready to serve, combine the freekeh, the veggie mix and the olive mix. Taste, adjust the seasoning with salt, olive oil and lemon juice, if you need to, garnish with the fennel fronds, and serve
