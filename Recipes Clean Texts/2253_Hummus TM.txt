===Description===

This is a translation of a recipe in '''Salsas y Ali\u00f1os con Thermomix (Susaeta Ediciones)'''

===Ingredients===TM
| 250g cooked chickpeas
| 125g natural yogurt
| ½ lemon
| 1 clove garlic
| 2 tablespoons sesame oil
| ½ teaspoon ground cumin
| 2 teaspoons paprika
| Salt
| Pepper
| Chopped parsley
===Method===


| Squeeze the juice from the lemon half and peel the garlic clove.
| Put all of the ingredients, except the parsley and 1 of the teaspoons of paprika, in the bowl.
| Blend at '''Speed 4''' until smooth.  If it is too thick, you can add a little cold water.
| Leave to chill in the fridge for a few hours so that it will achieve the desired consistency and flavour.
| When serving, garnish with the parsley and the remaining teaspoon of paprika.
===Serving suggestions===
This thick sauce or pur\u00e9e is a recipe from the Near East.  There, it is eaten with pitta bread or accompanied by raw vegetables such as carrots, celery sticks or julienned red peppers. 
===Variations===
You can substitute the sesame oil with tahini (sesame paste), which you can get from specialist shops.
