===Description===

A recipe using dried chickpeas rather than tinned or jarred and making a soft textured hummus
===Ingredients===TM
| 200g dried chickpeas
| 1 teaspoon bicarbonate of soda
| 1.2kg tap water
| A further \u00bd teaspoon bicarbonate of soda
| 6 tablespoons tahini
| 6 cloves garlic (or to taste), crushed to a paste
| The juice of 1 large lemon
| 100g water from the chickpeas
| 40-50g extra virgin olive oil
| Coriander leaves, to taste
| Salt
| Extra EVOO
| Smoked paprika, eg Piment\u00f3n de La Vera
===Mise en place===

* Place the chickpeas and bicarbonate of soda in a jug and cover with twice the volume of water.  Leave to soak for 12-24 hours.

===Method===


| Drain the soaking water from the chickpeas, rinse and drain again.
| Place the chickpeas in the internal steaming basket and the tap water and \u00bd teaspoons bicarbonate of soda in the bowl '''50 minutes / 100\u00b0C / Speed 1'''.
| The skins should be loosening and the chickpeas soft - if not, cook for a further 10 minutes.
| Drain (reserving some of the liquid) and leave the chickpeas to cool.
| Remove the skins if a very smooth hummus is desired.
| To the bowl (no need to wash) mix the tahini, garlic and lemon juice with a handful of the chickpeas '''30 seconds / Speeds 5-7-9'''.
| Scrape down the inside of the bowl.
| Add the remaining chickpeas, the chickpea water and the oil '''30 seconds / Speeds 5-7-9'''.
| Add the coriander leaves '''30 seconds / Speeds 6-8-10''' or until you have the desired fineness of coriander.
| Serve in dishes drizzled with the extra oil and sprinkled with the paprika.
===Serving suggestions===
Serve with pieces of vegetables and flat breads suitable cut for dunking
===Variations===
If you want a more textured hummus, reduce the blending times and speeds accordingly.

Tinned or jarred chickpeas can be used (about 275g) but because they haven't been soaked or cooked with bicarbonate of soda, a very smooth result will be more difficult to achieve.
