===Description===

This traditional rice recipe is from Palestine.

===Ingredients===
| 1 kg shoulder or leg of mutton, cut into chunks
| 2 bay leaves
| 2 teaspoons salt
| 2 teaspoons ground black pepper
| 1 teaspoon ground allspice
| ¼ teaspoon nutmeg
| ¼ teaspoon ground cardamom
| A pinch of ground cinnamon
| 1 onion, peeled and left whole
| 600 g round rice - I used arborio as it soaks up juices well.
| Pinch of saffron, pounded
| 4 bulbs Garlic, (or to taste), crushed
| 50 g samneh (clarified butter) or butter
===Method===


| Place the mutton, spices and the whole onion in a pan and cover with water.
| Simmer gently for 1¼ hours or more until the meat is tender.
| Lightly grease a large casserole dish and add the rice to it.
| Strain the mutton into a colander but keep the stock.
| Measure the stock and add enough hot water to bring it up to 1.1 litres.
| Pour over the rice and add the saffron, garlic and samneh or butter.
| Place the cooked meat on the top, cover and cook for 30 minutes at 200\u00b0 C (400\u00b0 F - gas 6), until the rice is cooked and has absorbed the liquid.
===Serving suggestions===
Serve with a plain salad and yogurt or with vegetables.
===Variations===
If liked, you can include some cooked chickpeas, in which case, reduce the amount of rice.
===Chef's notes===
The recipe may seem to require a rather large quantity of rice, but you do need it.

Whilst the mutton will be cooked at 1¼ hours it may still be a little tough, about 2 hours really did make the meat very tender.

You can also reduce the salt down to around 1tsp and it should still be nice, its a personal taste thing.
