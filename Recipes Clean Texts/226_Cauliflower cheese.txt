Made with locally grown caulis, there's nothing like it.

One of my favourite vegetable dishes that goes well with almost anything.  Whilst you could add extra cheese and grill to finish, as a vegetable accompaniment, I don't think it needs that.  If you were having this alone, then maybe

===Ingredients===
| Â½ pint of cheese sauce
| 300 g (11 oz) cauliflower, trimmed and cut to florets.  Most supermarkets sell these ready prepared, lazy and handy!
| Dash of Tabasco sauce (optional)
| Nutmeg (optional)
| Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
===Method===


| Cut an x in the base of any thick stalks so they cook evenly
| Add the cauliflower to a large pan of boiling, lightly salted water and simmer hard for about 10 minutes, depending how you prefer your vegetables cooked
| Meanwhile make the cheese sauce as shown here
| Drain the cauliflower and pour the cheese sauce over the vegetables, mixing well
===Serving suggestions===
Serve hot, sprinkled with grated nutmeg if liked
===Variations===
Top with a little extra cheese and brown under a grill
