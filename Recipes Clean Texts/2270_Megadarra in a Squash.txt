===Description===

Pronounced mega-dah-ra, this simple Egyptian dish of rice, lentils and spiced onions is a super thing to squeeze into a squash.

===Ingredients===

| 4 mini or 1 medium-sized squash
| 75g brown basmati rice
| sea salt and freshly ground pepper
| 1 mug of water
| 400g tin of lentils
| 2 onions, thinly sliced
| 1 tablespoon ground cumin
| A pinch of chilli powder
| A pinch of ground cinnamon
| 1 orange or lemon
| 200g natural yogurt (optional)
===Mise en place===

* Preheat the oven to 200\u00b0 C (400\u00b0 F - gas 6), [fan oven 180\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]

===Method===


| Trim the base of your squashes so they sit flat. Cut the top off your squash as if you were making a Hallowe\u0092en pumpkin.
| Scoop out the seeds (save them for later they are lovely roasted with sugar, salt and spice till golden and crisp). Pop the squash on a baking tray. Roast for 30 mins or till completely tender.
| Get a lidded pan hot for your rice. Toast for a mo. Add a pinch of salt and the water. Cover. Lower heat. Simmer for 20 mins.
| Drain your lentils. Rinse. Once the rice is done, drain it over the lentils. Set aside.
| Get a large frying pan hot. Add a gloss of oil. Tumble your onions and a good pinch of salt and pepper in. Sizzle onions over medium heat for about 10 mins, till golden and a little crisp. Swirl in the spices. Scoop a spoonful of onions into a dish and set aside.
| Keep the onions over medium heat. Fold the rice and lentils in. Add a gloss of oil. Sizzle for a mo, to give the rice a little crispy edge to it.
| Grate in the zest of the orange or lemon. Add a good squeeze of juice. Taste. Season (and add more spices) as needed.
| Once you're happy with the rice, stuff it into the cooked and hollowed out squashes. Scatter the reserved onion over the top.
===Serving suggestions===
Serve with a pot of yogurt, dusted with a little chilli powder.
