(as Welsh Rarebit Day!)

 Paul R Smith 
===Description===

Today, the 24th January 2011, is National Welsh Rarebit Day, so here is a recipe.  Tomorrow I shall be making this for my daughter's breakfast - yes, I know, a day late, but when I thought about it yesterday afternoon, there were no shops open for me to buy the beer!

===Ingredients===
| 225g strong Welsh cheese, such as Black bomber cheese, grated
| 1 tablespoon butter
| 2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce
| 1 teaspoon dry mustard
| 2 teaspoons flour
| A pinch of white pepper
| 60ml beer 
| 4 large slices of bread
===Method===


| In a saucepan, mix the first 6 ingredients.
| Stir in the beer, but do not make it too wet.
| Place the pan on a gentle heat, stirring until the cheese has melted and has become a thickish paste.
| Swivel the mixture around the pan, remove from heat and allow to cool a little.
| Meanwhile, toast the bread on one side only.
| Spread the mixture over the untoasted side and brown under a hot grill.
===Serving suggestions===
Serve either as a breakfast dish, a snack or as a light lunch with a side salad.
===Variations===
Cheddar cheese is often suggested in recipe books as being the best for this dish, so do use it if you are unable to find a suitable hard Welsh cheese.  
Also you can substitute milk for the beer.
===Chef's notes===
Do not use Caerphilly (yummy though it is) as it is too crumbly and in any case most Caerphilly is now made in Somerset!  
Do not use lager - you need bitter really.  If you can find a Welsh one, then so much the better.
