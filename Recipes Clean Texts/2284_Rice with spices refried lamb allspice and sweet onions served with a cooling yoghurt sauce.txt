===Description===

There is no nicer or simpler way to revive lamb leftover from a roast and spare boiled rice* than to put it in a pan with onions that have been cooked until sweet and add the comforting fragrance of allspice and coriander. 

This is an economical dish all the family will love, served with a cooling yogurt, coriander and cucumber sauce.

===Ingredients===
| 4 tablespoons butter, dripping or groundnut oil
| 4 medium white onions, peeled and chopped
| 8 tablespoons leftover roasted lamb, cut into slithers
| 2 teaspoons ground coriander
| ½ teaspoon ground allspice
| Salt and pepper
| 2 tablespoons flaked almonds
'''For the yogurt sauce:'''
* 6 tablespoons whole milk natural yogurt or Greek yogurt
* 4 sprigs coriander, chopped
* ¼ cucumber, halved lengthways, deseeded and then chopped
* 2 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil (optional)

===Method===


| First make the sauce, combining the yogurt with the coriander and cucumber in a bowl.
| Heat the fat in a large frying pan over a medium-low heat and add the onions. 
| Cook slowly for about 10-15 minutes until they are a pale gold colour.
| Add the lamb with the spice and fry for 2 minutes, stirring often. Then add the rice and cook turning it with a spatula to make sure it is well heated. 
| Taste and add salt and pepper if necessary. 
| Transfer to a serving dish.
| In a small pan, toast the almonds until golden then scatter over the rice. 
| Serve the rice with the yogurt on the side.
===Chef's notes===
* Leftover rice is safe to use if it has been stored in the fridge soon after cooking, and is reheated fully.
