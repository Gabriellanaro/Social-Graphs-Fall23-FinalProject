===Description===

Celery soup is one of my favourites so had to cobble together a recipe for making it in a Thermomix.  I feel that the sherry vinegar gives it extra depth without masking the taste of the celery

===Ingredients===
| 1 Spanish onion, quartered
| 1 head celery (with leaves if possible), trimmed and cut into thirds
| 40g olive oil
| 40g butter
| Garlic, to taste, peeled and cloves cut in half
| 1 teaspoon celery seeds
| 1 teaspoon sugar
| Salt (see chef's notes below)
| 2-3 potatoes, peeled and roughly chopped
| 1kg vegetable stock 
| 2-3 tablespoons sherry vinegar
| 250g milk
| Seasoning, to taste

===Method===

| Put the onion, celery and olive oil into the bowl '''5 seconds / Speed 5'''
| Scrape down the side of the bowl '''20 minutes / Temp Varoma / Speed 2 / Reverse Blade / MC Off'''
| Scrape the bowl
| Add the butter, celery seeds, sugar and salt (if using) '''20 minutes / 100\u00b0C / Speed 2 / Reverse Blade / MC Off'''
| Add the potatoes, stock and sherry vinegar '''20-25 minutes / Temp Varoma / Speed 1 / MC''' On
| Add the milk '''1 minute / increasing to Speed 10'''
| Adjust seasoning
| Reheat '''3 minutes / 100\u00b0C / Speed 1'''
| Serve garnished with celery leaves or parsley
===Variations===
The above recipe is for a smooth soup.  Blend for a shorter time at Step 7 if you want to include some texture
===Chef's notes===
You need to think about the type of stock you are using before adding any salt, especially if you use a Thermomix made vegetable stock, you may find that salting is not necessary.
