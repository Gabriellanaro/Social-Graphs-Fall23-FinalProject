===Description===


Since we first made this dip over a week ago, we have made it three times.  It has a nice garlicky bite with warm Middle Eastern spicy warmth.  It's just a matter of tipping the ingredients into a pot of yogurt and stirring. It keeps well too.

===Ingredients===
| 500g yogurt - Greek style is best
| 3 to 4 cloves of Garlic, peeled and crushed 
| 1 level teaspoon ras el hanout
| Pinch of salt
===Method===


| Sprinkle the ingredients into the yogurt and whisk well
| Leave to stand for 30 mins to amalgamate well
| Stir well and serve
===Serving suggestions===
Serve with crispbread, pita bread, spooned onto salads or eaten directly from the bowl!
===Variations===
If you don't have ras el hanout, try garam masala, Pakistani basar or even curry powder
