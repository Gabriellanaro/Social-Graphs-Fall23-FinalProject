===Description===

Kusa Mihshi is courgettes stuffed with rice and minced meat. 
[[Image:Stuffed courgette_ingredients.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Stuffed courgette, the ingredients]]
It is commonly made in Syria, Cyprus, Lebanon, Greece and Turkey. However, the recipe does differ from one country to another.

===Ingredients===

| 1 kg courgettes
| 1 cup short grain rice (soaked in water for half an hour)
| 200 g lamb mice
| 3 tablespoons tomato paste
| 4 cloves of garlic
| 1 tsp.  salt
| ½ tsp. black pepper
| ½ tsp. cumin powder  
| ¼ tsp. turmeric
| 1 teaspoon safflower 
| ¼ teaspoon all spice 
| 1 teaspoon dry mint
| 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
===Method===



| Rinse the courgettes and cut off the tops.
| Core the courgettes with a courgettes corer. 
| In a large bowl, mix the minced meat, rice, vegetable oil, salt and the spices until well combined. 
| To a large pot add tomato puree, water, and salt and bring to a simmer.
|  Lightly work the rice stuffing into the courgettes. Ensure that each courgette is only ¾ full. This is too so that the rice need room to expand once cooked.
|  To the tomato sauce, add of the garlic, salt, and dried mint and stir. Slowly drop the courgettes into the tomato sauce and cover.
|  Cook for about 35-45 minutes on medium heat.
| Test the courgettes by tasting one and see if the rice is cooked and the courgette is soft.
|  Once cooked, take the courgettes out of the tomato sauce as they may break open if left too long in the sauce.
===Variations===
In the same way, you can stuff aubergine and peppers.
===Chef's notes===
This is the way stuffed courgettes is done in Damascus, it might differ from one city to another in Syria.
