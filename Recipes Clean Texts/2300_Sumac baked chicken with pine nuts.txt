There are sumac trees all around us, and I never knew that's where the spice came from.

===Description===

This recipe was inspired by one of the marvellous 'Moro' cookbooks from Sam and Sam Clarke.  Sumac, a sharp, lemony powder, ground from red berries give this dish its distinctive fresh taste.  Serve with simple tomato salad, a creamy-garlic hummus, homemade pitta breads and you will be in Casablanca - possibly.

===Ingredients===
| 4 tablespoons olive oil.
| sea salt and freshly ground black pepper.
| 1 medium whole chicken, jointed, as shown here, skin on.
| 12 spring onions, roughly chopped.
| 2 tablespoons sumac powder.
| A pinch of oregano.
| 2 tablespoons sherry vinegar or red wine vinegar.
| Small pinch of cumin seeds, bruised in a mortar and pestle.
| 50 g pine nuts.
| 3 tablespoons water.

===Mise en place===
* Preheat the oven to 220\u00b0 C (425\u00b0 F - gas 7)
===Method===


| Heat 3 tablespoons of the oil a small oven proof casserole dish or Dutch oven.
| Season the chicken pieces with salt and pepper and brown them, skin-side first, a few at a time and reserve.  Discard the oil.
| Lay the onions in the base of the pan and sprinkle with half of the sumac, the remaining tablespoons of oil, salt, pepper, 1 tablespoon of the sherry vinegar and the cumin seeds and a pinch of oregano.
| Place the chicken pieces on top, skin-side up.  Sprinkle with the pine nuts and the remaining sumac.
| Heat the pan for a 3 or 4 minutes on the hob just to get it sizzling then place in the oven and bake for 35 minutes.
| Place the chicken pieces on a preheated serving dish, deglaze the pan with the remaining tablespoons of sherry vinegar, add the water and mix well to produce a sauce.
| Pour over the chicken and serve immediately.
===Serving suggestions===
Serve with hummus, homemade pitta bread and a simple tomato salad.
===Variations===
I added a whole onion, roughly chopped, with the spring onions.
