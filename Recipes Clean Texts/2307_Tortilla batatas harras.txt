===Description===

I like Tortilla espa\u00f1ola and I like Batatas harras (Lebanese spiced potatoes), so decided to combine the two.  This is a Spanish omelette with chillies, garlic and coriander.

===Ingredients===
| 130 ml olive oil
| 1 kg potatoes, preferably ones which are not floury, eg Cara, Nadine, peeled and sliced
| 2 medium onions, peeled and sliced
| 2 bulbs garlic, peeled and finely diced
| 4 chillies, finely chopped
| 70 g coriander leaves, finely chopped 
| 8 large eggs
| Salt and black pepper to taste
===Method===


| Heat the oil in a medium sized, deepish frying pan at a medium temperarure.
| When hot, add the potatoes, onions, garlic and chillies.
| Cover and reduce the heat, stirring from time to time until the potatoes are cooked and slightly browned (about 20 minutes).
| Meanwhile, beat the egg and seasonings thoroughly in a bowl.
| Drain off most of the excess oil and add the potato mixture to the eggs and stir in the coriander leaves.
| Pour the whole lot back into the pan - there should be enough oil left to coat the bottom of the pan.
| Increase the heat to medium again and cook the omelette until the bottom and sides have set.
| Turn out the omelette onto a plate and slide it back into the pan upside down, so that the other side can be cooked. Alternatively, you can simply leave the omlette in the pan and place it under the grill until the top has set.
| Once cooked, turn it out onto a plate and leave to cool. It is best served at room temperature.
===Serving suggestions===
Serve with salad or in a baguette.
===Variations===
Use as much or as little as you like of the garlic, chillies and coriander.  Add other spices if you wish.
