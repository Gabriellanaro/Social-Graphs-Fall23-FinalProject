===Description===

I was re-arranging my cookery books last week and came across my old wine-making books from almost 30 years ago.  As we have a home-brewing shop in our nearest town I brought some new kit and today have started to make an apple wine.

This is called Cheat's apple wine because I have used apple juice, rather than starting from scratch with apples.  This type of wine is ready to drink fairly soon after making so is ideal for someone who is impatient.

See Chef's notes below for yeast and nutrient quantities.
===Servings===
About 30 bottles

===Ingredients===
| 5 litres apple juice
| 6.5kg sugar
| General purpose wine yeast
| Yeast nutrient
| Water, to make up to 23 litres

===Mise en place===
* Sterlise all equipment
===Method===

| Place all of the ingredients in a large fermenting bin with space for an airlock in the lid.
| Stir and take a hydrometer reading if desired.
| Cover with the lid and plug the airlock space with some cotton wool. 
| Agitate every day, using a sterlised plastic paddle and keep for a week at about 21 degrees celsius.
| Replace the cotton wool with and airlock which has been half-filled with water and keep at about 18 degrees until the desired dryness has been achieved.
| Rack into demijohns, leave for 2 months and rack again.
| The wine should now be ready to drink and can be bottled.
===Variations===
30 bottles is a large quantity and you may prefer to use a 4.5 litre demijohn, which will yield about 6 bottles.
===Chef's notes===
Yeast and nutrients vary.  I used 4 tsps yeast and 5 tsps of nutrient, but you should follow the instructions given on you chosen packet or tub of nutrient and yeast.
