===Description===

This version of za'atar does not contain sumac.  We do have another version that does.

===Ingredients===
| 2 teaspoons basil
| 2 tablespoons  fresh ground thyme
| 1 teaspoon dried thyme
| 2 teaspoons dried oregano
| 2 teaspoons savory
| 2 teaspoons  dried ground marjoram
| 8 tablespoons toasted sesame seeds
| 1 ½ teaspoons sea salt
| Zest of a lemon, very finely chopped
| Zest of a lime, very finely chopped
===Method===


| Roughly grind the sesame seeds in a mortar and pestle or a coffee grinder, set aside
| Make a finer grind of the remaining ingredients
| Mix the two together
| Store in an airtight container, out of the light, for up to 2 months. It begins to lose its flavour if it's stored any longer.
===Serving suggestions===

It can be used as a seasoning for meats and vegetables. 

Mixed with olive oil it makes a spread called za'atar-wu-zayt as a dip for the sesame bread rings known as ka'ak.

You can spread it on a dough base and bake it as bread, in which case it is called manaeesh bi za'atar. 

It is often eaten as a breakfast snack, sprinkled on labneh (yogurt that has been drained until it becomes a tangy, creamy cheese).

Za'atar is often sprinkled on hummus or served with olive oil as a spread or dip.
