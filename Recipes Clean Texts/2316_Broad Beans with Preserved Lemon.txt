I make mine with my own preserved lemons, the Belazu lemons are very expensive!

Baby broad beans are the best to use with this recipe.

===Ingredients===
| 1 teaspoon cumin seeds 
| 500g (11lb 2 oz) small broad beans, podded and shelled or frozen, defrosted 
| 1 large onion, thinly sliced 
| 1 tablespoon smoked paprika 
| 4 tablespoons of Belazu extra virgin olive oil 
| 1 medium bunch of coriander, roughly chopped 
| Â½ Belazu preserved lemon thinly sliced 
| juice of 1 lemon
===Method===


| Dry fry the cumin seeds in a small frying pan for 30 seconds until you smell the aroma. Remove from the pan immediately. Grind into a powder using a pestle and mortar or the end of a rolling pin in a bowl.
| Put the beans in a large pan and add the ground cumin, onion, paprika, olive oil and 6 tablespoons of cold water. Season, cover and bring to the boil.
| Turn down the heat and simmer, covered, for 10-15 mins until the beans are tender. (Less for defrosted frozen beans). If necessary, top up the water.
| Add the coriander, preserved lemon and lemon juice, then adjust the seasoning.
===Serving suggestions===
Serve hot or warm with couscous and griddled lamb or river trout.
===Variations===
Try this with other beans or even peas. French beans would be nice though you would probably want to reduce the cooking time a little.
