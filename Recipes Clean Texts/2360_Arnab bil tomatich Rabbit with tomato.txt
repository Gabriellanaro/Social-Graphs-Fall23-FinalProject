===Description===


This rabbit recipe is from Algeria.

===Ingredients===
| 2 tablespoons olive oil
| 2 tablespoons smen (clarified butter) or 25 g butter
| 1 onion, finely chopped
| Garlic to taste, finely chopped
| 1 kg boneless rabbit meat, cut into small chunks
| 1 teaspoon salt
| ½ teaspoon ground black pepper
| 1 teaspoon or more of harissa
| 2 bay leaves
| ½ teaspoon ground cumin
| 600 ml water or chicken stock
| 450 g ripe tomatoes, peeled and chopped
| 1 tablespoon tomato pur\u00e9e diluted in 150 ml water
===Method===


| Heat the oil and the smen or butter in a large pan, add the onion and garlic and saut\u00e9 until the onion is soft.
| Add the rabbit pieces, stir, cover and fry for 15-20 minutes, stirring often to ensure that the meat is sealed on all sides.
| Stir in the salt, pepper, harissa, bay leaves, cumin and water or stock and bring to the boil.
| Reduce the heat, cover and simmer for 40 minutes.
| Stir in the tomatoes and tomato pur\u00e9e into the pan and simmer for a further 20-30 minutes until the sauce has thickened and the rabbit is tender.
===Serving suggestions===
Serve with steamed rice or pasta.
===Variations===
Instead of rabbit, you could use chicken or turkey, both of which are consumed in Algeria.  Alternatively, you could try pheasant or partridge.
