A fiery spice mixture originating from the Arabian/African areas around Eritrea, Ethiopia and Somalia.

It is used as a rub for meats, seasoning for meat and lentil stews or just as a condiment.  As with all spice mixes, this is just one variant of many.

===Ingredients===
| 20 dried bird's eye chillies
| 1 teaspoon coriander seeds
| Seeds from 8 green cardamoms
| 12 allspice berries
| 1 teaspoon ground ginger
| 1 teaspoon white cumin seeds
| 1 teaspoon black cumin seeds
| 1 teaspoon fenugreek seeds
| 8 cloves
| 2\" cinnamon stick, cracked into pieces
| Â½ teaspoon ajowan
| 1 teaspoon black peppercorns
===Method===


| Roughly crush the chillies and dry fry for 3 minutes
| Add the remaining whole spices and dry fry for a further 5 minutes
| Allow to cool
| Grind to a fine powder in a coffee grinder or mortar and pestle
| Store in an airtight container for up to 3 months
===Servings===
Serves 10 - Makes 1 jar
===Chef's notes===
If you cannot obtain ajowan, use caraway seeds or dried thyme instead.

I have seen versions of this recipe that use long pepper, which can be difficult to obtain in Europe. Use normal black pepper instead.
