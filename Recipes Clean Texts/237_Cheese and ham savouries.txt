 The Judge 
===Description===

A nice quick and easy snack which can work well as a main course too.

A whole roll of ready-made puff pastry makes 4 of these and there quite substantial.  I've used pre-sliced Maasdam cheese because I that was what was in the fridge at the time - any of you favourite cheeses would work in this - even blue cheese!

I also added a teaspoon of curry powder to one of mine - Yum ðŸ¤ª!
===Ingredients===

| 1 roll of ready made puff pastry
| 6 slices of Maasdam cheese, rolled and chopped
| 4 medium sized slices of ham, rolled and chopped
| A few tablespoons of milk
===Mise en place===

* Pre-heat your oven to 180\u00b0 C (350\u00b0 F - gas 4), [fan oven 160\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]

===Method===


| Quarter the puff pastry into squares
| Chop the cheese and ham and divide into four piles
| Add the mixture to the middle of the pastry
| If you want to add any extra flavourings, do this now
| Roll up or 'pasty-fy' your savoury
| Use a fork to seal the edge or squeeze the edges together to seal
| Brush with a little milk so the pastry turns golden when cooked
| Pop onto a baking tray lined with grease-proof paper
| Bake for 30 minutes or until they 'look' nice.
