===Description===


This typical Algerian cauliflower dish is cooked in a sauce of tomatoes, garlic, paprika, coriander and harissa.

===Ingredients===
| 1 large cauliflower, broken into florets
| 4 tablespoons olive oil
| Garlic to taste, chopped
| 2 large ripe tomatoes, peeled and chopped
| 1 teaspoon salt
| ½ teaspoon ground black pepper
| 1 teaspoon sweet paprika
| 1 teaspoon or more harissa
| 4 tablespoons long grain rice, washed under cold running water
| 2 teaspoons coriander leaves, finely chopped
===Method===


| Bring a large pan of lightly salted water to the boil, add the caulflower and simmer for 5 minutes.
| Drain the cauliflower.
| Heat the oil in a large pan, add the garlic, tomatoes, salt, pepper, paprika and harissa and fry for a minute or two, stirring constantly.
| Add 300 ml water, bring to the boil and simmer for 10 minutes.
| Add the rice, coriander and caulflower, stir gently and simmer, uncovered, until the rice and caulflower are cooked, stirring occasionally.
===Chef's notes===
I see no reason why you cannot use frozen cauliflower if necessary, in which case, omit step one of the instructions.
