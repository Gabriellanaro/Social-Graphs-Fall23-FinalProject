This recipe is kindly taken from Nik & Edwina's cookbook, a marvellous on line cookery resource.

===Ingredients===
| Half a small onion, finely diced
| 2 tablespoons finely chopped mint leaves
| 2 Cloves garlic finely chopped (optional)
| 1 large egg
| 125ml ice cold water
| 75g plain flour
| 2 teaspoons ground turmeric
| 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
| 2 teaspoons freshly ground cumin seeds
| 1 teaspoon salt
| Half a medium sized cauliflower, broken into small florets
| Light oil such as peanut or sunflower oil for frying
===Method===


| Lightly whisk the egg in a small bowl, then add the ice cold water. Keep in the fridge until ready to use
| Mix the onion, garlic and mint together in another bowl
| In a third bowl sift together the flour, turmeric, cinnamon, cumin and salt
| Bring a pan of salted water to the boil. Cook the cauliflower in boiling water for 2-3 minutes or until just tender but with some crispness. Drain, and return to the pan
| Mash the cauliflower and add the contents of all three bowls ie. everything except the cooking oil
| Pour a good slick of oil into a wide heavy based frying pan, and heat. It should be enough to coat the pan to 2-3mm
| Drop tablespoons of the cauliflower mix into the hot oil to make fritters about 6-7 cm in diameter. Cook for a minute or so until browned and turn. Drain on absorbent kitchen towels, and place in low oven to keep warm. Repeat
| Cook in batches until all fritters are made
| Serve immediately. See suggestions above
