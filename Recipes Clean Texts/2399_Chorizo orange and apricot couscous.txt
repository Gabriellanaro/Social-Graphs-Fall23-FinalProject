===Description===

We love couscous and had sort of planned for this dish so had the basics, but as always, the available leftovers decided the final recipe.  Don't follow this recipe exactly, be bold and experiment with the ingredients, you won't be disappointed.

'''Frying the chorizo'''
===Ingredients===
| 150 g (5 oz) dried couscous
| 250 ml chicken stock ( I used some leftover Butternut squash bisque with a little water, heated in the microwave)
| 1 onion, peeled and chopped
| 2 Cloves of garlic, peeled and chopped roughly
| A very good slug of olive oil
| ½ small of pack sliced chorizo sausages and ½ small pack of sliced peppered salami (or any interesting spicy 'cold-meat' combination)
'''Apricot sauce'''
===Ingredients===NB
| 8 dried apricots, chopped
| zest of an orange
| Juice, zest and chopped flesh 1 orange
| 4 tablespoons sherry
| 1 teaspoon cumin seeds, bruised and crushed, not powdered
| 1 teaspoon caraway seeds, bruised and crushed, not powdered
| Pinch of salt
| Ground black pepper
'''Salad ingredients'''
===Ingredients===NB
| 1 small sweet pepper, deseeded and chopped (we had loads of miniature coloured sweet peppers that we used this time)
| 2 fresh tomatoes, chopped
'''Garnish'''
| Handful of shelled pistachio nuts, crushed
| Bunch of fresh parsley leaves, finely chopped
===Method===


| Bring your stock to boiling and pour over the couscous, leave to stand for about 15 minutes or until the stock is absorbed
| Fry the onions and garlic in a good slug of olive oil for about 5 minutes - the more flavoured oil you can get on the couscous, the better
| Roll the meat slices and chop into slivers
| Fry the meat until the fat from the meat colours your oil, remove from the heat
| In a small pan, add the chopped apricots, orange flesh and juice, crushed spices, pinch of salt and a grind of pepper and gently simmer until the sherry has reduced and all you are left with is a nice sticky goo.
| Mix the couscous, salad ingredients and apricot sauce together, sprinkle with pistachio nuts and parsley

===Serving suggestions===

Serve hot, warm or cold

===Chef's note===

As this dish is all about the taste and texture explosions of all the different ingredients, I find it's better to chop the garlic so you have little taste bites, rather than crush it and just add the general flavour.
