I think the roasted peppers made all the difference.

===Description===

The peppers and garlic are roasted.  Preserved roasted red peppers such as Pimientos del Piquillo de Lodosa are excellent for this recipe and a great time saver.  The recipe has no particular country of origin, but its flavours are a combination of Spanish and Maghreb

===Ingredients===
| 2 bulbs garlic, separated into cloves and peeled
| 80 ml olive oil
| 2 large red peppers, roasted and peeled or preserved, and cut into strips
| 380 ml vegetable or chicken stock
| 180 g couscous
| 90 g melted butter
'''For the dressing'''
* 125 ml Gazpacho ligero con mostaza or tomato juice
* 1 tablespoon sherry vinegar
* 1Â½ teaspoons harissa
* 60 ml olive oil
* 4 tablespoons herbs, finely chopped, eg. chives, flat-leaved parsley

===Mise en place===
* Preheat the oven to 180\u00b0 C (350\u00b0 F - gas 4) and roast the garlic in the oil for 25 minutes.
===Method===
