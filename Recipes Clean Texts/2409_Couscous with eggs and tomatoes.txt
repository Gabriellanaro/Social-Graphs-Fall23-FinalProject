This quick to make vegetarian dish has North African influences and would make a great lunchtime snack.

===Ingredients===
| 675 g (1.5 lb) tomatoes
| 1 to 2 hard-boiled eggs per person
| 4 garlic cloves, chopped finely
| 5 tablespoons (75 ml) olive oil
| 1 fresh red chilli, deseeded and sliced into rings
| 2 teaspoons soft brown sugar or grated jaggery
| 1 large onion, peeled and chopped finely
| 50 g (2 oz) sultanas or dried apricots, chopped finely
| 2 celery sticks, sliced into moons
| 1 cup couscous
| 350 ml (12 fl oz) vegetable stock (a veggie stock cube in boiled water would do ok)
| 1/2 a teaspoon of caraway seeds, lightly crushed in a pestle and mortar (optional)
| 1/2 a teaspoon of black cumin seeds, lightly crushed in a pestle and mortar (optional)
| Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
| A handful of almond flakes; toasted, if you so wish


===Mise en place===
* Preheat the oven to  204\u00b0 C (400\u00b0 F - Gas 6)

===Method===


| Slice the tomatoes in two and lay on a baking tray
| Drizzle with 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of the olive oil, sprinkle with chopped chilli, sugar, salt and pepper - roast for 20 minutes
| Drop the eggs into boiling water, return top the boil and boil for 4 minutes - remove and plunge into cold water until cold then peel
| Heat the 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of the oil in a large pan on a low heat and soften the onion and celery until soft, about 5 minutes
| Add the sultana and couscous and stir-fry for a few minutes
| Tip in the stock and couscous into the pan, cooks for a few minutes then leave, covered so all of the liquid is absorbed into the couscous
| Add the tomatoes, spices, if using, and remaining 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of olive oil, season to taste and in a food processor, blend to a paste, add a little hot water if it is too dry
| Arrange the eggs in a large serving bowl or four separate bowls, spoon half of the tomato sauce over the eggs, and cover with couscous, sprinkle with almond flakes
| Serve with the remaining sauce in a bowl or gravy boat
