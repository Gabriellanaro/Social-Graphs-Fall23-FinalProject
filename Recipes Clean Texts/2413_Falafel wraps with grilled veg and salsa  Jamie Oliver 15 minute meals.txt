===Description===

I've been watching Jamie Oliver's 15 minute meals lately and I'm impressed with the ideas that have gone into these recipes.

I'm more interested in the variations of these menus that the fact that they can be made in 15 minutes - though I doubt a mere mortal could complete them in such a short time!

Anyway, this is my variation on Jamie's Falafel wraps with grilled veg & salsa - I've made this in 4 person quantity and we'll have this for 2 days.

| 400g can of mixed pulses or mixed beans

===Method===
'''falafels'''

| Drain the beans and chickpeas and dry them really well.  A salad spinner is a good way to do this.  They need to be really dry or the falafels will not stick together.  
| Tip them into the food processor with all the falafel ingredients and blend to a fairly fine paste
| Using wetted hands, form the falafel mix into about 12 balls and press them flat so there is a good surface to fry and brown
| Fry then is a tablespoon of olive oil, turn them once they have browned , the less you handle them, the less chance these is of them falling apart. Don't worry if they fall apart - mine did!  They are going in a tortilla wrap anyway.
'''grilled vegetables'''

| Add a spay of olive oil to your griddle pan and throw in all of the vegetables for grilling together with the herbs
| Gill for 10 minutes or more, turning now and then
| Add the juice of half a lemon just before you serve
'''salsa'''

| Add the tomatoes, chopped chilli, coriander stems and leaves, crushed garlic, lime juice and zest and seasoning to the food processor and blitz until it  gets to your desired consistency - chill if you have the time
'''cottage cheese'''

| Stir in a tablespoon of chilli sauce to add some colour and bite
'''corn tortillas'''

| Microwave for 45 seconds just to moisten them and warm them a little
===Serving suggestions===
Spread everything out and tuck in!

===Variations===
Try you own variation on herbs and spices

Courgettes and carrots make a nice change for the grilled vegetables.
