Whilst I am making this bread from a sourdough leaven, you can make a version with commercial yeast by using 10g fresh or 5g dried yeast in place of the leaven.  This will need to be started the day before you want to bake it.

===Ingredients===
| 200g sourdough leaven
| 500g strong white bread flour
| 325g sparkling mineral water
| 30g onion powder
| 1 teaspoon finely crushed sea salt or Rose Pink Himalayan rock salt
| 125g Parmesan, grated (See '''Variations''' below)
| 125g Tickler cheese, grated
| 75g (after stones have been removed) black olives, chopped


===Mise en place===
* If your sourdough leaven has been in the fridge, remove it the day before you want to start making your bread and refresh it with 50g flour and 40g water. 
===Method===


| Mix the sourdough leaven with 250g of the flour and all of the water and leave for several hours.
| Add the remaining flour and the onion powder, knead according to your chosen method and shape into a ball.
| Place in an oiled bowl, cover with clingfilm and refrigerate overnight.
| Remove from the fridge and leave at room temperature until it has almost doubled in size.
| Gently deflate, shape into a ball and again, place in an oiled bowl, cover and leave to rise a second time.
| When it has almost doubled in size, mix in the salt, cheeses and the chopped olives.
| Shape and place in a 900g loaf tin and leave to prove until it has risen to the top of the tin.
| Preheat the oven to its highest temperature.
| Slash if desired and bake for 30-40 minutes, reducing the temperature to 220\u00b0 C (425\u00b0 F - gas 7), [fan oven 200\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour].
| After 30 minutes, remove from tin and place upside down on a baking tray.  Return to the oven for a further 10-15 minutes.
| Allow to cool on a wire rack.
===Serving suggestions===
Great with salad.
===Variations===
Use any combination of hard, strong cheese you like.  As there is no vegetarian Parmesan, use Bookhams not just a pasta cheese which is a vegetarian cheese made in a similar way to Parmesan and is available in branches of Waitrose.  Tickler is a vegetarian Cheddar type cheese available in most supermarkets.
===Chef's notes===
Make sure your tin is oiled well with groundnut oil or line with Bake-O-Glide.
