Quick to prepare and cook, an ideal summer barbecue recipe. You'll need a food processor to make this easily

===Ingredients===
| 2 lamb tenderloin fillets
| 10 cm (4\") Ginger root, peeled and roughly chopped
| 30 g (3 oz) coriander leaves
| 2 teaspoons toasted white cumin seeds
| 1 teaspoon toasted black cumin seeds (optional)
| 2 garlic cloves, peeled
| 2 tablespoons lemon juice
| 2 teaspoons paprika powder
| 1 teaspoon turmeric powder
| 1 teaspoon sea salt
| A good glug of olive oil
===Method===


| Cut the fillets so you have four servings
| Hammer them flat under a large knife - see here
| Place in a bowl
| Lightly crusg the cumin seeds in mortar and pestle or a coffee grinder if you have one
| Put the remaining ingredients including the cumin in the food processor
| Blitz until you have a smooth paste
| If the mixture refuses to amalgamate,add a little more liquid.  I squeeze a tangerine into the mixture to get it going, but only because I had one to hand. A tablespoon or so of water would do
| Pour over the lamb and marinate in the refrigerator for an hour
| Lay the lamb fillets on an oiled barbecue hotplate
| Cook for 8 minutes, turning three times in total, check that it's cooked to your liking
| Rest for 5 minutes
| Slice thickly and serve
===Serving suggestions===

Serve with Chinese coleslaw
