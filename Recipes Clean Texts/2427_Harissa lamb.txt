This spicy treat is equally as good as a kitchen cooked meal or as a barbecue.  If you already have the harissa paste then it really is simple.  Give it a try.

===Ingredients===
|4 lamb loin fillets, sliced into ½\" (1 cm) thick medallions
|1 tablespoon olive oil
|1 tablespoon lemon juice
|1 teaspoon freshly ground coriander 
|1 teaspoon freshly ground cumin 
|2 tablespoons freshly chopped mint leaves
|Handful of coriander leaves and stalks, roughly chopped
|3 teaspoons harissa paste
===Method===


| Meat aside, mix all of the ingredients together to produce a marinade.
| Coat the meat well and marinate for 1 hour
| Because cooking hot chillies, or chili paste can cause breathing difficulties, ensure the kitchen is well ventilated, ideally with an extractor fan
| On a hot oiled griddle pan, cook for barbecue the lamb for a total of 8 minutes, 4 minutes per side.
| Remove, cover and rest for 5 minutes before serving
===Serving suggestions===

Serve with couscous and yogurt with chopped chives.

===Variations===

This dish makes a good barbecue, either as medallions on a griddle plate, or fillets, sliced lengthwise on the grill, though you would probably need to increase the cooking time for whole steaks
