Sounds nasty - you can try it if you want!

This recipe is from my copy of \"Rayess' art of Lebanese cooking\" - George N. Rayess - 1966 (translated), that I picked up at the second-hand book store in the National Trust cafe at Plas Newydd Country House and Gardens.

The book is a great reminder of how food was prepared in the past. A great source of inspiration, though I don't think I'll be making this recipe.

===Ingredients===
| Head of one sheep and eight feet
| 5 Cloves of garlic mashed with salt and dried mint
| 1 tablespoon salt
| 4 oz very sharp vinegar

===Method===

| Put the head and feet in boiling water for one minute
| Take out and scrape with a sharp knife until all hair and fuzz is removed
| Singe head and feet over a low flame turning them all around until all fuzz is burnt
| Cut the head in two pieces
| Strike hard on the nose to bring out what is inside it
| Split the hooves and remove hair sack and clean all over with cold water
| Rub it with salt and wash with soap and finally rub with rose water
| Place in a large pot and cover with cold water to which salt is added
| Boil first over a high heat until scum appears. Skim carefully
| Reduce heat to medium and cook until contents are done
| This requires about four hours
| Make the sauce by mashing the garlic in salt and mint to the vinegar and mix well
| Serve the meat in one dish and the sauce in another
| serve some of the broth in which the head and feet were cooked

Note: ''Instead of rose-water you may rub the head and feet with pieces of onion or with flour and lemon juice''
