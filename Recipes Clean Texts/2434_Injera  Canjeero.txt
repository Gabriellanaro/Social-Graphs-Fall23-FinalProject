Probably more of a subsistence food than a delicacy.

===Description===

'''Injera''' or '''millet bread''' is Ethiopia's famous pancake-style bread that is similar to a cr\u00eape.

It is also known as '''enjera''' or '''taita''' is a pancake-like bread made out of teff flour. It is traditionally eaten in Eritrea, Ethiopia, Somalia (where it is also called '''laxoox''' and '''canjeero'''). Although traditionally made from teff flour it can also be made from millet flour which will probably be easier to obtain outside of Africa. It is traditionally made using huge tavas, producing table-cloth sized injera that are consumed with the meal.

It's probably prudent to reduce the scale here and make them using a large frying pan!

'''Main ingredients'''
===Ingredients===
| 110 g (4 oz) millet flour
| 250 g (2 oz) plain flour
| 1 teaspoon dried active yeast
| Salt
| Oil for frying


===Mise en place===
* Mix all of the main ingredients together with enough lukewarm water to produce a pourable batter.
* Cover with a damp cloth and leave overnight in a warm place to ferment. 
===Method===


| Stir the fermented batter and add salt to taste.
| Heat a very small amount of oil on a tava or in a frying pan.
| Pour a small amount of batter into the pan and swill it around as you would with normal pancakes.  Ideally making a very thin pancake that covers the whole pan.
| Cook until set, which will only take a minute or so.
| If you've made the pancakes very thick, you may have to turn them, otherwise, serve immediately.
