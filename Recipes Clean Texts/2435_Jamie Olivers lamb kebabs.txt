===Description===

I saw this k\u00f6fte-style kebab recipe on the excellent 'Jamie at Home' series and as I already had the sumac, I thought that I would recreate this dish on Cookipedia.

You will need a food processor.

===Ingredients===
| 500 g (1 lb 2 oz) neck of lamb, trimmed of excess fat and sinews
| A handful of freshly chopped thyme leaves
| 1 teaspoon chili powder
| ½ teaspoon freshly ground cumin seeds
| 2 teaspoons of sumac (use rind and juice from ½ a lemon or lime if you don't have sumac)
| A good pinch of sea salt and freshly ground black pepper.
| 1 big handful of shelled pistachio nuts
''' To serve'''
* A large handful of freshly chopped parsley
* 1 red onion, peeled and very thinly sliced
* Juice from 1 lemon
* 150g Thick set Greek yogurt
* Salad leaves
* Flour tortillas
'''TO garnish each kebab
* A pinch of chili powder
* A pinch of sea salt
* A pinch of cumin powder
* A pinch of thyme leaves
* A pinch of sumac
* A splash of olive oil

===Method===


| Trim all of the sinews and most of the fat from the meat and cut into 2.5 cm (1\") cubes
| Add the pistachio nuts to a food processor with a steel cutting blade and blitz to rice-sided pieces
| Add the meat cubes to the food processor.
| Add the chili powder, cumin, sumac (or lemon), thyme and salt and pepper.
| Pulse the food processor until you have a pretty chunky mince. Don't puree it to a meat paste!
| Using about 5 or 6 metal skewers, wrap a good handful of the meat mixture around each skewer.
| Refrigerate for an hour or two if you can as it will allow the meat to settle and the flavours to mingle.
| Cook the kebabs on a very hot grill or barbecue for about 4 to 5 minutes, turning now and again.
| Add the chopped parsley and thinly sliced onion to a bowl and squeeze the juice from ½ a lemon over the onions. Add a good pinch of salt and toss the mixture well.
| Warm the tortillas, don't toast them.
| Season the salad leaves with olive oil, the remaining lemon juice and a pinch of salt.
| Lay a selection of salad leaves on the tortilla, add a dollop of Greek yogurt and a handful of mint and onion.

Add a  pinch of chili powder, sea salt, cumin powder, thyme leaves and a dash of olive oil to each kebab as you make them, roll up and serve. I prefer to make them up as I am eating them, but it's your call.

===Chef's note===
Although Jamie put the pistachios in with the meat, they stayed mainly in one piece (and kept falling off the kebabs), so I would be inclined, next time, to blitz them to small ''rice-sized'' pieces, before adding the meat.
