..but with Taste Sensation powders and potions, anything is possible!

===Description===

This must be one of the most improbable recipes I've thought up, but it's bloody brilliant! The Yorkshires are slightly more 'puddingy' than normal, but perfectly acceptable.  They have a lovely flavour - to easy to eat directly out of the pan \ud83d\ude1c.
===Ingredients===
| 1 large egg
| 1 tablespoon of Olive oil to grease the baking tray
| 75 ml milk (any type)
| 55 ml water
| 75 g plain flour
| Â½ cup of eggs (2 large eggs or 3 small eggs)
| 2 tablespoons of Taste Sensation Well Matured Cheese Powder
| 1 teaspoon of onion powder 
| A pinch of salt
| A pinch of freshly ground black pepper

===Mise en place===
* Preheat the oven to 220\u00b0 C (425\u00b0 F - Gas 7)

===Method===


| Brush the popover tray with the olive oil and preheat the oven
| Place the tray in the middle of the oven until and leave until the oil is hot and almost smoking
| A everything to a bowl and whisk well until all the ingredients are well combined
| Leave the mixture to rest '''at room temperature'' for 30 minutes''' while the oven heats up
| Spoon the batter mixture into the very hot tray
| Bake for 20 minutes in the middle of the oven.
===Chef's notes===
We have only used olive oil for cooking for the last 5 years and found that it's fine for recipes like this - much nicer than cheap vegetable oil.
