Thick and warming, this soup is great comfort food on a winter evening, serve with warm crusty bread.

===Ingredients===
| 1.5 tablespoons of olive oil
| 1 onion, peeled and chopped
| 2 carrots, scrubbed and diced
| 2 cloves of garlic, peeled and crushed
| 225 g (1/2 lb) of dry red lentils
| 6 cups of vegetable stock or water
| 1 bay leaf
| Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
| A squeeze of lemon juice
===Method===


|Pick over the lentils and remove any stones.  Rinse well.
|Heat the olive oil, with a twist of pepper, in a large pan over medium heat.  Once oil is hot, add the onion and carrots.  Saut\u00e9  for a few minutes, until the vegetables have started to soften, then add the garlic, stir-fry until the garlic takes some colour.
|Add the lentils, bay leaf, and stock to the pot.  Simmer over low-medium heat for 25-35 minutes, until lentils are softened.
===Serving suggestion===
