===Description===

'''Mitmita''' (or '''mit'mitma''') is a very spicy powdered seasoning used in the Cuisine of Ethiopia. It is orange-red in colour and can contain ground African birdseye chili peppers, cardamom seeds, cloves, ground cinnamon, ground cumin, ginger powder and salt. It is used to season the raw beef dish kitfo and may also be sprinkled on ful medames and fava beans.
