I love how easy this is to make and gruyere is just my favourite cheese.

===Description===

As omelettes are so quick and easy to make, it's probably better to make an individual omelette for each person rather than make one huge omelette.  Either way, I would not recommend making a single omelette for more that three people as it would not cook properly.

===Ingredients===
| 2 large free-range eggs
| 50 g ( 2 oz) gruyere cheese, grated
| Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
| Splash of cream or milk (optional)
| 1 tablespoon butter or olive oil
===Method===


| Break the eggs into a bowl with the salt, pepper, milk and cheese
| Mix roughly with a knife. Don't whisk - it's nice to get some white and yolk only areas in the omelette
| Add the butter to a small frying pan
| When the butter is foaming add the mixture to the pan
| Fry for 2 minutes on this side, pulling the solid edges to the centre with a fork
| Flip over and fry for 1 minute on the other side
| Slide on to a warm serving plate, folding the omelette - the last bit of cooking is done one the plate this way
===Serving suggestions===
Serve immediately

===Variations===
Experiment with various cheeses, chopped herbs such as chives or parsley.

Rub the pan with half a garlic clove prior to frying (discard the garlic).

Add a handful of microwaved mixed vegetables just before folding over.
