===Description===

Although normally made from lamb, this Algerian soup can also be found made from mutton or veal

===Ingredients===
| 4 tablespoons oil
| 1 onion, finely chopped
| 225 g lamb, mutton or veal, cut into 1 cm cubes
| 1 teaspoon salt
| 1 teaspoon paprika
| ¼ teaspoon cinnamon
| 1 teaspoon harissa
| 1 tablespoon coriander leaves, finely chopped
| 2 tablespoons parsley, finely chopped
| 1 tablespoon mint, finely chopped
| 3 large tomatoes, peeled and chopped
| 1.8 litres water or stock
| 175 g whole lentils
'''For the semolina dumplings'''
* 375 g medium semolina
* ½ onion, finely chopped
* 1 tablespoon coriander leaves, finely chopped
* 1 tablespoon parsley, finely chopped
* 1 tablespoon mint, finely chopped
* 1 teaspoon salt
* ½ teaspoon black pepper
* 1 egg, beaten
* 90 ml oil
* 90 ml water

===Method===


| Heat the oil in a large pan and fry the onion until soft.
| Add the meat and cook until it has browned on all sides.
| Stir in the salt, paprika, cinnamon, harissa, coriander, parsley, mint and tomatoes.
| Cook over a low heat for 10 minutes, stirring regularly.
| Add the water or stock and the lentils and bring to the boil.
| Lower the heat and simmer for 20 minutes.
| Meanwhile, make the semolina dumplings by mixing the semolina, onion, herbs, salt and pepper in a bowl.
| Mix in the egg and the oil and add enough water to make a pliable dough which holds together.
| Dampen your hands and roll the dough into apricot sized balls.
| When the soup has finished simmering add the dumplings to the pan and simmer for a further 30 minutes until the meat and lentils are cooked.
| If the soup is too thick, add a little more water or stock.
| Place the dumplings in bowls and ladle the soup over them.
===Serving suggestions===
This is quite a hearty soup so you may not need anything to accompany it, but bread would be fine.
