This condiment is great dripped on grilled meat and poultry.

As this uses a large quantity of chillies you are probable best sourcing these from an ethnic store rather than a supermarket!

===Ingredients===
| 250 g (8 oz) fresh red birdseye chillies
| 1 small onion, peeled and quartered
| 1 clove of garlic, peeled
| Juice of 1 lemon
| Zest of 1 lemon
| Big pinch of sea salt
===Method===


| Wear rubber gloves!
| Remove the seeds from the chillies if you don't want the sauce too hot
| Blend all the ingredients in a food processor
