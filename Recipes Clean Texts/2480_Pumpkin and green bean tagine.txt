Made this, with and then without argan oil and couldn't tell this difference!  Was good though.

A nice vegetarian recipe that uses Belazu rose harissa.

===Ingredients===
| 2 tablespoons Belazu Argan Oil 
| 1 large onion, peeled and chopped 
| 2 Cloves garlic, peeled and chopped 
| 1 teaspoon ground cumin 
| 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon 
| 1 tablespoon Belazu Rose Harissa 
| 3 plum tomatoes, peeled and chopped 
| 1 x 250g pack green beans, ends trimmed, cut into small pieces 
| 500g pumpkin peeled and cut into small cubes 
| 1 tablespoon plain flour 
| juice of one lemon 
| 2 Belazu preserved lemons, flesh removed and discarded, peel cut into strips 
| 2 tablespoons chopped fresh coriander, plus a few sprigs to garnish 
| 20 black olives, pitted 
| salt and freshly ground black pepper
===Method===


| Heat the argan oil in the casserole, dutch oven or tagine, add the onion and cook on a low heat to soften.
| Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute, then stir in the spices, the Harissa and half a teaspoon of freshly ground black pepper.
| Cook for 1 minute. Add the tomatoes and stir. Add the green beans and place the pumpkin cubes on top. Add 225ml of cold water, bring to the boil then simmer, covered for 25-30 minutes. Do not stir during this time.
| Check that the pumpkin is cooked - if not, stir and cook for a further 5 minutes.
| Make a paste of the flour and lemon juice and add 2 tablespoons of cooking liquid. Stir this into the casserole, then dot the lemon strips and olives on the top. 
| Cook for a further 5 minutes on a low heat, stirring gently. Finally, season and stir in the chopped coriander and garnish with the sprigs.
