===Description===

I bought some ras el hanout (couscous spice) from Birgit at The Spice Shop and have been messing about for ages finding recipes to use it in.  It's a wonderful warm spicy mix, reminiscent of Arabian cuisine.  I notice that Bart's Spices now produce one, but I doubt if it'll be as good as Birgit's!

===Ingredients===
| 1 tablespoon olive oil
| 1 onion, peeled and chopped
| 2 carrots, cut in half, lengthways and sliced thickly
| 310g skinless chicken breasts, cut into thin strips
| 3 teaspoons ras el hanout
| 400g can of plum tomatoes, chopped
| 300ml hot chicken stock (make from a Knorr stock cube if you wish)
| 410g can of chick peas or the equivalent amount of dried beans, cooked
| Handful of coriander leaves and stalks, chopped
| sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
===Method===


| Heat the oil in a large pan or wok, add the carrots and onions and sweat them down for 10 minutes
| Remove and reserve the carrots and onions
| Increase the heat and brown the chicken strips for 4 minutes or so
| Stir in the spice mix and continue to heat for a few more minutes
| Return the carrots and onions to the pan, then add the tomatoes, chickpeas and the stock. Season to taste with salt and pepper
| Bring to the boil, reduce the heat and simmer, covered for 25 minutes
===Serving suggestions===
Serve with crusty bread or couscous

Garnish with toasted almond flakes and sultanas
