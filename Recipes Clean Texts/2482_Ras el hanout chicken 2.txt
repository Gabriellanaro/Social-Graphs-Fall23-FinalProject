[[Image:Ras el hanout - couscous spice.jpg|300px|thumb|right|Ready to simmer]]
I bought some ras el hanout (couscous spice) from Birgit at The Spice Shop and have been messing about for ages finding recipes to use it in.  It's a wonderful warm spicy mix, reminiscent of Arabian cuisine.  I notice that Bart's Spices now produce one, but I doubt if it'll be as good as Birgit's!

This recipe is my variation on the original recipe, tailored to my taste and using ingredients available at the time. I can't help meddling with recipes!

===Ingredients===
| 1 tablespoon olive oil
| 1 onion, peeled and chopped
| 4 cloves of garlic peeled and crushed - or to taste
| 1 small head of celery, chopped, leaves as well if you have them
| 2 carrots, cut in half lengthways and sliced thickly
| 1 sweet pepper, any colour, chopped - I only had a half left. 
| 310g skinless chicken breasts, cut into thin strips
| 3 teaspoons ras el hanout
| 2 teaspoons of ground cumin seeds (white)
| 3 fresh red chillies, chopped
| 400g can of plum tomatoes, chopped
| 1 tablespoon tomato puree
| 300ml hot chicken stock (make from a Knorr stock cube if you wish)
| 1 410g can of chick peas or the equivalent amount of dried beans, cooked
| 1 teaspoon of dried parsley if no fresh is available.
| sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
===Method===


| Heat the oil in a large pan or wok, add a good grind of black pepper to it and then add the carrots, celery, onions and garlic and sweat them down for 10 minutes
| Remove and reserve.
| Increase the heat, add a little more oil if needed and brown the chicken strips for 4 minutes or so
| Stir in the spices, mix and continue to heat for a few more minutes
| Return the previously reserved onion mixture (from point 2) to the pan, add the tomatoes, sweet peppers, parsley, chillies, chickpeas and the stock. Season to taste with salt
| Bring to the boil, reduce the heat and simmer, covered for 25 minutes or so.
===Serving suggestions===
Serve with plain rice of couscous.
