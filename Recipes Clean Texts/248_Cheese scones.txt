This recipe makes lovely savoury cheese scones which are best eaten warm with butter. They don't keep that well so freeze any excess.

===Ingredients===
| 225g (8oz) self raising flour
| 55g (2oz) butter cut into small pieces
| 25 g (1 oz) Cheddar cheese, coarsely grated and cut into small pieces
| 1 egg yolk
| 150ml milk or buttermilk
| 1/2 level teaspoon of chilli powder
| 1/2 level teaspoon of mustard powder
| 1/2 level teaspoon of salt


===Mise en place===
* Preheat the oven to 220\u00b0 C (425\u00b0 F - gas 7)
===Method===


| Sift the flour into a mixing bowl, add the salt, chilli, mustard powder and butter.
| Rub the butter and into the flour then mix in the cheese and egg yolk.
| Add enough milk or buttermilk, a little at a time, mixing to to make a soft dough.
| This can also be done in a food processor.
| Tip out onto a floured worktop and knead lightly.
| Roll out to 2 cm (Â¾\") thick and them cut into rounds with a 5 cm (2\") pastry cutter or hand-roll them into balls for a more rustic looking scone..
| Brush the tops of the scones with a little milk.
| Place onto a lightly greased baking tray and bake for 12 to 15 minutes or until they have risen and turned golden.
===Variations===
Try different cheeses and adding some chopped fresh herbs such as sage or chives.
