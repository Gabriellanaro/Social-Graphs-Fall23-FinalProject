===Description===

This recipe is brought to you, courtesy of Nik & Edwina's Cookbook.

I don't think that Nik's description can be bettered, so here it is:

\"We pooled our Amazon tokens in Christmas 2011 and bought an ice cream maker, and we've had great fun with it ever since (see also Carbonara Ice Cream with Mange Tout and Frozen Yoghurt with a Hint of Coconut).

This recipe is adapted from Pushpesh Pant's India Cookbook, but lighter than usual because of the skimmed milk, and it uses a lot less sugar.   It is normally served in small dome shaped moulds, but also works as scooped ice cream that is not too melted. 

We have discovered that if you have an ice cream maker that this also works really well. The timings can be shorter, but it does maintain that complexity yet is lighter.\"

===Ingredients===
| 1 litre half fat  milk 
| 55g caster sugar 
| 3 cardamom pod, split
| 125ml double cream, whipped until firm but not stiff 
| 1-2 teaspoons rosewater according to taste
===Method===


| Put the milk and cardamom pod in a large heavy based saucepan, bring to the boil and simmer for 25 minutes or until reduced to 750ml 
| Add the sugar, and stir well. Return to heat and boil for a further 15 minutes or until reduced to 500ml. Allow to cool fully, leaving the cardamom pod in the milk 
| When cool, remove the cardamom and whisk in the cream and rosewater. Either put into an ice cream maker, or freeze in small moulds for 6-8 hours
