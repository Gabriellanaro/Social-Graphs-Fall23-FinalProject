===Description===

This recipe requires a food processor.

I tried a variation of our buttery homemade shortcrust pastry with just a tablespoon of Taste Sensation Well Matured Cheese Powder and it was spectacular.  Half went on two chicken pies, the other half on some home made sausage rolls.

Most people would probably not have cheese powder in their kitchens, so about 100g of finely grated cheddar cheese would probably do as a substitute.  Try the cheese powder if you can, you will not be disappointed, I promise you!
===Ingredients===

| 250g plain flour, sifted through a sieve
| Â¼ teaspoon sugar - icing sugar is best
| 6 g salt
| 1 heaped tablespoon of Taste Sensation Well Matured Cheese Powder
| 100g salted butter, cut into cubes
| 75g iced water
===Mise en place===

* Preheat your oven to 200\u00b0 C (400\u00b0 F - gas 6), [fan oven 180\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]

===Method===


| Tip everything other than the water into a food processor with a blade
| Pulse briefly 6 times to combine the ingredients
| Add the water while pulsing until the 'sound changes' and the mixture starts to form rice-like pieces
| Check all of the ingredients have combined properly than mould the contents into a dough
| Wrap the pastry in cling-film and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes to allow the gluten to react and give the pastry a stretchy texture
| Roll out and use as your recipe dictates - brush with egg or milk for a glaze if required
| Bake for 20 to 25 minutes in the top half of the oven
===Serving suggestions===
Worked really well on a chicken pies and sausage rolls
