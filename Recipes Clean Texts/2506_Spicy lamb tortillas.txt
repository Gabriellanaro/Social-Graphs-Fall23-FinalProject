This another of my variations of shepherd's pie with spicy lamb and pine nuts, another favourite from Sam & Sam Clark who run the [http://www.moro.co.uk/ Moro restaurant].

Take a tortilla, add the filling, spring onions, cucumbers and sour cream, roll it up and enjoy. The idea came from crispy duck pancakes.

Fillings of this style is likely to originate from the Middle East.

===Ingredients===
|Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
|25g butter
|2 tablespoons olive oil
| 6 cherry tomatoes, cut in half
|1 medium onion, finely chopped
|1/2 a teaspoon of freshly ground cinnamon
|Good pinch freshly grated nutmeg
|Good pinch freshly ground black pepper
|3 seeds from 3 green cardamom pods, ground to a powder
|3 freshly ground cloves
|250g good quality minced lamb
|50g pine nuts, dry toasted in a frying pan
|1 tablespoon tomato puree
|4 tablespoons fresh chopped parsley
|1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh mint
|1 tablespoon lime juice
| 
| For the pancakes
| Half a cucumber, peeled and sliced or julienned
| 6 spring onions, peeled and sliced or julienned 
| 1 packet of tortillas
| 125ml sour cream
===Method===


| '''For the filling;''' Add the butter and olive oil to a pan on a meduim/high heat. Add the onions when the butter begins to froth turn the heat down slightly and cook until caramelised - about 10 minutes
| Add the spices and stir well and cook for a minute
| Add the lamb and cook for about 8 minutes or until browned
| Drain any excess fat at this stage
| De-glaze the pan with the lime juice and 1 tablespoon of water
| Add the pine nuts, tomato puree, halved cherry tomatoes, mint and parsley and season to taste with salt and freshly ground black pepper and heat for a few minutes
| Pour the filling into a preheated bowl
| Warm the tortillas for a few minute of so in the microwave or as directed on the packet
===Serving suggestions===

At the table, fill each tortilla with a little filling, some sliced cucumber, spring onions and a dollop of sour cream. You may need to cut the tortillas in half.

===Variations===

Instead of tortillas, try:
* Lettuce leaves
* Chinese cabbage leaves
* Chinese crispy duck filo pastry pancakes
