===Description===


This North African-style recipe is another chance to use your harissa paste and it can be cooked in a traditional tagine or a normal casserole dish.

===Ingredients===
| 2 regular red onions, sliced 
| 2 tablespoons Belazu extra virgin olive oil 
| 500g cubed stewing beef 
| 1 large onion, sliced 
| 2 garlic cloves, crushed
| 1 small stick of cinnamon
| 2 tablespoons Belazu Rose Harissa 
| large pinch of saffron 
| 1 teaspoon salt 
| freshly ground black pepper 
| 600ml beef stock 
| 500g sweet potatoes, cut into chunky slices and par boiled 
| 2 beef tomatoes, sliced 
| handful of fresh coriander and parsley leaves


===Mise en place===
* Preheat the oven to 160\u00b0 C (325\u00b0 F - gas 3)
===Method===


| Heat a large flameproof casserole or tagine base and fry the beef for about 5 minutes, stirring until it's browned all over. 
|''If using a tagine, check that it fits in the oven before starting. If not, simply cover the dish with foil and cook''.
| Add the onion and garlic and cook for another 5 minutes. Add the Harissa, saffron, salt and cinnamon stick and season well with freshly ground black pepper. Pour the stock over and then bring to the boil.
| Cover and cook in the oven for 90 minutes until the beef is tender.
| Increase the oven to 190C/275F/gas 5.
| Arrange the potatoes and tomatoes on the top of the beef and cook for 20 more minutes until tender. Serve sprinkled with fresh coriander and the fresh parsley leaves.
