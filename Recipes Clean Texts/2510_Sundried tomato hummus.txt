 The Judge 
===Description===


Hummus is a great item to take with you for lunch or for a snack. Bring along dippable veggies, such as baby carrots and broccoli, to eat with the delicious hummus

===Ingredients===
| 2 x 400g cans chickpeas, rinsed and drained 
| 1/3 cup thick Greek yogurt 
| ¼ cup tahini (sesame seed paste) 
| 3 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed 
| ½ cup chopped and drained sundried tomatoes packed in oil 
| 1 teaspoon dried oregano leaves 
| 2 teaspoons lemon juice
| Grated zest from ¼ lemon
| Pinch of salt
===Method===


| Process the chickpeas, yogurt, tahini, and garlic in food processor until smooth.
| Stir in sun-dried tomatoes and herbs; season to taste with salt, lemon juice and zest.
| Refrigerate for two hours before serving.
===Variations===
As I did, you can blitz the sundried tomatoes with the chickpeas to get a more blended version.
