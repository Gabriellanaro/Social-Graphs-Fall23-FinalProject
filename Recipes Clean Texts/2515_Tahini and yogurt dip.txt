Another tahini dip variation that can be used as a dip for pitta breads, a dressing for salads, a side dish to accompany falafel or just eaten as a snack!

The proportion of tahini to yogurt is personal taste; I prefer about 3:1, yogurt to tahini.

Be bold and experiment with the quantities to come up with your personal dip.

===Ingredients===
| 100 ml plain yogurt
| 30 ml tahini
| Juice of 1 lemon
| Zest of ¼ a lemon
| 1 clove Garlic, peeled and crushed
| ¼ teaspoon sumac powder
| ¼ teaspoon sea salt (crushed in a mortar and pestle if very coarse)
'''For garnish'''
* 1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh parsley
* Pinch of paprika powder

===Method===


| Whisk everything together until you reach the desired consistency
| If you use more tahini you may want to add a little water
===Serving suggestions===
Place in a serving bowl and serve chilled, sprinkle a pinch of paprika powder over the top for a touch of colour and garnish with parsley
===Chef's tip===
Don't worry if you can't get sumac, it will still be good without it. It's there to add an extra sour note.
