===Description===

This tagine recipe is from Algeria, and not from Morocco, and better for it.

===Ingredients===
| 90 ml oil
| 2 onions, finely chopped
| Garlic to taste, crushed
| 900 g shoulder of lamb, cut into 5 cm cubes
| Zest of 1 preserved lemon, cut into 2 cm pieces
| 1½ teaspoons salt
| ½ teaspoon ground black pepper
| 1 x 5 cm cinnamon stick
| 12 globe artichoke hearts, cut in half
===Method===


| Heat the oil in a large pan, add the onion and garlic and saut\u00e9 for 2-3 minutes, stirring often.
| Add the lamb and continue to cook for a further 10 minutes until the lamb is brown on all sides.
| Add the lemon zest, salt, pepper, cinnamon stick and enough hot water to cover by about 5 cm.  
| Bring to the boil, reduce the heat, cover and simmer for 30 minutes.
| Add the artichokes and cover and simmer for a further 30-40 until the lamb is cooked.
| Discard the cinnamon stick and spoon the tagine into a serving dish.
===Serving suggestions===
Serve with rice pilav or couscous.
===Chef's notes===
Artichokes are not available all year round in the UK and they tend to be expensive.  For this recipe, which requires 12 hearts, I would use the pre-prepared preserved ones that are readily available, as they save time, money and hassle.
