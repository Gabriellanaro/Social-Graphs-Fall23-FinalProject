===Description===

Anne made this for me as a surprise, and very good it was too.

You could make this with one large [https://www.cookipedia.co.uk/cgi-bin/cc.pl?cftk=2#jump chicken breast] each.
===Ingredients===

| 4 small chicken breasts
| 80 g sliced pancetta
| 50 g strong cheddar cheese
| 2 cloves of garlic, peeled and crushed
====sauce====
===Ingredients===NB
| 400g passata (1 packet)
| 1 small onion, peeled and chopped
| Freshly ground black pepper
| 1 tablespoon olive oil
| 2 teaspoons herbes de provence
===Mise en place===

* Preheat the oven to 180\u00b0 C (350\u00b0 F - gas 4), [fan oven 160\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]

===Method===


| Slice the chicken breasts to make pockets in them
| Mix the cheese with the crushed garlic and stuff the chicken breasts with this mixture
| Wrap in pancetta and close with a cocktail stick
| Bake for 30 minutes at  180\u00b0 C, checking after 15 minutes
| Ideally place on a sheet of bake o glide as it's easier to use any of the cheese that might leak out.  It just seems to stick to tin-foil and be wasted.
| Meanwhile, saute the onions for 5 minutes in olive oil that has had a pinch of black pepper added to it
| Mix in the herbes de provence
===Serving suggestions===
Serve the chicken breasts and tomato sauce with brown rice and green beans
