This could not be easier - garlic perfection!

Garlic flavoured chips; lovely!  Saw this idea in a Gordon Ramsey Sunday Dinners TV program and as we always make our French fries in an air fryer, this was a no-brainer.

A full bulb of garlic sliced in half is plenty - wrap the other half in cling film for the next time!
===Ingredients===

| Half a bulb of garlic - sliced sideways to reveal all the cloves
| 4 medium sized potatoes
| 2 tablespoons olive oil
| Pinch of sea salt
| Pinch of ground black pepper

===Method===


| Peel the potatoes
| Cut them into French fries - we use a Sopito Stainless Steel Potato Cutter
| Rinse the chips well under running water
| Leave them soaking in salted water until you are ready to cook them
| Dry the potato chips in a tea-towel or a salad spinner
| Cook them at your air fryer's hottest temperature [200\u00b0 C / 220\u00b0] for 35 minutes or until golden.
| Shake the cloves out of the 'shell' of the garlic bulb. Discard the shell and keep the golden garlic cloves to serve with the chips - Yum!

===Chef's notes===
This time of year, locally we are limited to new potatoes but in season, Cara, Markies, Agria, Mozart and Maris Piper make the best chips. üçüüçüüçü
