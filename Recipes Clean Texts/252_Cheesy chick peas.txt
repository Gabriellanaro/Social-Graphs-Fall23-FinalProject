Cheesey peas!

===Description===


This recipe comes from my mum's cookery notes, written long before cheesy-peas existed, or before the Fast Show, at least.

Using dried chick peas, this recipe is very economical, though it does require preparing the day before you want to cook it.

===Ingredients===

| 225 g (8 oz) dried chick peas or 2 x 400g cans of tinned chick peas
| 25 g (1 oz) butter or olive oil
| 1 large onion, peeled and sliced
| 225 g (8 oz) raw spinach leaves, chopped
| 450 g (1 lb) fresh tomatoes, chopped into 8 pieces each
| 1 teaspoon Unsmoked paprika
| 1 teaspoon freshly ground cumin seeds
| 1 teaspoon dried oregano
| Â½ teaspoon chilli powder
| 100 g (4 oz) mature cheddar cheese
| Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
'''garnish'''
===Ingredients===NB
| 1 small pot Greek yogurt
| A few pinches of unsmoked paprika powder


===Method===



| add the presoaked chick peas to a large saucepan, cover with cold water and bring to the boil - skim any scum from the surface
| Lower the heat and simmer for 45 minutes or until tender to the pinch
| Drain, reserving 200 ml (1/2 pint) of the cooking water for later.
| Remove about half of the chick peas, add to a food processor with a metal blade and blend to a puree, using as much of the reserved cooking liquor as needed to make a smooth paste.
| Meanwhile heat the butter or olive oil in a large pan and gently saut\u00e9 the onions for 8 minutes until transparent.
| Add the cumin powder and the remaining whole chick peas and cook for 2 minutes.
| Add the chopped tomatoes, chopped spinach, pureed chick peas, herbs and spices and seasoning.
| Bring to the boil and simmer for 5 minutes.
| Remove from the heat and stir in the grated cheese.
===Serving suggestions===
Serve immediately, topped with yogurt, sprinkled with a pinch of paprika powder.

===Chef's notes===
You can always rehydrate loads of chick-peas and then freeze them so you have an almost instant supply, rather than having to wait overnight.
