===Description===

Everyone has tried pork spare ribs, well this is the man-sized version - I have adapted Jamie Oliver's \"Daisy Mays barbecue Ribs\" from Jamie's great \"America book\" (ISBN 0718154762).  We had similar ribs to this at Bodean's Barbecue Restaurant, by The Tower of London, after a [http://www.walks.com/London_Walks_Home/Saturdays_Walks/default.aspx#12939 Jack The Ripper walk] with some great friends of ours.

This recipe takes 8 hours to cook, so make sure that you allow enough time!

Ask your butcher for 'beef short ribs from the plate', or Argentine ribs. You don't want back ribs as these are not the same.  I understand from talking to a butcher that this particular cut of beef is also known as 'Jacob's ladder'.

===Ingredients===
| A halved 4 bone rack of beef short ribs 'from the plate', (about 1kg)
| 5 tablespoons American squeezy mustard
'''there's the rub'''
* 2 teaspoons chilli powder (or to taste)
* 4 tablespoons Spanish smoked paprika
* ½ tablespoon sea salt
* ½ tablespoon ground black pepper
* 2 tablespoons tomato pur\u00e9e
* 2 tablespoons olive oil
* 2 tablespoons ruby port
'''here's the marinade'''
* 4 tablespoons muscovado sugar
* 2 tablespoons good honey, warmed in the microwave for a few seconds to make it runny
* 1 tablespoon butter
* 1 beef Oxo cube, crumbled
* 2 tablespoons water

===Mise en place===
* Preheat the oven to 120\u00b0 C (250\u00b0 F - gas ½)

===Method===

| Make shallow criss-cross cuts on the meats side of the ribs.
| Mix the rub ingredients together in a bowl and mix well.
| Paint this all over the meat, getting it into all of the cuts and areas where your butcher has removed excess fat.
| If you have the time, place the ribs in a Lock and Lock style box and leave in a cool lace for a few hours before you start the cooking process.
| Pop the ribs in a lightly greased roasting tray, bone-side down, cover the tin with a layer of baking foil and roast for 6 hours.
| After 6 hours, remove the tin-foil covering, drain and reserve and refrigerate the juices, they make a wonderful chilli-beef dripping!
| Gently heat the marinade ingredients in a small pan, stirring until you have a liquid mix.
| Tear a few large sheets of really strong tin-foil (Bacofoil Classic is ideal as it's so thick and strong).
| Put the ribs in the foil, bone-side up and paint the marinade all over with a silicone brush.  
| Fold the foil over so you have a sealed parcel.
| Wrap in the second sheet of foil and put back in the roasting tray for a further hour.
| After the hour in the foil parcel, increase the heat to 140\u00b0 C (257\u00b0 F - gas 1), fold back the foil roast the ribs, uncovered and roast for another 40 minutes, basting often with the syrupy marinade.
| Remove and rest for at least 15 minutes before serving.

===Chef's notes===
I've found it difficult to obtain beef short ribs from anywhere but a specialist butchers and even then, they needed to be ordered in advance.  Today, I was delighted to discover F. Conisbee specialist butchers had them in stock. 4 Argentine ribs for \u00a321.04.  Robert cut them in half again lengthwise with the bandsaw. One of these half-ribs per person is plenty!
