The perfect match of flavours, even if I say so myself.

===Description===

Testing out my recent purchase of Taste Sensation Chili Cheese marinade ad I thought I would give it a go with popcorn.  Wow!

Fantastic flavours; it's quite hot, has a hint of saltiness with the cheese and yet it's also quite sweet.  A winner.
===Ingredients===

| 3 tablespoons popping corn
| 12 tablespoons olive oil
| 1 tablespoon Taste Sensation Chili Cheese marinade

===Method===


| Heat the oil in a large heavy based pot for a minute or so
| Drop the popcorn into the pot and shimmy the pot to coat the popcorn evenly with oil
| Cover with a spatter guard - this stops the corn and the fat from going everywhere and also allows the moisture to escape, which a pan lid would not
| A tea towel works just as well, but take care it does not catch fire!
| Once most of the corn has popped, remove from the heat and shake into a Lock & Lock box
| Add a tablespoon of Taste Sensation Chili Cheese marinade to the Lock & Lock box, cover and shake like mad to cover the popcorn.
| Eat and enjoy!
