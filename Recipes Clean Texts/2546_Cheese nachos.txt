===Description===

Another favourite snack or meze that can easily become the main meal.  Serve it with a selection of chilled, sliced vegetables such as bell peppers, carrots or celery to make it seem a little healthier!

If you like these then you'll love Frito pie or Easy frito pie!

===Ingredients===
| 200g packet of plain tortilla chips
| 2 large tomatoes, chopped
| 1 portion of minced beef for tacos, excluding the taco shells or trays
| 125 g mozzarella, Monterey Jack or Cheddar cheese, crumbled, grated or cut into small pieces
| 2 spring onions, chopped on the diagonal
| 1 small pot of sour cream
| 3 tablespoons pickled jalape\u00f1o chillies (optional)
| A few torn basil leaves or other herbs that are to hand (optional)


===Mise en place===
* Preheat the oven to  200\u00b0 C (400\u00b0 F - Gas mark 6)

===Method===


| Prepare the minced beef for tacos - making it on the dry side, draining any excess liquid once cooked or you'll have soggy nachos
| Tip the tortilla chips out onto a large non-stick oven tray and distribute the minced beef and chopped tomatoes amongst the tortillas
| Sprinkle with the crumbled cheese
| Cook in the oven or grill for about 5 minutes or until the cheese has melted
| Keep you eye on the tortillas as they can burn easily
===Serving suggestions===

Top with the spring onions and torn herbs

Serve with sour cream and guacamole
