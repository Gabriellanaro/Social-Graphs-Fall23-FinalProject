===Description===

This recipe was kindly added by Corbett Bacon

It would make an excellent starter or addition to a meze.

===Ingredients===

| 1 baguette
| 1 boneless chicken breast
| 3 cooked sausage patties (see Chef's notes)
| 110g [4 oz] of cream cheese
| 75g [3 oz] of Riesling wine
''' garnish'''
===Ingredients===NB
| 10 green olives
| Salt
| Tabasco
===Method===



| Slice the baguette on the bias, (at an angle) about Â¼ inch slices.
| The slices can be toasted on a baking sheet, or grilled just enough to lightly toast the pieces.
| Pan fry the boneless chicken breast in olive oil with just a little salt and pepper.
| Allow the cooked chicken to cool.
| Dice the chicken into large pieces and place into a food processor.
| Add all of the ingredients and blend until smooth; it should take about one minute.
| Refrigerate for an hour before serving.
===Serving suggestions===
When you are ready to serve, add a teaspoon of the pate to the baguette slices.

Top with a slice of green olive.

===Chef's notes===
I've not seen sausage patties in the UK but the filling from cooked breakfast sausages or even herby burgers would be a good substitute. --Jerry, aka Chef
