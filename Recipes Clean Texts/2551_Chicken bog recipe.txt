The Judge 

Chicken bog is a pilau dish made of rice, chicken, celery, spices, and often sausage. Loris, South Carolina celebrates an annual festival called the \"Loris Bog-Off\". 

Chicken bog is made in different ways in different places, but it is perhaps found most often in the Pee Dee and Low country regions of South Carolina.

===Ingredients===
| 1 very large whole chicken 2.2kg to 2.7 kg (5lb to 6 lb)
| 1 medium onion
| 1 green sweet pepper
| 110g (4 oz) butter
| 900 g (2 lb) long grain white rice (basmati rice is good)
| 110g (4 oz) bacon
| 6 cups (1.5 litres / 2.6 pints) chicken stock / chicken broth
| sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
===Method===


| Remove the parson's nose from the chicken.
| Use a heavy pot with lid (use lid while cooking for all steps except the bacon.)
| Put chicken in pot and cover with hot water. Be sure there is enough water so that there will be at least six cups of broth after cooking chicken. 
| Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer until chicken is very tender (an hour or more).
| While the chicken is cooking: Slice and chop one bell pepper into very small pieces. Put 4 cups of rice into a bowl, cover with cold water and let soak.
| When chicken is very tender, remove pot from stove and let cool until the chicken can be handled.
| Take chicken from pot, and pull meat from bones in large pieces; do not cut it up. Discard any fat heavy skin.
| Pour broth from pot into a bowl (if chicken was very fat and broth is very fat, pour off about 1 cup of fat from broth).
| Wash pot, then put bacon in pot and cook slowly until bacon is crisp.
| Take bacon from pot and drain; leave bacon grease in pot.
| Put in chopped onion, green pepper and brown slightly.
| Add 6 cups chicken broth to pot, and season to taste with salt and pepper (at least a tablespoon of each -- use a heavy hand since rice will absorb salt).
| Increase heat, bring broth to a boil, and put chicken in pot.
| Drain rice and put rice in pot.
| Add the butter and mix well. Reduce heat and simmer very slowly for about an hour.
===Variations===
Use 225 g (8 oz) of spicy sausages or smoked sausages instead of the bacon.
