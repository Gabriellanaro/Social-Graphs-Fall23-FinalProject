===Method===


| In a wok or large frying pan, heat the oil and add a grind of black pepper then gently cook the onions for 20 minutes until soft - don't brown them.
| Meantime, in a separate pan, add a small amount of the oil from the onions, just to prevent the meat from sticking and add the pork, beef and salt. Cook for 20 minutes also.
| Drain the meat of any excess fat.
| Add the onions to the casserole and mix with the meat.
| Stir in the chili powder, hot pepper sauce, paprika powder, cumin, oregano, cocoa powder and cayenne pepper.  Cook for 5 minutes, stirring often.
| Add the beef stock and tomato juice, bring to the boil, reduce the heat, cover and simmer for 1 hour.
| Taste and adjust for seasoning and then simmer for a further 30 minutes.
| Add the garlic and thicken with cornmeal if required. Add the beans and simmer for 5 minutes then serve.
===Chef's notes===
As I did not have quite enough minced beef and minced pork, I chopped up a large chicken breast6 and added that, cooking at the same time as the other meats.
