===Description===

Ok, I had better fess up, this is another of my experiments, documented so it can be easily replicated if it is a success. This recipe is not cooked sous-vide in the way you would normally.  I don't have a 6 litre sous-vide cooker, I've used my home-made sous-vide cooker and instead of cooking in a vacuum sealed bag, I've just used the slow cooker with scrunched up baco-foil to provide a better seal.  This could be simply replicated in a slow cooker that has a very accurate temperature setting, should such a thing exist outside of my house!

If you are luck enough to have a sous-vide cooker that can accomodate 6 litres I would be inclined to premix everything in a bowl first and vacuum seal but manually seal the container before liquid is drawn into the vacuum sealer. 

The recipe is very similar to the original , The Manhattan Chili Co's famous \u200eChili con carne numero uno.  The main differences are that I've used leeks instead of onions and altered the cooking method .

''This was not very successful - the prolonged cooking time make the oregano and cinnamon far too strong - stick to the original - it's far better!''

''1 cup in this recipe represents 237 ml''

===Ingredients===
| Â¼ cup of olive oil
| Freshly ground black pepper
| 4 large leeks, trimmed and chopped (4 cups)
| 500 g (1 lb 2 oz) minced beef (''ground beef'')

| 2 teaspoons sea salt
| 4 heaped tablespoons of unsmoked paprika powder
| 2 scant fresh cumin seeds, toasted and ground to a powder in a coffee grinder
| 2 scant tablespoons dried Mexican oregano
| 2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder (Green & Black's or similar quality product)
| 1 large whole stick of cinnamon bark to be removed and discarded after cooking
| 1.5 teaspoons of ancho chilli powder
| 2 teaspoons of chilli chipotle flakes
| Good shake of Louisiana hot pepper sauce

| 3 cups beef stock
| 8 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed

===Method===



| In a wok or large frying pan, heat the oil and add a grind of black pepper then gently cook the leeks for 20 minutes until soft - don't brown them.
| Meantime, in a separate pan, add a small amount of the oil from the onions, just to prevent the meat from sticking and add the pork, beef and salt. Saute for 10 minutes, draining any liquid after cooking.
| Add the onions and meat to the sous-vide or slow cooker.
| Stir in the chili, hot pepper sauce, paprika powder, cumin, oregano, cocoa powder and cayenne pepper, beans and crushed garlic, beef stock and passata, set the cooker to 65\u00b0 C [149\u00b0 F], seal as best you can and cook for 24 hours.
| Taste for seasoning and thicken with cornmeal if required.

I'm using this as the basis for Frito pie.
