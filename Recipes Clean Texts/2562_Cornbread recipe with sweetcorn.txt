===Description===

Cornbread, great with tex-mex dishes, seafood, gumbo, jambalaya, hoppin' john or just as a snack.

===Ingredients===
| 375 g (13 oz) plain flour, sieved
| 225 g (8 oz) yellow cornmeal, not masa harina
| 110 g (4 oz) sugar
| 4 tablespoons baking powder
| 1 tablespoon sea salt
| 480 ml (17 fl oz) cold milk
| 2 free-range eggs
| 110 g (4 oz) melted butter or ghee, plus extra for greasing
| 198g can of sweetcorn


===Mise en place===
* Preheat the oven to 200\u00b0  C (400\u00b0  F - gas 6) Grease a 23 cm (9 \") baking tray with melted butter or ghee
===Method===


| In a large bowl, mix all the ingredients together except for the sweetcorn kernels.  Continue mixing until you have a smooth, even batter
| Drain the sweetcorn, add to the mixture and mix well to combine the kernels
| Pour into the greased pan and bake for about 20 minutes at the top of the oven
| It should be golden brown and springy to the touch
| Allow to cool for 15 minutes before attempting to cut
===Variations===
For a hot cheesy cornbread, add 110 g (4 oz) of shredded Cheddar or Monterey Jack cheese and a big handful of drained, pickled jalape\u00f1o chillies - yum!
