A crayfish quiche, spiced up with chillies. It's great.

I chose to use 50% crayfish and 50% peeled prawns but only because I wanted a variety of sea food for another dish.  You could easily use 100% of either.

===Ingredients===
| 1 Basic flan case
| 85 g (3½ oz) crayfish tails
| 85 g (3½ oz) peeled prawns
| Splash of black rice vingar or balsamic vinegar
| 2 pickled chillies, deseeded and finely chopped
| 2 free range eggs
| 6 tablespoons milk
| 1 tablespoon wholemeal flour
| 3 tablespoons grated Cheddar cheese
| A splash of Tabasco sauce
| Salt and freshly ground black pepper
| 1 fresh tomato, sliced for garnish


===Mise en place===

* Preheat the oven to 200\u00b0 C (400\u00b0 F - Gas 6)

===Method===


| Add the crayfish tails, prawns, chopped chillies and a splash of Black rice vinegar to a bowl, mix well to distribute the chillies evenly and leave to marinate for 20 minutes whilst the oven warms.
| Follow the recipe for the Basic flan case
| Add the eggs, milk, flour, grated cheese, Tabasco sauce and seasoning to a bowl
| With an electric whisk, combine the ingredients so they are well mixed.
| Blind bake the case.
| Arrange the crayfish tails, prawns and chillies in the base of the flan
| Pour over the egg mixture
| Arrange the sliced tomatoes on the top and bake for a further 30 minutes
