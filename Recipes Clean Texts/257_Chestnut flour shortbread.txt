Made this a few years ago, thanks Julia.  Can't find chestnut flour anymore.  Maybe I can make some next season using freshly roasted chestnuts?

===Description===

A short time ago I bought some chestnut flour, but wasn't sure what to do with it.  Someone suggested using to substitute some of the plain flour in shortbread, so this is what I have done.

===Ingredients===
| 300g butter
| 120g caster sugar
| 300g plain flour
| 100g chestnut flour
| 60g rice flour or ground rice
| 10 g Sugar for rolling and sprinkling


===Mise en place===
* Preheat the oven to 140\u00b0 C (257\u00b0 F - gas 1), [fan oven 120\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]
===Method===


| Cream the butter and sugar together until smooth.
| Add the flour and work into a dough.
| Roll out into a rectangle or a round on a sugared work surface until it is 1cm thick.
| Place on a greased baking tray and cut into fingers or triangles.
| Allow to chill in the fridge for 20 minutes.
| Bake for 50-60 minutes and when cooked, place on a wire rack.
| Sprinkle with sugar and allow to cool.
===Variations===
I sprinkled my biscuits with lavender sugar. Try various flavoured sugars.
