===Description===

[[Image:Easy potato waffles.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Waffle iron and one cup of cooked potatoes.]]
This recipe couldn't be easier, more natural and healthy.  The trick is not to overfill the waffle iron.

The quantities here are perfect for a J.M. Posner Belgian Waffle Maker

===Ingredients===

| 250 g (1 cup) of cooked potato (boiled)
| Spray of Olive oil
| Pinch of salt
===Mise en place===

* Using a spray or an oiled kitchen paper, coat both surfaces of the waffle iron with a very thin film of oil before switching on the iron.
* Turn on the waffle iron and allow to get to temperature (normally the green light comes on)

===Method===


| If the potatoes are very wet, press them into a sieve to release any excess water.  This is especially necessary if using  defrosted frozen boiled potatoes.
| Add a pinch of salt to the potato mix
| Place the cooked boiled potato in the centre of the iron and close firmly to squish the potato evenly over the iron.
| Cook for 15 to 18 minutes or until golden and crispy.
===Variations===
Drop a knob of butter onto the top of the waffle for the last few minutes of cooking.

===Chef's notes===
From the experiments I have carried out, mashing the potatoes beforehand is not necessary and actually makes more of a mess, especially if the mix is rather liquid.
