This in now becoming an obsession - I'm now up to two a day (making quiches, not eating them!)

I love Frankfurters and quiches, so I thought I would combine the two.

The quantity used makes two quiches, but you could obviously halve the amounts if you only wanted to make one.

I guess the obvious thing to include would be mustard, but I wasn't too sure about that so used my favourite instead - Louisiana hot pepper sauce - use Tabasco sauce if you wish.

===Ingredients===
| 500 g (1 lb 2 oz) pack of ready made shortcrust pastry
| 350 g Frankfurters 1 pack, 10 in my packet
| 6 free range eggs
| 6 tablespoons of Greek-style yogurt
| 3 tablespoons of mascarpone cheese
| Splash of Louisiana hot pepper sauce
| 1 tablespoon of freshly chopped parsley
| Grind of black pepper
| Pinch of sea salt
| Splash of milk
| 2 large tomatoes, sliced


===Mise en place===
* Preheat the oven to 200\u00b0 C (400\u00b0 F - Gas 6) 

===Method===


| Roll the pastry out into two circles to fit your flan trays. Push-out flan dishes are the best for this I find (as long as your pastry doesn't leak)
| Blind bake the pastry for 10 minutes
| Add the eggs, cheese, yogurt and a splash of milk to a bowl, season with salt, pepper and your hot sauce
| Whisk up the mixture so the cheese and yogurt is well combined
| Cut the Frankfurters in half and arrange in the dishes
| Sprinkle the parsley into the mixture
| Divide the egg mixture between the two trays and top with sliced tomatoes
| Reduce the heat of the oven to 180\u00b0 C (350\u00b0 F - Gas 4)
| Bake for a further 40 minutes, leaving a little head-room as they tend to rise a bit - like a souffle
===Serving suggestions===

Serve hot or cold
