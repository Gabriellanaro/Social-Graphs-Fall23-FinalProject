[[Image:Sweet chestnuts.jpg|thumb|300px|right|This is what they look like. Don't buy them, just pick them up from under the tree]]
A very traditional stuffing to serve with the Christmas turkey which would go as well with the roast Christmas chicken.

I would be inclined to serve it as a side-dish, not as actual stuffing for the bird.

===Ingredients===
| 900 g (2 lb) whole raw chestnuts
| 284 ml (1/2 pint) vegetable stock
| 25 g (1 oz) butter
| A 'good pinch' of sugar
| Salt and pepper


===Mise en place===
* Oven temperature: 200\u00b0 C (400\u00b0 F - gas 6), [fan oven 80\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]
===Method===


| Slit the chestnuts
| Roast then in the oven for about 20 minutes
| Allow to cool a little
| Remove both the outer and inner skins, put the chestnuts into a stewpan, add the stock (no more than will barely cover them) and simmer them until they become tender
| Rub through a fine sieve or use a potato ricer or potato masher.
| Add the butter, salt and pepper and use as required.
