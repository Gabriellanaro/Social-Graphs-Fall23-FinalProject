A Frito pie typically consists of a small single-serving bag of Fritos (plain corn chips / tortilla chips), with a cup of chili poured over the top, usually finished up with grated cheese or onions and jalape\u00f1os and sour cream. Frito pies are popular in the Southwestern United States. 

This dish is similar to Cheese nachos and the original Easy frito pie.

===Ingredients===
| 150 g Fritos or other corn (maize) chips
| ¾ cup (175 ml) chopped onion
| 2 tomatoes, chopped
| 1 cup (240 ml) grated cheddar cheese
| 1 pound of ground beef
| taco seasoning
| 2½ cups (590 ml) chili (homemade or canned)
| 125 ml carton of sour cream
===Method===


| Brown the ground beef and season according to taco seasoning mix.
| Preheat oven to 350\u00b0 F (175\u00b0 C).
| Spread 2 cups of Fritos in a baking dish.
| Sprinkle half the onion , half the cheese and the chopped tomatoes over the Fritos.
| Combine ground beef with the chili and pour over the onion and cheese.
| Sprinkle the remaining Fritos, onion and cheese over the chili.
| Bake for 15 or 20 minutes and cheese is bubbly.
| Serve hot, garnish with sour cream.

===Serving suggestion===
Scatter a handful of pickled jalape\u00f1os over the top of the tortilla chips before baking.

An orange cut into thin segments (skin on) and baked separately makes an nice refreshing accompaniment to this dish.
