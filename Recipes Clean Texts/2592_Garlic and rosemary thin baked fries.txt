I thought these might taste like soap - nice though!
 

The Judge 


These garlic and rosemary flavoured thin fries would make a fabulous accompaniment for almost any dish, or even a snack on their own.  They are baked rather than fried so are possibly slightly healthy!

The recipe idea and the pictures come by courtesy of 'I believe I can fry' and this was the first recipe I chose from her collection after she gave us permission to share her ideas.

===Ingredients===
| 2 Russet potatoes, peeled and cut into thin fries
| A good splash of olive oil
| Â¼ teaspoon garlic powder
| 1 teaspoon rosemary leaves, finely chopped.
| The original recipe specified dried rosemary, I tend to use fresh rosemary as I have so much of it.  In a recipe like this it probably doesn't hurt to throw a few sprigs onto the baking tray just for the aroma, Jamie Oliver style.
| sea salt
| Black pepper


===Mise en place===
* Preheat the oven to 230\u00b0 C (450\u00b0 F - gas 8), [fan oven 210\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]
* Soak the thin cut fries in cold water for 10 minutes
===Method===


| Rinse and drain the chipped fries and pat dry on paper towels.
| Add the rosemary leaves and garlic powder and black pepper to the oil and mix well, a pestle and mortar will bring out the flavour of fresh rosemary leaves.
| Add the oil and potatoes to a large lock & lock-style box, close the lid and shake well to coat the fries.
| Spread the fries evenly on a foil-lined roasting tray.
| Bake for 30 minutes turning a few times.
===Serving suggestions===
Serve immediately, seasoned with sea salt.
