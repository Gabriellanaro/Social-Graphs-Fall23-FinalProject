Air frying is nicer

A few years ago this would have been great, but now I can get the same results using an air-fryer and a spray of olive oil.

It is years since I deep-fried anything so this is almost new territory for me.  Reading one of Ken Hom's early cookbooks gave me the impetus to try it again.  I'm glad I did, it was really good and not at all greasy.

This is really an aide-memoir for me; next time I would add a tablespoon of Old India Taco Seasoning for a bit more spice, and I would also hammer the chicken flat before slicing up.  This would enable less oil to be used (not so wasteful), and it would also give a shorter, more uniform cooking time. As it was, we had to cook all of the chicken pieces a little longer to be sure the largest pieces were properly cooked.

===Ingredients===

| 400g small chicken fillets
| 1 tablespoon lemon juice
| 1 tablespoon shaoxing rice wine vinegar - balsamic vinegar will be fine 
| 3 cloves of garlic, peeled and crushed
| A pinch of salt and black pepper
| 2 egg whites
| 2 tablespoons of cornflour
| 1 cup masa harina
| 1 to 2 cups sunflower oil
===Mise en place===

* Cut the chicken fillets into bite-sized pieces
* Add to a Lock & Lock box together with the crushed garlic, rice wine vinegar, lemon juice, salt and black pepper.
* Shake well to mix and refrigerate for an hour or more to allow the marinade to penetrate the meat.

===Method===


| Drain the chicken pieces in a colander and discard the marinade juices.
| Whisk the egg whites and cornflour in a bowl.
| Add the chicken pieces to the bowl and mix well. Refrigerate for 30 minutes.
| Add the cup of masa harina to a dry Lock and Lock box, close the lid and shake hard to coat the chicken.
| Heat a wok or frying pan with enough oil to just cover the chicken pieces.
| Heat to 176\u00b0 C [350\u00b0 F] (a 2.5cm [1\"] cube of bread should brown in 60 seconds.
| Fry the chicken pieces in 2 batches for about 4 minutes each batch.  Cut one of the largest pieces open to check that it is properly cooked.
| Serve immediately.
===Serving suggestions===
Chips and salad is probably the most usual accompaniment for this.  We had this with an unusual, but fantastic combination; garlic mushrooms and grilled tomatoes!
