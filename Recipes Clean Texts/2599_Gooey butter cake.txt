Gooey butter cake is a type of cake traditionally made in the U.S. city of St. Louis, Missouri, with a bottom layer of buttery yellow cake and a top layer of either egg and cream cheese, or butter and sugar.

I am not certain if you are able to buy yellow cake mix from UK supermarkets, but it can be bought on line from Lupe Pinto's Mexican deli

'''For the cake'''
===Ingredients===
| 517 g yellow cake mix 
| 115 g butter, melted 
| 2 large free range eggs
'''For the topping'''
===Ingredients===NB
| 1 teaspoon (5 ml) vanilla extract 
| 224 g cream cheese 
| 2 large free range eggs
| 1 teaspoon (5 ml) vanilla extract

* Preheat the oven to 180\u00b0C (350\u00b0F - Gas Mk 4 - Moderate/Medium)
===Method===


| In a large bowl, with a wooden spoon or a hand mixer combine the melted butter, 1 teaspoon vanilla extract and 2 of the eggs into an even mixture
| Lightly grease or spray a 23 cm x 33 cm (9\" x 13\") baking tray
| With a palette knife, spread the mixture out evenly onto the baking tray
| In a food processor, mix the cream cheese, the remaining 2 eggs and a teaspoons of vanilla extract

Not surprisingly, the cake should be gooey under the crust!
