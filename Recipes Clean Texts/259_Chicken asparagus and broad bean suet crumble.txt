Can't wait for asparagus season again...

===Description===

Made from produce purchased from the local gardens and butchers around Upwell.  Covered this with a fabulous suet crust that was like a savoury apple crumble crust!

As this will be for the two of us, I'm going to freeze half of the filling and make another pie, another day.
===Ingredients===

====pie filling====
===Ingredients===NB
| A large pinch of black pepper
| 2 tablespoons olive oil
| 2 tablespoons of olive oil from a bottle of sun dried tomatoes
| Two large onions, finely chopped
| 4 cloves of garlic, peeled and chopped
| 2 chicken chicken breasts, chopped into bite-sized chunks
| 1 can of cream of chicken soup
| A pinch of turmeric
| A pinch of salt
| A goodly pinch of whole fennel seeds
| 1 teaspoon dried parsley
| 1 teaspoon chicken stock mixed with 180 ml boiling
| A bag of broad beans, podded, about a good handful
| A bunch of asparagus, speed peel tough stalks ends.
| A large bunch of sage leaves
====Suet crust====
===Ingredients===NB
| 110 g suet
| 110 g self-raising flour
| 1 teaspoon baking powder
| pinch of sea salt
| pinch of freshly ground black pepper
| Enough water just to bind the mixture together, don't try and make a 'wet' pastry
===Mise en place===

* Preheat your oven to 200\u00b0 C (400\u00b0 F - gas 6), [fan oven 180\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour] so it is ready for the final 30 minutes of baking

===Method===
====filling====

| Heat the olive oil and add a pinch of black pepper
| Chop the onions and fry them in the olive oil until golden
| Add the garlic and stir fry for 3 minutes
| Add the chicken and fry for a few minutes, turning often
| Add the chicken soup a d the remaining ingredients, apart from the reserved asparagus tips, to a slow cooker set to low and slow cook for 2 hours, 30 minutes, stirring now and then
====suet crust====

| Rub the flour into the suet until you can't feel the lumps in the suet
| Add the salt and pepper and just enough water to bind the mixture so it can be squeezed into a ball without it falling apart again
| Roll the pastry out into a shape that will roughly cover your pie bowls
| Bake for 30 minutes

===Serving suggestions===
We served this with new potatoes, there was enough 'veg' in the pie filling to make a blanced meal
