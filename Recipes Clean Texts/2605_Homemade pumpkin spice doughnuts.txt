===Ingredients===

'''for the doughnuts:''''
===Ingredients===NB
| 2 large eggs
| ¾ cup sugar
| 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
| 1 cup organic pumpkin puree
| 4½ cups all purpose flour (plain flour)
| 2 teaspoons baking powder
| 1 teaspoon baking soda
| 1 teaspoon salt
| 1 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice (or a mixture of  nutmeg,ginger, and cinnamon)
| 1 can low-fat evaporated milk
| Canola oil for deep-frying
'''for the maple frosting:'''
===Ingredients===NB
| 1 tablespoon maple syrup
| 1 cup powdered sugar
| 2 tablespoons of almond milk
| ¼ teaspoon cinnamon powder
===Method===



| In a medium mixing bowl, beat eggs, sugar, and butter.
| Add pumpkin puree, mix in well.
| For the dry ingredients, combine the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and pumpkin spice.
| Begin to marry the pumpkin batter and alternate with the evaporated milk, folding in gently.
| Refrigerate the batter to firm for approx 1 hour before kneading.
| Turn onto a lightly floured work-surface and knead well.
| Roll to approximately ¾ inch in thickness.
| Cut with a 2½'' doughnut cutter. (Alternatively, cut with the small rim of any glass jar or cup and use a small bottle to cut out the hole.) 
| Fry doughnuts and doughnut holes, a few at a time, until golden (approximately 1-2 minutes on each side).
| Remove using a slotted spoon or a spider and allow the excess oil to drain on paper towels.
| For the icing, whisk together all ingredients in a medium mixing bowl.
| Spread over cooled doughnuts with a teaspoon (place on a wire rack over a sheet tray, if desired).
