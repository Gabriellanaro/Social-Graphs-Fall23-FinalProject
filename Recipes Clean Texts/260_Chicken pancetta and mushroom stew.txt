===Description===

This recipe is my husband's idea, and he did most of the work, but I could not resist meddling.  Ideal for using up chicken left over from the day before and only uses one pot, so no need for endless washing up.  Plain, simple and easy!

===Ingredients===
| 2 tablespoons olive oil
| 110g shallots, sliced - this is the net weight after peeling, topping and tailing
| 200g pancetta, cut into lardons
| Garlic, as much as you like, roughly chopped
| 250g carrots, peeled and coarsely chopped
| 300g small boiling/salad potatoes, washed and left whole
| 125g button mushrooms, wiped and left whole
| 75ml dry white wine
| 900ml hot chicken stock
| 170g frozen broad beans
| 150g peppers, sliced
| 1 tablespoon dried herbs of your choice
| 325g cooked chicken, coarsely shredded
===Method===


| Heat the olive oil in a shallow casserole or sauteuse and gently saut\u00e9 the shallots and pancetta, stirring from time to time.
| When the shallots are beginning to soften, stir in the garlic and cook for about 2 minutes.
| Add the carrots and potatoes and saut\u00e9 for a further 2 minutes until coated with the fat.
| Stir in the mushrooms, and add the white wine.
| Allow to cook for 3 minutes and add the hot stock.
| Reduce the heat a little, cover and allow to stew for about 20-25 minutes.
| Add the broad beans, peppers, herbs and the chicken, bring to the boil and simmer for 10 minutes.
===Serving suggestions===
Serve hot with a hunk of bread.
===Variations===
Use any left over fowl or game birds and substitute the wine for dry cider.  Any combination of vegetables will be fine so long as you take into consideration their various cooking times.
===Chef's notes===
Follow the RSPCA Think Pig Checklist to make sure that your pork has come from pigs that have been reared to higher welfare standards.
