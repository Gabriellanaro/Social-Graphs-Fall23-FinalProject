Nothing special, just hot, not tasty

===Description===

Lyndon Baines Johnson liked his chili very hot and with no beans.  Lady Bird Johnson's original recipe also contained suet but this was later omitted after LBJ's heart attack.

This is the healthier version of the famous chili con carne.

===Ingredients===
| 2 kg (4 lb) chuck steak, cubed and trimmed of fat or lean minced beef
| 1 large onion, peeled and chopped
| 2 Cloves of garlic, peeled and chopped
| 3 tablespoons oil for frying
| 1 teaspoon dried oregano 
| 1 teaspoon cumin seeds, ground to a powder in a coffee grinder or pestle and mortar
| 6 teaspoons red chilli powder
| 2 x 340 g cans of tomatoes
| 2 cups of hot water
| sea salt to taste
'''to garnish'''
* 20g Grated Cheddar cheese
* 20g Chopped spring onions

===Method===


| Heat the oil in a Dutch oven
| Add the garlic and stir-fry for a minute or so
| Add the onions and the meat and saut\u00e9 until the meat and the onions are cooked
| Add the remaining ingredients, bring to the boil, reduce and simmer for 1 hour
| Skim any fat from the surface
| Sprinkle with grated cheese and garnish with chopped spring onions
===Variations===
Serve it as he liked it, with saltine crackers and a glass of milk.  Bath Olivers dry water biscuits are a good equivalent for those on this side of the pond.
===Chef's notes===
You can skim the fat LBJ's way.  Allow to cool naturally, refrigerate and remove the fat when cold.

Reheat to serve.
