===Description===

To my mind this is about the pizza and the sauce, not the actual meatballs, hence using shop-made meatballs.  By all means '''make your own''' if you feel so inclined.

Use a pizza stone!  It makes such a difference.  Your pizzas will go from those soggy-based shop bought shockers, to Pizza Express perfection in one simple step!

===Ingredients===
| 1 portion pizza dough
| 300 g pack of cooked meatballs of your choice
| 150 g pack of mozzarella cheese
| large can tomatoes, chopped.
| A good glug of olive oil
| 1 onion, peeled and sliced
| 2 cloves garlic, crushed
| 1 dried chile de arbole, ground to powder in a coffee grinder or pestle and mortar (or ½ teaspoon chili powder)
| 125 ml red wine
| A pinch of sugar
| sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
| Fine yellow cornmeal for dusting


===Mise en place===
* Make the pizza dough as instructed
* If using a pizza stone, preheat the pizza stone under a very hot grill for about 20 minutes.  Place it about 8cm (3\") from the heat source.

===Method===
'''Meatball sauce'''

| Fry the onions and garlic in a few glugs of olive oil seasoned with black pepper until soft, about 10 minutes.
| Add the meatballs, tomatoes, red wine, chili and simmer until reduced and very thick - you don't want a wet pizza.
| As I have plenty of time on pizza day (Friday!) I make the sauce early in the afternoon and put it on the heat for 5 minute batches every hour or so, leaving it uncovered to 'dry-out' in between. You can of course just simmer to reduce, but you need to watch it and keep stirring all the time.
| Season to taste
'''Putting it together'''

| Preheat the grill to high as you can get it
| Set the pizza stone about 8 cm (3\") below the heat source or the pizza may burn
| Dust the work surface with yellow cornmeal and then stretch or roll the dough into two thin rounds
| Prick the pizza all over with a fork. This prevents it puffing up too much and burning while it is cooking
| Grill the pizza for about 2 minutes on one side only or until browned.
| Remove from the oven, flip over and ad the topping.
| Divide the meatballs and sauce between the two pizzas, cut the meatballs in half and spread over the pizza
| Cover with sliced mozzarella cheese, drizzle with a little olive oil and bake for for 3 to 5 minutes (depending on how hot your oven is) or until the cheese browns a little.  Watch it carefully as it's easy to burn at such a high heat.
| Serve!
===Chef's notes===
Lots of supermarkets do chopped tomatoes, flavoured with chili/basil/oregano etc, and though it's as easy to do this yourself, they are quite handy for pizza toppings.
