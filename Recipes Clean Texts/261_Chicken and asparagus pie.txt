A great combination that makes great gravy.  I always burn my mouth pigging this!

===Description===

[[Image:Pie for two.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Using the ingredients above, bake two separate 2 person pies on different days, each with half the filling and half a packet of pre-rolled pastry]]
A really tasty and attractive dish, this one.  If you can't be bothered to make chicken stock, rather than using a stock cube  you might be better off cheating and using a good quality tin of chicken & asparagus or chicken & mushroom soup.  I would omit the flour if you do it this way.

===Ingredients===
| A few home smoked bacon rashers, chopped - or just nice quality bacon.
| 500 g ( 1lb 2 oz) chicken breasts, diced.
| 1 onion, peeled and chopped
| 1 clove of garlic, peeled and crushed (optional)
| Olive oil for frying
| 2 tablespoons freshly chopped parsley
| 8 asparagus spears, chopped into 2.5 cm (1\") lengths
| Handful of mushrooms, brushed clean and sliced
| 284 ml (1/2 pint) chicken stock
| 2 tablespoons plain flour
| Sea salt and freshly milled black pepper
| 225g/8oz ready rolled puff pastry


===Mise en place===
* Preheat the oven to 200\u00b0 C (400\u00b0 F - Gas 6 - Moderately hot)
** If your electric oven has the options of upper, lower, both elements, use the lower element.
===Method===


| Take the pack of pastry out of the fridge and allow to reach room temperature before using (step 8)
| Heat a few tablespoons of olive oil in a pan or a wok and fry the onions (and garlic if using) for 3 minutes
| Season the flour with salt and pepper and toss the chicken pieces in the flour. 
| Add the chicken to the onions and brown, turning often.
| Arrange the chicken, bacon, onions, mushrooms and asparagus in an oven proof dish.
| Pour the chicken stock or soup over the ingredients.
| Roll out the pastry so it is large enough to cover your dish.
| Brush the edge of the dish with water to help the pastry stick.
| Trim away any excess and crimp the edge all the way round with the tines/prongs of a fork - I forgot to do this! A pastry wheel or crimper is also good for this eg [http://www.amazon.co.uk/Pastry-15-5cm-Polyamid-Guaranteed-quality/dp/B0030I1XW8/ref=sr_1_25?ie=UTF8&s=kitchen&qid=1280680434&sr=1-25 metal crimper] or [http://www.amazon.co.uk/Pastry-Cutter-Boxwood-Guaranteed-Quality/dp/B003NIGNLQ/ref=sr_1_34?ie=UTF8&s=kitchen&qid=1280680434&sr=1-34 wooden version]
| Cut a 1cm (½\") hole in the top to allow steam to escape or even better, put in a pie funnel.
| Bake for 25 to 30 minutes in the middle of the oven until the pastry is golden brown.
| Check after 20 minutes and if the crust looks as though it might be starting to burn, lay a sheet of tin foil over the top.
===Serving suggestions===

Serve with hot jacket potatoes.
