===Description===

This is a variation of the famous Mac & cheese recipe from ''Modernist Cuisine'' ISBN 978-0982761007. If you've read this Molecular gastronomy cookery book or its ''Home'' version you will understand why the measurement quantities are so exacting.

I'm using black bomber cheese and combining the pasta with cauliflower and broccoli.

===Ingredients===

| 160 ml Semi-skimmed milk
| 6.5g Sodium citrate 
| 170g Black bomber cheese, grated
| 120g Dried macaroni pasta
| 150g Cauliflower florets
| 150g Broccoli florets
| A few tomatoes
| Freshly chopped parsley
| Freshly chopped chives

===Method===


| Combine the milk and sodium citrate in a saucepan, mix well with a hand whisk and bring to a simmer
| Add the grated cheese to the simmering milk a handful at a time blending with an immersion blender every time until you have a silky smooth sauce
| Simmer for a few minutes, stirring all the while, until the sauce thickens a little.
| Meanwhile:
| Cook the pasta in lightly salted boiling water for about 6 minutes, or as directed on the packet
| Cook the cauliflower and broccoli pieces in boiling water for 6 to 7 minutes or to taste
| Drain the vegetables and pasta. Don't not rinse the pasta
| Mix pasta and vegetables together and serve, topped with the cheese sauce and a garnished with sliced tomatoes and a sprinkling of chopped chives and parsley
===Recipe source===

* Based on Mac and cheese: ''Modernist Cuisine'' ISBN 978-0982761007
===Variations===
Use any hard cheese of your choice

===Chef's notes===
For the quantities I used recipe scaling to calculate the portion sizes for 2 people from a 5 portion original. (scaling factor 0.4 [2/5]), however I think we could have done with a little more so have adjusted the ingredients on this recipe to a scaling factor of 0.6 [3/5].

Try variation of pasta and vegetables
