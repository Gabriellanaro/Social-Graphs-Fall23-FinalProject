You can fill this spicy calzone with just about anything. For this version, I have used a packet of sliced speciality cold meats, pepperoni, salami, prosciutto and Home smoked bacon.  Use what you have available but don't try to over-fill the pizzas!

===Ingredients===
| 1 portion pizza dough
| 1 portion spicy tomato pizza topping (use a jar of shop-bought pizza sauce if you're pushed for time)
| 150 g selection of quality sliced meats from the deli counter
| 250g provolone cheese, sliced
| 20 g (¼ cup) Parmesan cheese, freshly grated
| Basil leaves to garnish


===Mise en place===
* Preheat the oven to 230\u00b0 C (450\u00b0 F - gas 8) using a pizza stone if possible
===Method===


| Divide your pizza dough into two balls and roll out into two 20 cm (8\") rounds
| Spread one half of the base with the spicy tomato sauce
| Layer the provolone cheese and the sliced meats, sprinkling with Parmesan cheese
| Fold the pizza over so it creates a semi-circle and seal the edge by crimping rolling over, starting from one corner. A short how-to guide is here.
| Brush the seal and the surface with olive oil
| Cut 3 small slits in the top to allow steam to escape
| Dust the pizza stone with fine yellow cornmeal
| Bake for 10 minutes
| Remove and let the pizzas rest for 5 miutes
===Serving suggestions===
Serve with a salad.  If there is any tomato sauce left over after making the pizzas, warm it up and serve with the pizzas as a dip
===Variations===
Use mozzarella cheese if you can't get provolone cheese

I love en egg inside a calzone pizza, but often find that it often does not cook properly, so a neat cheat is to poach the egg in water beforehand.  I'm sure no self-respecting pizza chef would do that but it works for me!
