===Description===

As with any pizza, you can make it with almost any ingredients. Try and keep the quantities about the same though.  You can end up with a damp soggy pizza if you overdo the cheese.

===Ingredients===
| 1 portion pizza dough - makes 2 pizzas
| 1/2 portion spicy tomato pizza topping (use a jar of shop-bought pizza sauce if you're pushed for time)
| 150g Mozzarella cheese, torn into pieces
| 100g from a selection of good quality sliced meats from the deli counter
| 25g of Parmesan cheese, freshly grated
| Olive oil
| Basil leaves to garnish


===Mise en place===
* Make the pizza dough as instructed
* If using a pizza stone, preheat the pizza stone under a very hot grill for about 20 minutes.  Place it about 8cm (3\") from the heat source.

===Method===


| Make 1 pizza per person
| Preheat the oven to 230\u00b0 C (450\u00b0 F - gas 8) or about 9 cm (3\") from a very hot grill if using a pizza stone
| Dust the work surface with fine yellow cornmeal and divide your pizza dough into two balls and roll out into two 20 cm (8\") rounds
| Prick the pizza all over with a fork. This prevents it puffing up too much and burning while it is cooking.
| Pre-cook the pizza base for about 3 minutes on one side only if using a pizza stone, then remove from the oven, flip and add the topping
| Spread the spicy tomato sauce on the surface of the pizza
| Layer the sliced meats and Mozzarella cheese onto the pizza and sprinkle with Parmesan cheese
| Drizzle with olive oil
| Bake for about 9 to 10 minutes or until the base is crispy and the cheese has melted
===Serving suggestions===
Garnish with the basil leaves and serve with a salad.  If there is any tomato sauce left over after making the pizzas, warm it up and serve with the pizzas as a dip
