The ONLY slaw

I won't make any other cole slaw after making this. Rich and fattening, but fantastic!

===Description===

A rich creamy cole slaw based on New York's Manhattan Chili Co's own recipe:  Southwest-American Cookbook [ISBN 978-0517563175].

I've made this using half quantities, with great success.

===Ingredients===
| 236 ml (1 cup) mayonnaise
| 236 ml (1 cup) soured cream
| 2 teaspoons Colemans mustard
| 2 tablespoons mustard seeds
| Zest of 1 lime
| 3 teaspoons granulated sugar
| 1 white cabbage ( about 900g - 2 lb)
| 3 big carrots
| 2 cooking apples
| 1 large red onion, sliced
| A handful of currants or raisins - ''optional''

makes a LOT of coleslaw!

===Method===


| Whisk the mayo, sour cream, lime juice, zest and sugar and mustard.
| Clean, trim and core the cabbage
| Using a food processor with a slicing blade; chop the cabbage
| Wash, peel and trim the carrots and quarter lengthwise then chop with the processor
| Wash, peel, core and grate the apples
| Peel and slive the red onion
| Mix everything together using your hands in a non-metallic bowl.  Pick out and discard (or chop finely) any very large pieces that the food processor may have missed. Refrigerate overnight to allow the flavours to mingle
===Serving suggestions===
Serve with freshly grated black pepper
===Variations===
Use a red cabbage instead of a white cabbage for a lovely pink coleslaw.

For a really rich and luxurious slaw, use half the carrots, cabbage and apple but leave the quantities of the other ingredients as stated above.
===Chef's note===
If you make the recipe using the quantities above, you will need a bucket to mix them in and a big fridge to store it in afterwards - great for barbecue quantities though.

The Manhattan Chili Co. has now closed, see image above. ''Feb 2016''. The url was www.manhattanchili.com.
