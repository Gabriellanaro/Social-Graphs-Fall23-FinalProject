===Description===

[[Image:Pie for two.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Using the ingredients above, bake two separate 2 person pies on different days, each with half the filling and half a packet of pre-rolled pastry]]
A creamy, heartwarming meal that is made really easy by using pre-rolled puff pastry.

===Ingredients===
| 500 g (1 lb 2 oz) chicken breasts, skin removed
| 100g cooked ham
| 2 tablespoons plain flour
| 1 large leek, washed and sliced
| 1 large onion, peeled and sliced
| ¼ teaspoon grated nutmeg
| 2 tablespoons melted butter
| ¼ cup chicken stock
| ¼ cup single cream
| Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper


===Mise en place===
* Preheat the oven to 200\u00b0 C (400\u00b0 F - Gas 6 - Moderately hot)
** If your electric oven has the options of upper, lower, both elements, use the lower element.
===Method===


| Melt the butter in a small pan and use a little of it to grease a pie dish.
| Cube the chicken into 1.5 cm (1/2\") cubes and cut the ham into similar sized strips
| Season the flour with salt, pepper and nutmeg and roll the chicken in the seasoned flour so that it's well coated.
| Arrange the leeks and onions in the base of the pie dish.
| Cover with the chicken and ham pieces.
| Pour the remaining butter over the chicken pieces.
| Mix the stock and cream together and pour over the chicken.
| Roll out the pastry and cover the pie dish. Cut a few slashes in the crust to let air out while it's cooking
| Bake for 1 hour in the middle of the oven.
| Check after 20 minutes and if the crust looks as though it might be starting to burn, lay a sheet of tin foil over the top.
| Remove from the oven and allow to rest for 5 minutes before serving.
===Serving suggestions===

Serve hot with peas and squash mash.
