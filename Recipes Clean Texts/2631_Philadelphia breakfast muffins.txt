Now you don't need to visit that American fast-food hamburger chain for your breakfast. You can make these superior breakfast muffins yourself, at home!

Just the thing for an after-party breakfast - communal cooking at its best - we want your pictures!



===Ingredients===

| 4 rashers back bacon, rind removed
| 4 english muffins or bread rolls, cut in half horizontally
| 100 g Philadelphia Original
| 2 medium tomatoes, sliced
| 4 large eggs
===Method===


| Heat the grill and cook the bacon until golden and crisp, keep warm. Fill a medium-large pan \u00be\u0092s full with water. Bring to the boil and then reduce to a simmer.
| Toast the muffins on both sides (If using rolls and they are fresh, you may prefer not to toast them) under a preheated grill and grill the tomato slices at the same time to warm through.
| Spread one half of the muffins or rolls with Philly and top the other halves with tomato slices.
| Poach the eggs in the simmering water for 2-3 minutes or until just cooked. Place two muffin or roll halves onto each plate, serving the poached eggs on the Philly half. Lay the bacon over the top and serve.
