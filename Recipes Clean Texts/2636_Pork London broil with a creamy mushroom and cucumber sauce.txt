===Description===

I've added this odd sounding recipe as an aide-memoir for myself, so it can be easily repeated.  It sounds very strange but the combination worked brilliantly.  The sauce is based on mushrooms in a cucumber sauce, with added double cream.  The London broil marinade was just a rather successful experiment. Although London broil is usually associated with beef, this worked really well with a pork fillet - even better because it was barbecued, creating a smoky, crisp finish, but remaining tender inside.

'''Mushroom and cucumber sauce'''
===Ingredients===
| A good grind of black pepper
| 50g [2 oz] butter
| 110 g [4 oz] of oyster mushrooms, wiped clean and chopped
| 1 tablespoon [15 ml] plain flour
| Half a cucumber, de-seeded, peeled and cubed
| 150 ml [1/4 pint] hot vegetable stock
| 1 teaspoon dried dill
| sea salt to taste
| 150 ml double cream
'''London broil pork fillet'''
===Ingredients===NB
| 300g Pork tenderloin fillet, sliced into 2 pieces lengthways
| 4 tablespoons of orange juice
| 2 tablespoons of dark soy sauce
| 2 tablespoons of light soy sauce
| 2 tablespoons of Worcestershire sauce
| 2 tablespoons of sherry vinegar
| Pinch of black pepper
| Pinch of chilli powder

===Mise en place===
Add the pork fillet and the marinade ingredients to a Lock and Lock box, close the lid and shake well to coat evenly. Refrigerate for up to 12 hours, turning and shaking now and then if you are able.
===Method===

| Add a good grind of black pepper to a small saucepan and melt the butter
| Saut\u00e9 the mushrooms in the butter for 4 minutes, turning often
| Add the cubed cucumber cubes and cook until they visibly 'wilt', about 5 minutes, stirring now and then
| Make a roux by sprinkling  the flour over the buttery cucumber and mushrooms and mix well so all the fat is absorbed
| Add the dried dill and hot stock and blend into a sauce
| Bring to the boil and then reduce and simmer for 10 minutes
| Stir in the double cream and heat gently - don't allow it to boil or the cream will 'split'
'''London broil pork fillet'''

| Drain the pork fillets and discard the marinade
| Barbecue or grill over a fairly high heat for about 5 minutes per side
| Check the meat is properly cooked
| Serve

===Serving suggestion===
We had this with rice, it might be nice to add a few peas or beans to the rice, just for a little colour.
