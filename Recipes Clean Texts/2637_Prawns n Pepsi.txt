===Description===

The idea for this recipe came from the delightful cookbook '''''Two cooks and a suitcase''''' by Doug Bell & Rhoda Robertson, who also run the Scottish Mexican deli chain: '''Lupe Pintos Deli''' and the companion website: [http://www.lupepintos.com/ http://www.lupepintos.com/]. Both are a must for all things Mexican and much more.  The book is available from their website.

This dish is very similar in taste to the Indian dish, Garlic chilli prawns, I trust you will enjoy it

| '''The prawns'''

===Serving suggestions===

Serve hot with plain boiled rice and peas and peppers
===Variations===

If you can afford it, try chunks of monkfish or even lobster.

===Any left overs?===

Yes? - then make Prawn 'n' Pepsi flan! 

===Chef's tip===

If you are using dried chillies, soak them for 30 minutes in boiled water before removing the stalks and chopping.  If you are uncertain as to how hot this dish will be for you, don't add the seeds, reserve them, taste the sauce after 15 minutes and add them if you need more heat. Wear rubber gloves when handling chillies.
