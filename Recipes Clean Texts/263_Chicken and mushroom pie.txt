| 150 g (5.5 oz) button mushrooms, quartered 
| 2 tablespoons plain flour
| 1 large leek, washed and sliced
| 1 clove garlic, peeled ad crushed
| 1 large onion, peeled and sliced
| ¼ teaspoon grated nutmeg
| 2 tablespoons melted butter
| ¼ cup chicken stock
| ¼ cup single cream
| Handful of freshly chopped parsley
| Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper


===Mise en place===
* Preheat the oven to 200\u00b0 C (400\u00b0 F - Gas 6 - Moderately hot)
** If your electric oven has the options of upper, lower, both elements, use the lower element.

===Method===


| Melt the butter in a small pan and stir-fry the garlic for a minutes or so. Use little of it to grease a pie dish.
| Cube the chicken 1.5 cm (1/2\") cubes
| Season the flour with salt, pepper and nutmeg and roll the chicken in the seasoned flour so that it's well coated.
| Arrange the leeks and onions in the base of the pie dish.
| Cover with the chicken and mushrooms.
| Pour the remaining butter and garlic over the chicken pieces.
| Mix the stock and cream together and pour over the chicken.
| Roll out the pastry and cover the pie dish, cut a few slashes in the crust to let air out while it's cooking
| Bake for 1 hour in the middle of the oven.
| Check after 20 minutes and if the crust looks as though it might be starting to burn, lay a sheet of tin foil over the top.
| Remove from the oven and allow to rest for 5 minutes before serving.
