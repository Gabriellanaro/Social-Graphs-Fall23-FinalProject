===Description===

A Screwdriver (sometimes known as an ''Orange-Vod-Juice-Ka'') is a popular highball drink made with fresh orange juice and vodka. On rare occasion, it is referred to as \"Vodka and Orange\". While the basic drink is simply the two ingredients, there are many variations, many of these with multiple names, that can be found all over the world.

The earliest written reference to the Screwdriver is from the October 24, 1949 issue of Time:
\"In the dimly lighted bar of the sleek Park Hotel, Turkish intelligence agents mingle with American engineers and Balkan refugees, drinking the latest Yankee concoction of vodka and orange juice, called a 'screwdriver'.\"

The drink reportedly got its name because American petroleum engineers in Saudi Arabia secretly added vodka to small cans of orange juice and stirred the mixture with their screwdrivers.

===Ingredients===
| 1.5 oz Vodka
| 6 oz fresh orange juice


===Method===


| Add the vodka to an ice filled highball glass
| Top up with orange juice
