Chilli on the go.  I feel like a movie star eating this.

===Description===

A Sloppy Joe is an American dish of ground beef, onions, sweetened tomato sauce or ketchup and other seasonings, served on a hamburger bun. Contradictory lore suggests that the Original Sloppy Joe Sandwich was invented at Sloppy Joe's Bar in Key West, Florida, or by a cook named Joe at a cafe in Sioux City, Iowa, as a variation of the popular \"loose meat\" sandwich (which does not contain tomato sauce).

There are numerous variations of this recipe, this is my favourite.  I add lots more chilli so it becomes chilli con carne in a roll.
===Other names===
Sloppy joes can also referred to as:
* ''Yip Yips'' in Southern Illinois near St Louis. 
* ''Yum Yums'' in parts of the Midwest USA, particularly in Nebraska
* ''Wimpies'' in parts of the Northeast USA, especially Northeastern Pennsylvania
* ''Slushburgers'' in parts of the Upper Midwest, particularly in Eastern Montana and Western North Dakota
* ''Barbecues'' in other areas of the Upper Midwest, and also in some parts of Southeastern Pennsylvania.
* ''Taverns'' in parts of northwest Iowa and Minnesota.
* ''Sloppy Janes'' in parts of central Minnesota.
* '' Steamers'' in parts of Virginia, West Virginia, and Maryland.
* ''Gulash'' (not to be confused with Goulash) in parts of the Upper Midwest.
* ''Dynamites'' in northern Rhode Island.
* ''Manwich'' in parts of Northern New Jersey, after the popular name brand sauce, as a distinction from the local variant also known as a \"sloppy joe\"
