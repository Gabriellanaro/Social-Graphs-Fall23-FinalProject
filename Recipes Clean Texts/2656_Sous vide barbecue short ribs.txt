 The Judge 
===Description===

Yet another experiment at sous vide cooking using my homemade sous vide conversion kit.  Short ribs are probably much better suited to slow cooking (''Beef short ribs (slow cooker recipe)'') than sous vide cooking as they need prolonged cooking to break down the fats and collagen to make them palatable.  10 hours in the slow cooker is just about right from the experiments I've done.  Anyway, to my thinking, the benefits of sous vide cooking in a sealed pouch would be in  concentrating the marinade flavours.

In the end the results were very good, but no better than slow cooking the short ribs.

I cooked the short ribs in the marinade for 24 hours at 75\u00b0C(''167\u00b0F'')

===Ingredients===

| 800g rack of halved beef short ribs containing 2 ribs
'''marinade'''
===Ingredients===NB
| 1 teaspoon chilli powder
| 1 teaspoon sea salt
| 1 teaspoon ground black pepper
| 2 tablespoons tomato puree
| 1 teaspoon dried parsley
| 1 tablespoon Heinz tomato sauce
| 1 teaspoon mustard powder
| 1 square of Bournville chocolate
| 2 tablespoons of muscovado sugar
| 50 ml ruby port

===Method===


| Mix the marinade ingredients together (I microwaved them for a minute just to melt the chocolate and enable it to mix well)
| Place the marinade and the short ribs in an oversized vacuum pouch.  This helps prevent the marinade being sucked into the sealer.
| Cook sous vide at  75\u00b0 (''167\u00b0F'') C for 24 hours.
===Serving suggestions===
This went well served with peas, carrots, some extravagant looking pasta and some of the sauce poured over.
===Chef's notes===
As short ribs release an awful amount of fat, it might be an idea, if you have the time, to allow them to cool, skim the solidified fat and reheat to serve.
