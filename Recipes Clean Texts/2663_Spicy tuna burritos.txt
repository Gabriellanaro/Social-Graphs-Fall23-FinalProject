===Description===

A great filling for a burrito. Juicy tuna flakes mixed with tomatoes and rice.  Other fish varieties would work fine including red snapper, cod, bass, bream and pollack

===Ingredients===
| 175 g (6 oz) tuna steaks per person
| 90 g (3.5 oz) basmati rice
| 1 small onion
| 1 teaspoon ground achiote seed (annatto powder)
| A few small dried chillies, ground to a powder
| 75 g (3 oz) flaked almonds
| 1 400g tin chopped tomatoes
| 85 g (3Â½ oz) Cheddar cheese, grated
| 6 large wheat flour tortillas
| 2 tablespoons olive oil
===Method===


| Preheat the grill
| In a small frying pan, toast the almonds until browned. Careful not to burn them!  Set aside
| Cook the tuna for 4 minutes per side on an oiled grill tray.  When cooked, flake into a bowl and set aside
| Rinse the rice well under cold running water
| In a large pan, cover the rice with boiling water, return to the boil and simmer for about 8 minutes.  Drain and set aside
| Heat the oil in a large pan and cook the onion until soft and translucent
| Add the achiote powder and chili powder and cook for a few minutes
| Add the rice and stir fry for a minute
| Add the tomatoes, stir well and then cover and simmer until most of the juice has been absorbed into the rice (about 15 minutes)
| Warm the tortillas under a grill for a few minutes (or seconds in a microwave)
| Stir in the cheese and serve
===Serving suggestions===

You can roll the burritos in the kitchen so they are ready to serve or bring the mixture to the table in a bowl and let everyone make their own.

Serve with wedges of lime and a green salad

===Variations===

Make the burritos and heat under a grill for a few minutes for an interesting change.

If you can't get annatto powder, try other spices such as cumin and paprika.
