===Description===

Try this pork recipe for Mexican-style fried pork, using the best cut of pork and your favourite chillies.

===Ingredients===
| 1 pork fillet cut into 4 steaks or 4 pork escallops, flattened as shown here (don't cut them into strips though)
| 1 tablespoon cider vinegar
| 2 of your favourite chillies, rehydrated if dried and deseeded (to taste)
| 2 cloves of garlic, peeled and crushed
| Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
| Juice of 1 lemon
| Dash of olive oil for the marinade
| Olive oil for fryng (It's not authentic, but I feel so much healthier when frying with olive oil!)
| 1 large egg, beaten

'''Seasoned flour'''
* Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
* 75 g (3 oz ) masa harina or yellow cornmeal
* 75 g (3 oz ) plain flour
* 2 tablespoons of Taco mix

===Method===


| Mix together, the vinegar, garlic, chillies, salt and pepper, lemon juice and a splash of olive oil and mix to a thin marinade.
| Coat the pork steaks with the marinade, refrigerate and allow to infuse for at least 2 hours.
| Add the two flours, the taco mix to a shallow dish and mix well to combine
|# You can omit the taco mix but it would be a shame as it gives the coating a homemade 'Kentucky-fried' flavour.
| Dip both sides of the steaks into the seasoned flour
| Knock off any excess flour and dip into the beaten egg, then back into the seasoned flour.
| Again, knock off any excess flour.
| Fry in a little olive oil until the pork is properly cooked and golden brown on both sides.
| Pat any excess oil off on a kitchen towel.

===Chef's note===

If you can't get Masa harina then use yellow cornmeal instead.
