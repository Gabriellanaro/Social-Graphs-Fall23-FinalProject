I especially love the breadcrumb topping.

 

 The Judge 
===Description===

Julia from I believe I can fry, puts this far better than I could:

\"Tuna noodle casserole is considered a classic by many; it's quick to prepare, super cheap, and easy enough to throw together at any time. For me, it's a recipe that I can make at any time, since I almost ALWAYS have all of the ingredients already in the house.\"

It's not a recipe that is known to me, maybe that's because I'm not American?  Sound jolly nice though!

===Ingredients===

| 6oz wide or extra wide egg noodles
| 1 5oz can tuna packed in water, drained and flaked with a fork
| 1 can condensed cream of mushroom soup
| ½ cup milk
| 1 cup frozen peas, cooked
| ¾ cup shredded sharp cheddar cheese
| ½ cup dried bread crumbs
| 1 tablespoon melted butter
| ¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese
===Mise en place===

* Preheat the oven to 180\u00b0 C (350\u00b0 F - gas 4), [fan oven 160\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]

===Method===


| Cook the egg noodles according to package directions. Drain and transfer to a large mixing bowl.
| Cook the frozen peas: simply microwave them in a bowl with a few tablespoons of water for 2-3 minutes, covered with cling-film.
| Add the peas, tuna, cream of mushroom soup, milk, & shredded cheese. Stir until well combined.
| Transfer to a greased 9x9\" baking dish. Toss the bread crumbs with the melted butter. Sprinkle evenly atop the casserole. Top with grated Parmesan.
| Bake in a 350-degree oven for 30 minutes. Let rest about 5 minutes before serving.
