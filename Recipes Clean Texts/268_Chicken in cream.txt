===Description===

A nice simple dish which is great to use up left-over double cream.  It's the sort of dish you could add lots of various ingredients to suit your taste.

Chopped mushrooms, cooked broad beans, green beans or cauliflower would also be good.

| 3 cloves of garlic, peeled and crushed
| 150 ml double cream
|150 ml Greek yogurt
| 2 tablespoons dry sherry
| 6 dried apricots, chopped 
| Freshly chopped parsley and walnut pieces to garnish
===Mise en place===

* Preheat your oven to 180\u00b0 C (350\u00b0 F - gas 4), [fan oven 160\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]

===Method===


| Heat the oil, with a pinch of black pepper in an oven-proof casserole dish  pan over a medium heat
| Stir-fry the onions for 3 or 4 minutes
