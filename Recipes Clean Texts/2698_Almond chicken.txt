Another nice way to cook chicken breasts.  White wine with with white meat.

===Ingredients===
| 4 chicken breasts, bones and skin removed
| 40 g (1 ½ oz) butter
| Juice from ½ a lemon
| Chopped zest from ¼ of a lemon
| 40 g (1 ½ oz) almond flakes or halves, chopped and toasted, browned but NOT burnt
| 1 garlic clove, crushed
| 1 onion, sliced finely
| 1 bell pepper (or a coloured mix of bell peppers), chopped
| 2 tablespoons parsley
| 50 ml (2 fl oz) dry white wine
| 2 teaspoons cornflour mixed to a paste with a little cold water
| Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
===Method===


| Melt half of the butter in a pan and gently brown the chicken pieces on both sides
| Add the lemon juice, season with salt and pepper and return to a gentle heat and cook for 20 minutes
| Remove the chicken and keep warm
| Add the remaining butter, onions, garlic and brown the onions being careful not to burn them
| Add the half of the toasted almonds, cornflour, wine and return the chicken and turn the heat up to reduce the liquid so there is just a little sauce
| Garnish with the remaining almond slices
| Pour into a warm serving dish

===Variations===

Try 2 tablespoons of chopped chervil instead of the parsley if you are growing it or can buy it.
