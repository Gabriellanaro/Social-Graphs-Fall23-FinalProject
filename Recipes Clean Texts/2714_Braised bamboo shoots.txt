I made this with canned bamboo shoots and was not impressed.  Sorry

Another simple, quick and inspiring recipe from Robin. Do take the time to view her blog and Flickr pages. If you are a true 'foodie' you will not be disappointed.
Robin mentions that she has been unable to find fresh baby bamboo shoots, though I guess if you have bamboo growing in the garden, you can probably harvest that. Our bamboo grows at quite a rate and it's only a miniature type. Use the comments page to let us know what you think.

===Ingredients===
| 280 g Baby bamboo shoots, cut in pieces
| 1 tablespoon peanut oil
| 1 tablespoon oyster sauce
