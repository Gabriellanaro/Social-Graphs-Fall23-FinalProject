===Description===

One of the great things about owning a Thermomix is its ability to make stock concentrates which can be kept in the fridge in a jar or plastic container.  It works out so much cheaper than commercial stock cubes and contains no nasty chemicals.

===Ingredients===TM

| 375g raw chicken, roughly chopped
| 430g vegetables (I used 2 celery stalks, \u00bd large carrot, 1 medium onion, 1 bulb garlic and \u00bd small courgette) chopped into large pieces
| 2-3 teaspoons dried herbes de provence
| 200g coarse sea salt
| 65g white wine

===Method===



| Put the chicken in the bowl '''Speed 5-7-9 / 10 seconds'''
| Add the vegetables '''Speed 6 / 10-15 seconds'''
| Add the dried herbs, salt and wine '''Speed 2 / Temp. Varoma / 20 minutes''' using internal steaming basket on the top, rather than the MC.
| When the cooking time is over and the mixture has cooled somewhat, replace the MC '''Speed 10 / 1 minute'''.
===Serving suggestions===
Use 1 teaspoon of the concentrate to 500ml of water.
===Chef's notes===
It will taste very salty in its concentrated form, but once diluted in water it will be fine.
