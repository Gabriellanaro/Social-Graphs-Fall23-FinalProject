[[Image:Noodles with minced pork recipe.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Using fine egg noodles instead of cellophane noodles]]
Cellophane noodles with minced pork (Ants climbing a tree, Bean thread noodles with minced pork is a classic Szechuan (Sichuan) dish that uses the transparent (mung) bean thread or cellophane noodles combined with finely minced pork in a spicy sauce that is said to resemble ants climbing a tree.

===Ingredients===
| 125 g (4 oz) dried cellophane noodles
| 225g (8 oz) finely minced pork tenderloin
|* Turn pork fillet into mince in a seconds using a food processor with a metal blade
'''for the meat'''
* 1 tablespoon dark soy sauce
* 2 teaspoons rice wine or dry sherry
* 2 teaspoons sesame oil
* 1 tablespoon peanut oil
'''simmering mix'''
* 1 tablespoon finely grated ginger root
* 2 tablespoons Garlic, peeled and crushed
* 4 tablespoons finely chopped spring onions
* 2 tablespoons dark soy sauce
* 1 tablespoon chilli bean sauce
** See chef's note below
* 2 teaspoons sugar
* 450 ml (16 fl oz) chicken stock
'''garnish'''
* Finely chopped spring onions
* Finely chopped green chillies (optional)

===Mise en place===
* Soak the noodles in warm water for 15 minutes, rinse and drain discarding the water
===Method===


| Combine the soy, rice wine and sesame oil with the meat and mix well
| Heat the peanut oil until smoking and stir fry the pork mixture for 2 minutes
| Add the spring onions, ginger and garlic and stir-fry for a further 2 minutes
| Add the 'simmering mix' and the noodles to the wok, bring to the boil and simmer vigorously until almost most of the liquid has evaporated
===Serving suggestions===
Serve, garnished with finely chopped spring onions and optional finely chopped green chillies
===Variations===
You could make this with fine egg vermicelli, if like me, you are not over-keen on cellophane noodles.
===Chef's note===
Using chilli bean sauce (which in itself is very salty) makes this, extremely delicious dish, a little too salty. I would be inclined to add chilli mash or plenty of fresh chillies instead of the chilli bean sauce.
