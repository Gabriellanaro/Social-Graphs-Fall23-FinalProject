This is better than any takeaway as it does not have that gloopy texture that most takeaway Chinese foods tends to have.

===Serving suggestions===

Serve hot with plain rice, brown rice or noodles

==Notes==
The version I did for these photos don't quite match the recipe that I normally make but I thought best to leave the recipe as is, and make my excuses here.

When shopping, the red peppers looked better than the green so I switched colours.  I couldn't get bottled or canned Chinese fermented black beans in the supermarket, but I did find the Amoy mix as in the photo. I used slightly more than half the packet without any soaking.
