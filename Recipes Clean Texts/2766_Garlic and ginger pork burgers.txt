Ginger lifts this burger, as does the garlic.

===Serving suggestions===
Serve with satay sauce.
===Chef's notes===
Use chili sauce if you don't have fresh chillies.

Freeze the uncooked burgers, separated with greaseproof paper for easy thawing.

I added a little sherry and a splash of olive oil as well, just for the hell of it.

With in the proportions above, you should not need a beaten egg to hold the burgers together, however, if you increase the quantity of breadcrumbs over 40g , then add a beaten egg at step one.
