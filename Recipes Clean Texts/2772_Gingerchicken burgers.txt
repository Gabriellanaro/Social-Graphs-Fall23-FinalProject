These barbecue chicken burgers are really tasty and quick to make.  Serve in decent bread rolls with a little green salad and satay sauce.

===Ingredients===
| 500g (1/2 lb) of boneless chicken (breast, thighs etc)
| 2 tablespoons freshly grated ginger
| 2 cloves garlic, peeled and crushed
| 4 spring onions, finely chopped
| 1 fresh red chilli, finely chopped
| 1 tablespoon dark soy sauce
| 40 g breadcrumbs
===Method===


| Place the chicken pieces in a food processor with a metal blade and pulse until you have a rough mince. Don't over-do it or you'll end up with baby-food.
| Add the remaining ingredients and give it a quick pulse.
| Tip out onto a cutting board and make the final mix with your hands.
| Shape into 8 burgers.
| Place on an oiled barbecue grill, hotplate, griddle, or even a frying pan.
| Cook for about 8 minutes, turning every two minutes.
| Check they are properly cooked.
| Rest for 4 minutes.
===Serving suggestions===
Serve with satay sauce.
===Chef's notes===
Use chili sauce if you don't have fresh chillies.

Freeze the uncooked burgers, separated with greaseproof paper for easy thawing.

With in the proportions above, you should not need a beaten egg to hold the burgers together, however, if you increase the quantity of breadcrumbs over 40g , then add a beaten egg at step one.
