A stunning array of flavours; and pasta!

 The Judge 
===Description===

I had a sample of Taste Sensation's Taste Sensation chilli coconut marinade and it tasted so great, I thought I would find an excuse to make a nice healthy salad.

I've cooked the chicken breast sous-vide as I find it the best way to keep the chicken moist.  If you don't have a sous-vide bath, I would use pre-cooked chicken left-overs or even supermarket pre-sliced chicken. Add them to a Lock and Lock box together with the marinade powder and shake the box well to coat the chicken evenly.

===Chef's notes===
This recipe is probably quite difficult to replicate without a sous-vide cooker but you could probably marinade and steam the chicken in a small dish to keep the cooking juices.
