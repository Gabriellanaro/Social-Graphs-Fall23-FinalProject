This is so much better than the take-away version.  You can eat a whole duck for next to nothing this way. :D

Making this delicious Chinese take-away favourite at home is so simple and so reasonably priced that you'll never buy it from the take-away again.

Unless you want to spend money for the sake of it, don't buy the ingredients from your local 'big-name' supermarket.  You'll probably pay double and certainly won't have the selection of ingredients that you'll have if you follow my next suggestion.
===Buy the ingredients from the same place as your Chinese take-away does===
''This advice is specific to the United Kingdom, though I'm sure similar outlets exist throughout the world''.

Pay a visit to your local Chinese food wholesaler.  There are chains of them throughout the UK and you don't need to be a member of any trade association to buy from them.  You may find them a little intimidating at first, but the staff are friendly and if you are into your food in a big way, you will find it a fascinating experience.  Most of them have a very good online presence so you can 'look before you buy'.  I guarantee that you will go back again and again.

===Ingredients===
| 800g frozen pre cooked aromatic crispy duck [\u00a39.50]
| 1 multi-pack 'pancakes for crispy duck' [ 102 pancakes, 17 packs (pre-packed in packs of 6) ]
| 1 cucumber
| 1 bunch spring onions
| 50g 'Sauce for Peking Duck'


===Mise en place===
* Defrost a few packets of Chinese pancakes
* Peel the cucumber, quarter lengthwise and run a sharp knife along each quadrant to remove most of the seeds.
* Top and tail the spring onions
* Using a food processor with a metal blade, slice the cucumber and spring onions.  It doesn't look as neat as julienning them, but it takes a quarter of the time and tastes just as good.
* Chill the spring onions and cucumber in the refrigerator while the duck defrosts
* Preheat the oven to 200\u00b0 C (400\u00b0 F - gas 6)

===Method===


| Place the duck (skin-side down) on a rack over a roasting tray or a perforated roasting tray over a roasting tray - this will allow for the fat to drain off whilst the duck cooks.
| Roast the duck for 45 minutes, turning once, carefully draining the roasting tray if it fills with fat, otherwise you'll have a very smoky kitchen
| You can steam the pancakes in a Chinese steamer over a wok or pan of boiling water for a few minutes - they only need to be warmed, not cooked.  I find they often stick together warming them this way so I prefer to separate the pancakes, spread them out on a large plate and microwave them for a minute or two to warm them.
| Remove the duck from the oven, chop the skin into bite-sized pieces and then with two forks pulling against each other, shred the duck meat.
===To serve===
Spread a little of your favourite sauce on a pancake, cover with cucumber, spring onions & duck, roll the pancake up and eat with your fingers - delicious!
===Variations===
Try other sauces: Hoisin sauce, Plum sauce, chilli sauce and even mayonaise works very well!

Sliced white onions are a nice addition to spring onions.
