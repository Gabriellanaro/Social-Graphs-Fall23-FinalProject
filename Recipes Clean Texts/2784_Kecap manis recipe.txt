Kecap manis is a flavoured sweet soy sauce, which has a thick, almost syrupy consistency and a pronounced sweet, treacle-like flavour due to generous addition of palm sugar or molasses.

This recipe and photograph, has reproduced by kind permission of Robin

===Ingredients===
| 100 ml light soy sauce (or Kikoman)
| 75 ml molasses
| 2 slices ginger
| 1 small clove garlic, crushed
| Â½ red chilli (fresh or dried)
| 1 star anise
===Method===


| Bring to the boil, simmer for about 10 minutes until syrupy consistence.
| When you use blackstrap molasses you probably need to add palm sugar too because the resulting sauce should be quite sweet.
