===Description===

We often make this in our Motorhome, it's a nice and simple recipe to make and is great food to pick at.  Ideal for parties.

Although I planned to use chilli dogs, as Anne wanted normal hot dogs, we used those and I added the chilli sauce afterwards.

This is the kind of recipe you can throw in what you fancy - just make sure it's not too wet or you'll get soggy tortilla chips.
===Ingredients===

| 1 large pack lightly salted tortilla chips
| 1 560g can of hot dogs (large)
| Splash of olive oil
| Pinch of freshly ground black pepper
| 2 small white onions, peeled an finely chopped
| 4 fresh tomatoes
| 180g mature Cheddar cheese
| Pinch of mixed herbs
| Chilli sauce to serve
===Mise en place===

* Preheat your oven to 180\u00b0 C (350\u00b0 F - gas 4), [fan oven 160\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]

===Method===


| Add a splash of olive oil to a large baking tray
| Sprinkle with black pepper
| Finely chop the onions and arrange half in the base of the tray
| Chop half of the hot dogs into small pieces and scatter over the onions
| Roughly chop half of the tomatoes and add to the onions & hot dogs
| Tip the tortilla chip into the tray and top with the remaining chopped hot dogs, onions and tomatoes
| Sprinkle with a good pinch of mixed herbs (and chilli sauce if using)
| Cover with grated Cheddar cheese
| Bake in the oven for about 20 minutes until the cheese is bubbling and the dogs are cooked.
===Variations===
Use canned chilli dogs instead of frankfurters
