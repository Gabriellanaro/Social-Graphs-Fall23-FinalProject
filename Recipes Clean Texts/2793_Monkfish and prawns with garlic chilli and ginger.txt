===Description===

My husband adores monkfish and this is my variation of Cockles with garlic, chili and ginger which Robin very kindly gave Cookipedia permission to reproduce recently.

===Ingredients===
| 2-3 tbsps groundnut oil
| 530g fresh monkfish fillets, any bone removed and fish cut into chunks.
| 2 handfuls of peeled, cooked prawns
| 2 tbsps sesame oil

| 1 medium onion, peeled and chopped
| 2 cm ginger root, peeled and finely chopped
| 1-2 bulbs of garlic, peeled and thinly sliced
| 1 teaspoon sugar
| 1 tablespoon coconut flour mixed into a paste with 3 tbsps hot water
'''Garnish'''
* 4 spring onions, chopped on the diagonal
* Dash of soy sauce

===Method===
