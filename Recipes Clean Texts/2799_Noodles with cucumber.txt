Nice as a tapa too

Even though this is CHinese, it worked well as a Spanish tapa.

This unusual cold Chinese noodle recipe, that is based on a recipe from Ken Hom's 'Taste of China, will help you use up a glut of cucumbers and also be another contender for your [http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2009/may/14/ghent-vegetarian-city-healthy-belgium Gent night] recipes.

===Ingredients===
| 450 g (1 lb) fresh or dried Chinese egg noodles
| 1 tablespoon sesame oil
| 450 g (1lb) cucumber (one cucumber)
| 175 g (6 oz) fresh bean sprouts
'''Dressing'''
* 1 tablespoon Garlic, peeled and crushed
* 1 tablespoon ginger root, peeled and very finely chopped or grated
* 2 teaspoons light soy sauce
* 1 tablespoon dark soy sauce
* 1 tablespoon sugar ( I prefer brown sugar)
* 2.5 tablespoons sesame paste (tahini)
* 1 tablespoon white wine vinegar
* 2 teaspoons chilli oil
'''To serve'''
* 1 teaspoon granulated sugar
* 3 tablespoons sesame seeds, lightly toasted

===Method===


| Cook the noodles as instructed, refresh under cold water, rinse and drain then toss in the sesame oil
| Peel the cucumbers, cut into 4 length-ways and run your knife down the 'triangle' to remove and discard the seeds.
| Cut into thin slices (food processor is your friend here)
| Blanche the bean sprouts in boiling water for 1 minute then rinse and drain in cold water
| Mix the dressing ingredients well, add the noodles and cucumbers and toss in the dressing
| Sprinkle with sugar and sesame seeds and serve immediately
===Chef's note===
If using Very lazy ginger or the homemade version of the same thing, use the vinegar from that instead of white wine vinegar.
