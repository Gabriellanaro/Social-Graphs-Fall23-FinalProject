===Description===

If you grow your own cucumbers you'll know that you tend to get a glut of them when they are in season and are probably always seeking new cucumber recipe ideas, this one is a unique and exotic way of using up another cucumber.

===Ingredients===
| 4 cm (1.5\" fresh root ginger, peeled and chopped)
| 2 garlic cloves, peeled and chopped
| 2 Indian green chillies, de-seeded
| 3 tablespoons jaggery or brown sugar
| 3 tablespoons fish sauce (nuoc mam or nam pla)
| Juice from 1 lime or 2-3 tablespoons lime juice
| 4 tablespoons of water
| 1 small cucumber
| 2 teaspoons sesame oil
| 4 Salmon steaks
===Method===


| Using a pestle and mortar, food processor or mini-chopper, grind the sugar, garlic, ginger and chillies to a pulp.
| Mix in the fish sauce, water and lime juice
| Add the dressing to the fish and marinade for an hour or so.
| Cut the cucumber into quarters lengthwise and run a knife down each quadrant to remove the seeds
| Using a speed-peeler or mandoline cut the cucumber into long thin strips.
| Remove the fish from the marinade and replace with the cucumber strips and marinade for no more than 10 minutes or they start to loose their crunch.
| Rub the sesame oil on the grill pan and pan sear the salmon steaks for a few minutes on each side.
| Remove from the heat and rest, covered for 5 minutes.
===Serving suggestions===
Garnish with the cucumber strips, pour over the dressing and serve. 
===Variations===
chopped spring onions go nicely with this.
