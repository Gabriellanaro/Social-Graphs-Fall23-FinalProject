===Description===

These are the best post-pub snack in the universe. They're so easy and good.  They're also good with roast chicken, roast sweet potatoes and sweetcorn.

If you're not a chili fan, try this with sweet banana peppers instead.

===Ingredients===

| 4 to 6 decent sized chilli peppers
| 200g cream cheese
| 1 teaspoon freshly chopped coriander leaves
| 8 to 12 rashers of smoked streaky bacon
===Mise en place===

* Heat the oven to 200\u00b0 C (400\u00b0 F - gas 6), [fan oven 180\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]

===Method===


| Halve the peppers lengthwise.  Cut through the stem and try to keep it intact
| Scoop out the seeds and membrane and discard them
| Fold the coriander leaves into the cheese
| Wrap the bacon around the chilli a couple of times.  Secure with a cocktail stick
| Place on a baking tray and roast until the bacon is properly cooked
===Variations===
Try this with goats cheese or mascarpone cheese
