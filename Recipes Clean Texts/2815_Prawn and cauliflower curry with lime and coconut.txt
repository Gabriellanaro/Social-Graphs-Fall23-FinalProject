The basil makes all the difference.  If you can get Thai basil, even better.

[[Image:Prawn & cauliflower curry ingredients.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The ingredients]]

===Ingredients===
| 450 g (1 lb) raw tiger prawns, scampi, king prawns etc.
| Zest and juice of 1 lime.
| 1 tablespoon vegetable oil.
| 1 onion, peeled and chopped.
| 4 garlic cloves, peeled and roughly chopped.
| 4 dried birds' eye chillies, ground to powder in a coffee grinder or crushed in a mortar and pestle (or to taste).
| 1 cauliflower, broken into florets.
| 1 teaspoon jaggery or brown sugar.
| 1 teaspoon coriander seeds, ground to a powder in a coffee grinder.
| 2 teaspoons fenugreek seeds, ground to powder in a coffee grinder.
| 2 whole star anise, dry-fried and ground to a powder in a coffee grinder.
| 1 can (450ml) coconut milk.
| A splash of nam pla
| A handful of coriander leaves or basil leaves, stalks removed, for garnish.
| sea salt and freshly ground black pepper.


===Mise en place===
* Remove the shells from the prawns and de-vein them. 
* Place in a bowl with the lime zest and juice and leave in a cool place for an hour or so if you have time.
===Method===


| Add the oil to a hot wok and stir-fry the onions for 5 minutes, add the garlic and chillies and as soon as the garlic starts to colour.
| Add the cauliflower.
| Add the cauliflower and Stir-fry for 4 minutes, don't allow the garlic to burn.
| Add the sugar and spices, once combined, add the coconut milk and the nam pla.
| Reduce to a low simmer and heat for 10 to 15 minutes.
| Simmer for a little longer if you feel it needs further reduction.
| Add the bowl of prawns, together with the lime juice and cook until the prawns turn pink, this should only take 3 minutes or so.
| Season to taste with salt and pepper and serve, sprinkled with coriander.
===Serving suggestions===
Serve hot with noodles, rice, or crusty bread.
===Variations===
Instead of cauliflower, try broccoli, cubes of butternut squash or even potatoes, though they will need par-boiling first.
===Chef's note===
If you prefer your cauliflower softer, then par boil it for 3 minutes before stir-frying.
'''This was a fantastic curry!'''  I made with one whole star anise (not one 'petal'), but I think it would be better with 2.  I used 6 dried birds' eye chillies and 2 large dried chile de Arbole.  I had run out of limes so I used bottled lemon juice and a handful of crushed lemon leaves from our ornamental tree in the marinade and the cooking.
