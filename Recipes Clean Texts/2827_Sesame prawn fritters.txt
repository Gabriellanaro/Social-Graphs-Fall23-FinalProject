A nice change and healthy, not being deep fried.

===Description===

I tried to attempt a healthier variation of the deep fried the prawn ball recipe in the form of a fritter. It works pretty well I feel.
[[Image:RecipeSesame prawn fritters.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Sesame prawn fritters - shallow fried]]

===Ingredients===
| 6 oz (150g) any white fish
| 4 oz (100g) peeled prawns
| 1 egg white
| 1 heaped tablespoon of cornflour
| 1 tablespoon rice wine or dry sherry
| 1.5 tablespoons sesame oil
| 3 tablespoons sesame seeds 


===Mise en place===
* Preheat the oven to 220C/425F/gas 7

===Method===


| Remove any skin and bones from the fish
| Mince or finely chop the prawns
| Mix the prawns and fish together well, then add the remaining ingredients apart from the sesame seeds.
| Mix very well
| Shape into flat discs (about the size of a jam-pot lid)
| Coat with sesame seeds
| Place on a lightly oiled tray the top of the oven for 10-15 minutes or until golden brown
===Serving suggestions===

Serve hot with a dip such as sweet and sour sauce, sesame and hoisin dip,tomato and chili dip or peanut sauce and slivers of fresh red chillies.

===Chef's note===

These could of course be shallow fried or even deep fried, this was just a healthy experiment.  They come out quite nice, though not as golden as they would if they were fried.
===Variations===
Made this again recently and added lots of chopped parsley and a tablespoon or so of masa harina to bind the mixture and add a slightly different flavour.
