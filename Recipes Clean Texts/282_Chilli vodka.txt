Don't see the point of vodka, and even less; the reason to waste nice chillies on it!

===Description===

[[Image:Chilli vodka ingredients.jpg|300px|thumb|right|Chilli vodka - the ingredients]]
In general I am not keen on spirits but I do like the occasional Bloody Mary.  Vodka doesn't have much of a taste, so it is nice to have some to hand which is already spiced and therefore there is no need to add Tabasco.
===Ingredients===

| 500ml vodka
| 1 teaspoon fenugreek seeds
| 1 teaspoon cumin seeds
| 1 cinnamon stick
| Dried chillies to taste - I used 5 small ones.  Remember you need to be able to get them back out of the bottle!
| 3 cardamon pods slightly bruised

===Method===


| Put all of the spices into a clean, sterlised bottle.
| Top up with vodka, leaving a gap at the top to allow room for shaking.
| Shake the bottle from time to time and it should be ready in two months, or a little less.
| It will keep for up to one year.
===Serving suggestions===
Make a Bloody Mary with tomato juice, a little lemon juice and celery salt
===Chef's notes===
It is better to use too many chillies than too few.  If it ends up too spicy, you can always add more vodka to tone it down a bit
