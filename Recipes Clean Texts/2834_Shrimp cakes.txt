===Description===

Robin has kindly given me permission to use this wonderful recipe and pictures that appeared on her [http://www.flickr.com/photos/fotoosvanrobin/ Flickr feed].

Wonderfully simple and delicious - food doesn't get much better than this for me!

===Ingredients===
| 200 g potatoes
| 450 g pink prawns (or shrimp), cooked
| 1 large egg
| Â½ a red chilli, chopped finely
| 1 teaspoon grated ginger
| Salt to taste
| 1 cup of chopped coriander
| 2 spring onions, chopped
| Breadcrumbs
| Vegetable oil for frying


===Mise en place===
* Boil and mash the potatoes and let them cool - don't add any milk or butter.
===Method===


| Add the prawns, egg, ginger, chilli and salt to a food processor with a metal blade and pulse until roughly combined.
| Fork the mixture into the mashed potatoes, together with the coriander and spring onions
| Form into little balls and flatten them into small discs.
| Press the edges and both sides of the cakes into breadcrumbs and pan-fry them in vegetable oil for 4 minutes a side

===Serving suggestions===
''User:Robin's serving suggestion'':

Serve with some mayonnaise, mixed with lots of very finely chopped onion and a good amount of wasabi-paste. (There isn't any onion in the wasabi mayonnaise in the photo, but trust me, it's nicer with it.)
===Chef's notes===
When you make mash, make double or treble the amount and freeze the remainder in single or double portion plastic bags.  Great for recipes like this!
