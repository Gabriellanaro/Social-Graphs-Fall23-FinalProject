Makes a great barbecue too.

A unique flavour, but the vinegar is quite hard to get hold of.

===Description===

A similar dish to Barbecued balsamic chicken fillets but using mainly Chinese ingredients, the key one being Chinkiang rice vinegar (Chinese black vinegar) which is similar to balsamic vinegar.

Rather than barbecuing, I am using my Breville Panini Press as the weather is being typically English today.

===Ingredients===
| 4 skinless chicken breasts or 8 chicken drumsticks
| 4 tablespoons of Chinkiang rice vinegar
| 2 teaspoons demerara sugar, jaggery, brown or muscovado sugar
| 1 tablespoon dark soy sauce
| 1 tablespoon of Szechuan peppercorns, crushed or whizzed in a coffee grinder
| 1 tablespoon olive oil
| A handful of fresh parsley - coriander would have been more appropriate, but I have none today, so opted for the parsley
| Pinch of salt
===Method===


| Add the Chinkiang rice vinegar, soy sauce, sugar, olive oil and salt and Szechuan peppercorns to a bowl and mix well
| Cut a few slashes into either side of the chicken pieces
| Add the chicken pieces to the mixture and marinate for a good few hours in a cool place, turning now and again. ''(Cover with aluminium foil or cling film to stop the cats getting at them - as well as airborne bacteria)''
| Cook the chicken on preheated sandwich press for 12 minutes, turning once.  A barbecue hotplate would take about the same time but you will need to turn it more often.
| Sprinkle with the freshly chopped herbs 
===Serving suggestions===
Serve hot with plain rice and a salad.
