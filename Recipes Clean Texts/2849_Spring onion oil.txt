This Vietnamese condiment is great with noodles and soups and is a brilliant way to use up the glut from the garden before they go to seed.

It will keep for 2 weeks if sealed and refrigerated

===Ingredients===
| 250 ml (8 fl oz) groundnut oil or vegetable oil  (olive oil would be healthier, but not authentic)
| 16 spring onions,washed, trimmed and very finely sliced on the diagonal
| 2.5 cm (1\") ginger root, peeled and sliced
===Method===


| Heat the oil in a pan and add the ginger and spring onions
| Fry for about 10 to 15 minutes until the spring onions turn golden
| Keep the heat on the low side to ensure you don't burn the ingredients as this may bring out unpleasant flavours.
| Allow to cool fully and then strain or sieve out all the solids
| Store in sealed jars in the fridge
