A slight modification of Ken Hom recipe that is a must if like me, you love chillies, garlic and sweetcorn.  Prepare and cook it in minutes, delicious!

I've used this dish as an opportunity to use some of the delicious dried chillies from the Cool Chile Co.  Re-hydrate them by soaking in just boilded water for 20 minutes.

===Ingredients===
| 2 whole ears of sweetcorn or 175 g (6 oz) frozen or canned corn kernels
| 1.5 tablespoons peanut oil
| 2 small fresh red chillies, de-seeded and cut into small rings, ''or rehydrated, chile pasilla and 3 chile de \u00c1rbole''
| 5 cloves garlic, peeled and crushed
| ½ teaspoon sea salt
| ¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
| 1 teaspoon white sugar
| 50 ml (2 fl oz) vegetable stock


===Mise en place===
*Strip the kernels from the cob if using whole kernels
*Blanch frozen sweetcorn in boiling water for 10 seconds
===Method===


| Heat the oil in a wok
| Add the chillies , garlic and sweetcorn and stir-fry for 1 minute
| Add the stock, pepper and sugar and cook for another 3 minutes
| Serve immediately
