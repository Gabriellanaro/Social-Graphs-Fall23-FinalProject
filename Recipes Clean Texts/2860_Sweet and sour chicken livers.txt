An unusual way to serve liver, the addition of pineapple makes this fabulously fruity.

===Description===


A economical and tasty Chinese dish for those who love the combination of offal and fruit!  Absolutely gorgeous!

===Ingredients===
| 2 tablespoons groundnut oil
| 450 g (1 lb) Chicken livers, rinsed, dried, trimmed and cut into bite-sized pieces.
| 4 to 6 tablespoons of yellow cornmeal.
| 2 green bell peppers, de-seeded and cut into chunks.
| 4 slices of canned pineapple rings cut into chunks.
| 4 tablespoons chicken stock.
'''Sweet and sour sauce'''
* 2 tablespoons cornflour.
* 100g (4 oz) white sugar.
* 2 tablespoons light soy sauce.
* 120 ml (4 fl oz) white wine vinegar.
* 120 ml (4 fl oz) water.

===Method===


| Add the cornmeal to a plate and roll the chicken livers around so they are well coated.
| Heat the oil and fry the chicken livers in batches until they are nicely browned.  Set aside and keep warm.
| Add the peppers to the wok and stir-fry for 4 minutes on a very high heat so they brown up a little.
| Add the stock and the pineapple chunks, bring to the boil, cover and simmer for 4 minutes.
| Mix the cornflour to a paste with a little of the water. Add to the remaining sweet and sour sauce ingredients and stir into the wok, heat and allow to thicken.  It will turn all of a sudden. Once it has thickened, mix well and remove from the heat.
| Pour the sauce over the chicken livers.

===Serving suggestions===
Serve immediately with plain boiled rice.
===variations===
The Chilli-heads amongst you, may like to add some Tabasco sauce or chilli oil to this just before serving.
===Chef's note===
Don't be alarmed by the quantity and liquidity of the sweet and sour sauce before it is cooked.  It will thicken up once cooked.

I find that rolling the chicken livers in yellow cornmeal gives an nice crunchy texture, though it's probably not very authentic.
