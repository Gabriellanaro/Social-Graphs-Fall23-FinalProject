| 1 tablespoon light soy sauce
| Squeeze of lemon juice.
| 1 tablespoon rice wine or dry sherry
| 1 level teaspoon sea salt
| 1 tablespoon cornflour
===Method===


| Mix the cornflour with a tablespoons of cold water and set aside.
| Heat the oil and stir-fry the ginger and garlic for a minute or until the garlic starts to colour.
