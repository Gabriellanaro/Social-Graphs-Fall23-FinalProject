I much prefer this to the greasy chip-shop version.  It can be difficult to buy the big cans or roe, but they are out there if you search for them.

 

The Judge

Fresh cod roe is a seasonal [January to March - UK] and difficult to buy fresh outside of this period.  However, if like me you're a fan of chip shop style cod roe then you're in luck as almost all fried cod roe served in fish and chip shops is canned, and very reasonably priced too.

For greater economy, buy the 600 g can instead of the 200 g tin, cut the roe into 100g slices and freeze the remaining segments for later use.
===Ingredients===

| 200g can Princes pressed cod roe
| 2 tablespoons plain flour
| 1 egg, beaten with 1 tablespoon cold water
| 75g Panko or dried breadcrumbs (flavoured with lemon and black pepper, if possible)
| Olive oil, for frying
| 2 tablespoons of fresh soured cream
| Chopped fresh dill or parsley (optional)
| Salad leaves, to serve

===Method===


| Carefully remove the cod roe from the can, in one piece. Slice through the middle horizontally to make two 100 g rounds.
| Put the flour onto a plate and coat each cod roe round lightly with it, then dip into the beaten egg, making sure they are coated around the sides. Finally, dip into the breadcrumbs to coat completely.
|  Heat the vegetable oil in a frying pan and cook the roe fish cakes for 3 to 4 minutes on each side, turning them over carefully with a fish slice. Drain on kitchen paper.
===Serving suggestions===
Serve the fish cakes with soured cream and chopped fresh dill or parsley,  accompanied by a green salad.

===Variations===
If you have access to a smoker, these are really good if the cod roe is smoked for an hour or so before frying.
