Fab idea, might even work on frozen-then-defrosted chip shop chips?

===Description===

So simple, so obvious yet I've only just thought of doing this.

Cook your own special main meal element like a nice fillet steak, special sausages, steak and kidney pie, you get the idea. Then serve it with chips from your favourite chip shop.

If you have a willing victim (''partner'') then you can probably get them collected directly from the chip shop and serve them straight to the plate.

If not then we find keeping them wrapped in a warm oven, then refresh by heating in an Air Fryer for 10 minutes or by stir-frying in a very hot wok for a minute or two.

However you cook homemade chips, you can;t beat chips from a good fish and chip shop.

===Ingredients===
===Ingredients===
| 1 large bag of chips from the chip shop
| A pinch of salt

===Method===

| Add the chips to the air-fryer
| Add a pinch of salt
| Shake well to distribute evenly
| Cook for 5 to 10 minutes
