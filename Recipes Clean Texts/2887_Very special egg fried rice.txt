===Description===

I made this to accompany slow-cooked star anise beef, and as the ingredients were odd bits and bobs from the fridge.  Well it was brilliant and did not really need the beef after all.

It had an almost lemony taste, which I guess was the high amount of pickled items used.

===Ingredients===
| 350ml cooked and drained boiled rice from 1 cup of basmati rice
| 2 tablespoons peanut oil
| 1 onion, peeled and sliced
| 2 heaped tablespoons finely chopped ginger root - I used bottled from the fridge as it keeps so well
| 3 cloves garlic, crushed
| ½ cup dried shrimp, soaked in just boiled water for 15 minutes, drained and chopped
| 1 large pickled chili, chopped, with some seeds and a little vinegar, ''(pictured)''
| 2 pickled roast red peppers, chopped with some of the vinegar, ''(pictured)''
| 2 sun-dried tomatoes in oil, chopped, with a little of the oil, ''(pictured)''
| 4 spring onions, chopped on the diagonal
| 2 free range eggs, whisked with 2 teaspoons of sesame oil
| 1 tablespoon light soy sauce
===Method===


| Heat the oil in a wok and fry the onion, ginger and garlic on a high heat for 3 minutes
| Stir in the rice and mix well
| Add the chopped shrimp, peppers, tomatoes and chillies, mix well, reduce the heat and and cook until the rice is heated.  About 4 minutes if the rice was cold
| Make a well in the rice and add the egg mixture, stir to cook evenly and then mix to distribute
| Add the soy sauce and spring onions, stir well and serve
===Variations===

Fry a little chopped bacon with the garlic.

Try a little sliced Chinese sausage instead of the bacon.
