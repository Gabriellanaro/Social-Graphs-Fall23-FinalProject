===Serving suggestions===
This was a full meal and did not need any other accompaniment. 
===Chef's notes===
Well this recipe turned out to be a bit of a trial. Following the original recipe, it was plain that there would not nearly enough liquid to cover the potatoes which meant that it could never be cooked on the hob. Adding more liquid to accommodate that would have turned it into soup.  
I decided to oven cook it, except the oven broke down when I tried to use it, so the half finished dish had to be refrigerated and begun again the next day.  I decided to par boil the thinly sliced potatoes as I didn't want them to be undercooked.  Eventually it was a fantastic tasting (and looking) meal, but probably not as originally intended - the benefit of testing recipes first!

The recipe above is my modified version, you can see the original by viewing the ''history'' tab above.
