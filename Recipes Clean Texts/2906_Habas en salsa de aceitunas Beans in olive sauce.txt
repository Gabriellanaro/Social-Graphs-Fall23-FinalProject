They are close to Lima beans and taste better to my mind.

===Description===

Lima beans are traditionally used to make this first course from Peru, but as they can be hard to find in the UK, use haricot beans instead.

===Ingredients===
| 675 g dried haricot or baby lima beans, soaked overnight
| 1.9 litres water
| 2 Dried aj\u00ed rojo chillies, soaked and finely chopped
| 1 tablespoon grated ginger
| A further 190 ml hot water 
| 340 g Kalamata olives, stoned
| A further 120 ml water, or as necessary
| 2 tablespoons olive oil
| Garlic to taste, crushed
| 10 large spring onions, white part only, julienned, and soaked in iced water
| 3 sticks celery, julienned, and soaked in iced water
| ½ teaspoon salt
| ½ teaspoon freshly-ground black pepper
| The juice of ½ a lemon
===Method===


| Drain the beans in a colander and combine them in a large saucepan with the 1.9 litres of water.
| Bring up to the boil, then reduce the heat so that the water is simmering. 
| Cook the beans, covered, for 35 to 40 minutes, or until just tender. Drain and set aside. 
| In a blender, combine the chillies and the ginger with 190 ml of hot water and blend until smooth. Set the mixture aside. 
| Again in the blender, mix the olives with the 120 ml of water, or just enough to make them move through the blades, and blend until completely smooth. Set this mixture aside. 
| In a large pan, heat the olive oil over medium heat. 
| Stir in the garlic, then immediately add the chilli/ginger mixture. 
| Cook for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until most of the liquid has evaporated. 
| Add the pur\u00e9ed olive mixture, reduce the heat to low, and cook for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the beans and continue cooking for 15 to 20 minutes, stirring gently every few minutes. 
| Remove from the heat, and allow to cool to room temperature. 
| When the beans are cool, drain the spring onion and celery and, in a small bowl, toss them with salt, pepper, and lemon juice. 
| Serve the beans garnished with the spring onion and celery.
