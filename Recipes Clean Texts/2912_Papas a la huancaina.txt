Huancayo is a town situated about 3,000 metres above sea level in the Peruvian Andes.  It is the first Latin American meal I made and is great for vegetarians.

===Ingredients===
| 60ml lemon juice
| Large pinch of cayenne pepper
| Seasoning
| 1 medium onion, thinly sliced
| 8 medium potatoes
| 340 g fresh cheese (cottage cheese) or Caerphilly cheese, roughly chopped
| 4 or more aj\u00ed amarillo chillies, chopped
| Â½ teaspoon turmeric
| 280 ml double cream
| 140 ml olive oil
| 30g Lettuce leaves
| 200 g sweetcorn, cooked
| Olives
| 4 eggs, hard-boiled and cut in half
| 1 garlic clove

===Mise en place===
* Make a marinade with the lemon juice, cayenne pepper and seasoning and add the onions rings.  
* Leave at room temperature for a few hours.  
* If using dried aj\u00ed amarillo chillies, allow to soak in hot, but not boiling water for 20 minutes to allow them to rehydrate.
===Method===


| Boil the potatoes in their skins until cooked.
| Peel and keep warm.
| Meanwhile blend the cheese, lemon,turmeric and the cream in a liquidiser or food processor until smooth.
| In a pan, heat the oil, add the onions, garlic and rehydrated chillies. Add this sauted ingredients to the previous sauce and blend until smooth. At the end add a little oil to make it brighter.
| Make a bed of lettuce leaves on a large plate.
| Place the potatoes on the top and pour the sauce over them.
| Sprinkle with the sweetcorn and olives and arrange the eggs on the top.
