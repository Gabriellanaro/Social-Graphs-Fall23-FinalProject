 The Judge 
===Description===

We recently cooked a shoulder of pork just with a little wine in the slow cooker for about 6 hours and the resulting pulled pork provided lots of different meals.  This one, unlike the original slow cooked pork shoulder has a whole manner of different flavourings.

We both chose three of each for ourselves, marked them with cocktail sticks so we knew which ones were ours.

The results were fabulous.
===Ingredients===

| 400g unflavoured pulled pork, already cooked
| 5 spring onions, finely chopped
| Half a sweet red pepper, finely chopped
| 60g cheddar cheese
| 6 small white flour tortillas
====flavours====
===Ingredients===NB
| 1 tablespoon branston pickle
| 1 teaspoon curry powder
| 1 teaspoon Taste Sensation Jalapeno and Lime Seasoning
| 1 teaspoon Taste Sensation Mexican seasoning
| 1 teaspoon Taste Sensation fajita seasoning
| 1 teaspoon Taste Sensation Tangy Chipotle Marinade
| A quick spray of olive oil
===Mise en place===

* Preheat your oven to 180\u00b0 C (350\u00b0 F - gas 4), [fan oven 160\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]
