The Judge 

Using Peruvian Rocoto chillies, gives this hot and sweet tropical chilli jam a depth of flavour that works well with meat, fish and as a dip too!

===Ingredients===

| 360 grams Rocoto chilli paste
| 150 grams Mango pulp
| 650 grams sugar
| 2 lemons

===Method===


| Place the chilli paste into a large saucepan and add the sugar and mango pulp.  Juice the lemons and add the juice to the other ingredients.  Mix well with a wooden spoon.
| Bring slowly to the boil and simmer, stirring occasionally.  Keep an eye on it and test the jam by placing a small dab of the mixture onto a cool plate.  If it gels quickly, within seconds, it is ready.  Remove from the heat.
| Pour the jam into clean sterilised jars and seal.  Allow the jars to cool and then process them in a water bath for about 30 minutes.  Allow to cool completely.  Remove from the water bath, dry the jars, and slap on some labels.
| The jam will keep, stored in a cool dry place, for a long time.
