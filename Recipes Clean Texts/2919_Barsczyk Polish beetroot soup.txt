===Description===

A Polish version of the Russian borscht.  You will need to start this at least 5 days in advance.

'''For the ferment'''
===Ingredients===
| 500g raw beetroot, julienned
| A slice of pumpernickel or 1 teaspoon live brewers' yeast
| 1.2 litres boiled water
'''For the barsczyk'''
===Ingredients===NB
| 3 medium carrots, scraped and julienned
| 2 medium onions, finely sliced
| 500 g raw beetroot, julienned
| 1.2 litres vegetable stock
| 600 ml consomm\u00e9
| 250 g mushrooms, finely sliced
| 1 tablespoon sugar
| 8 sprigs parsley
| 4 cloves garlic, crushed
| 125 ml gutsy red wine or port
| Lemon juice, if required
===Method===
'''For the ferment'''

| Place the beetroot and the boiled water in a bowl and place the bread or brewers' yeast on the top.
| Cover and keep in a warm place where the temperature is constant for 5 days.
| It should be frothy and the froth should be skimmed once the 5 days are up.
| Strain through butter muslin, pour into a jar or bottle and place in the fridge.
| It should keep for several weeks.
'''For the barsczyk'''

| In a large saucepan bring the carrots, onions and beetroot to a boil in the vegetable stock.
| Reduce the heat and simmer for about an hour.
| Strain and discard the vegetables, returning the liquid to the pan.
| Cook the mushrooms in the consomm\u00e9 and again, discard them.
| Add the mushroom liquid, 600ml of the fermented beetroot juice and red wine or port to the pan containing the liquid in which the vegetables were boiled.
| You should now have a total of 2.5 litres of liquid - if you have more, reduce it down.
| Taste, and add lemon juice if it is not tart enough.
===Serving suggestions===
Serve garnished with chopped dill or chives.  Swirl in a little cream if desired.
===Chef's notes===
Do not use vinegar to replace the lemon juice as the Polish say that using vinegar is a Russian idea.
