===Description===

This is really an aide-m\u00e9moire to myself; I made this recently and it was excellent.

I already make curry sauce to an almost industrial scale and freeze the sauces in two-person quantities.  A few simple additions have brought this simple curry top another level.

We always have frozen chorizo, peas and king prawns, so this is such an easy recipe.

I generally do this in the slow cooker as it's so easy that way - just chuck everything in and stir it now and then.
===Ingredients===

| 1 portion of curry sauce - defrosted
| 1 pack of chorizo slices or diced chorizo pieces
| ½ can of coconut milk
| 1 cup of frozen peas, defrosted
| 1 small onion, finely chopped
| 12 king prawns, defrosted

===Method===


| Add everything except for the peas and the king prawns to your slow cooker
| Cook on high for 2 to 3 hours
| Stir now and then if you are able
| Add the king prawns and peas for the last 10 minutes of cooking

===Serving suggestions===
Serve with naan breads and a vegetable - air fried butternut squash was good with this.
===Chef's notes===
As we make this recipe regularly. we freeze the remaining ½ can of coconut milk for the next time - it freezes really well in a plastic bag.
