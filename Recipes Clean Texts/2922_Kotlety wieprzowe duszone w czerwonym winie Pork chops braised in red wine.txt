===Description===

A very easy winter recipe from Poland.

| Pinch of ground cinnamon
| 120 ml red wine
===Method===


| Heat the oil in a deep frying pan and brown the pork on both sides.

| Return the pork to the pan and add the remaining ingredients.

===Chef's notes===
I would check the pan from time to time, to ensure that it does not dry out.  If it does, add a little water or stock.

Making this for 2 people, I used 2 fairly large pork shoulder steaks, added a few extra mushrooms but kept the remaining ingredients the same. It needed a little extra reduction at the end.  A very nice recipe.
