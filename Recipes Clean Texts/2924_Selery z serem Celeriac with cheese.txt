===Description===

Polish style celeriac 'au gratin'

===Ingredients===
| 900 g celeriac, peeled
| 1 tablespoon white wine vinegar
| 350 g Cheddar cheese, grated
| 50 g butter
| 1 teaspoon sugar
| 2 teaspoons salt
| Pinch of black pepper
| 150 ml sour cream
| 1 tablespoon flour, mixed to a paste with 3 tablespoons water
| 4 tablespoons lightly toasted fresh breadcrumbs
===Method===


| Half fill a large pan with lightly salted water.
| Bring to the boil and add the whole but peeled celeriac and the vinegar.
| Boil for about 20 minutes or until slightly soft.
| Drain, and when cool enough to handle, cut the celeriac into 3 mm slices.
| Grease a large casserole dish and fill with alternate layers of celeriac and cheese, dotting each layer with butter and sprinkled salt, pepper and sugar.
| Finish with a layer of cheese.
| In a bowl, mix the sour cream and the flour and water mixture.
| Pour over the top of the cheese.
| Sprinkle over the breadcrumbs and bake for 20-25 minutes at 180\u00b0 C (350\u00b0 F - gas 4).
| If the top has not browned, you can finish it off under a hot grill.
===Serving suggestions===
Serve with rye bread, salad and pickles.
===Variations===
Try with other root vegetables such as turnips, swede, parsnips etc or a mixture of them.
