Makes a nice change to normal rice, and not too difficult to make.

===Description===

This is called 'naughty' rice because although the rice should not be too dry, you can make it a bit on the wet side by using arborio or paella rice, rather than long-grain rice.

===Ingredients===
| 2 tablespoons olive oil
| 1 onion, finely diced
| Garlic to taste, finely diced
| 2 large ripe tomatoes, peeled, seeded and diced (use tinned ones if ripe ones are not available)
| 2 tablespoons parsley, chopped
| 500 ml water or vegetable stock
| 225 g arborio or paella rice
| Seasoning
===Method===


| Heat the oil in a deep frying pan and cook the onions and garlic until they onion is transparent (about 10 minutes).
| Add the tomatoes and parsley and cook for a further 5 minutes.
| Add the water or stock, bring to the boil and add the rice and seasoning.
| Simmer for about 25 minutes and serve.
===Serving suggestions===
Excellent on its own as a snack or with fish or offal.

===Chef's notes===
We used just one bulb of garlic as we had already added two bulbs to the Iscas a Lisboa.
