===Description===

A very quick and easy dish from the Algarve.

===Ingredients===
| 4 x 150 g tuna steaks
| 100 g lard (use 100 ml olive oil instead if you prefer)
| 1 large onion, diced
| Garlic to taste, diced
| 3 tablespoons parsley, chopped
| Salt and pepper, to taste
===Method===


| Heat the lard or oil in a large pan.
| Add onions, garlic and fry gently for about 8 minutes or until all the ingredients are cooked.
| Turn the heat up a little, add the tuna and fry for 3 or 4 minutes a side, turning once.
| Mix in the parsley, cover with tin foil and allow to rest for 5 minutes before serving.
===Serving suggestions===
Serve with boiled or fried potatoes, or rice cooked with clams or cockles.
