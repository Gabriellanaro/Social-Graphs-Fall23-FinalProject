===Description===

This was a fantastic meal and so economical - 6 sausages made meatballs for four people!

We also had the luxury of catching our home grown asparagus tips before   they went to seed.

This is a great recipe to use as an inspiration for an idea of your own.
===Ingredients===

| 2 tablespoons olive oil 
| sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
| 1 500g packet of passata - a can of chopped tomatoes would work
| 2 white onions, peeled and chopped
| 4 cloves of garlic, peeled and chopped
| A handful of freshly chopped herbs or half a teaspoon of dried mixed herbs
| 18 meatballs meatballs made from sausages
| 2 portions of bubble and squeak made from 3 large potatoes and a quarter of a white cabbage
| 4 asparagus spears
===Mise en place===

* Preheat your oven to 190\u00b0 C (375\u00b0 F - gas 5), [fan oven 170\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]

===Method===


| Make up the  bubble and squeak from cooked potatoes and white cabbage and shape into circles with an egg ring or by hand. I also added a tablespoon of mustard seeds and a little onion as well.
| Place on a greased baking tray or silicone baking mat and bake for 35 minutes - a dribble of olive oil on the top helps to brown the top.
| Add 2 tablespoons of olive oil to a frying pan together with a good pinch of black pepper
| Saute the onions for 4 minutes then add the chopped garlic and cook for a further 3 minutes, add the passata, mixed herbs and optionally, a splash of red wine.
| If the meatballs are made from raw sausages, add them now, if they are already cooked, pop them in the sauce for the last ten minutes. 
| Simmer for 30 minutes on a low heat, stirring now and then.  This will reduce the sauce a little
| Steam the asparagus for 5 minutes and serve
===Variations===
Our Tomato sauce for pizza would also make a great sauce for this recipe.
