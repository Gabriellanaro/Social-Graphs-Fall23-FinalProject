The basic ingredients are mashed potatoes, mashed onions and minced collard greens, savoy cabbage, or kale. Common flavouring ingredients are garlic and salt. Before serving, slices of chouri\u00e7o are also often added as well as olive oil. It is usually accompanied by slices of Portuguese broa bread on the side.

===Ingredients===
| Olive oil for saut\u00e9ing
| 1 large onion, peeled and finely chopped
| 6 cloves of Garlic, peeled and crushed (or to taste)
| 6 medium potatoes, peeled and thinly sliced
| 450 g (1 lb) greens of choice: (collard greens, savoy cabbage, kale or a mixture of all  three), jullienned

| 225 g chorizo sausage, casing removed and cut into 5 mm (Â¼\u201d) discs
| 2 teaspoons smoked paprika or to taste
| sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
| Olive oil for dressing
===Method===


| Heat 3 or 4 tablespoons of olive oil in a Dutch oven and gently saut\u00e9 the onion and garlic until the onion is translucent, about 5 minutes or so
| Add the potatoes and half of the greens and heat and shimmy until the cabbage wilts a little
| Add the water and bring to the boil, reduce and simmer until the potatoes are soft.  About 15 to 20 minutes
| Pur\u00e9e the cooked mixture, in batches if necessary, and return to the heat
| Ass the sausage, remaining cabbage and season with paprika, salt and pepper
| Cook for 5 to 10 minutes or until the greens are cooked to your liking
