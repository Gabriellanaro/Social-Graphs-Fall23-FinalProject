===Serving suggestions===
Traditionally this is served on slices of fried bread.
===Variations===
If you cannot get the ham, substitute it with 8 rashers of unsmoked back bacon, which have been grilled.

I added about 6 cloves of crushed garlic and used sliced chorizo instead of the ham.  Although it does not look that great, it has been hailed a success and already been requested again! --Chef 09:37, 13 March 2011 (GMT)
