This recipe from Madeira uses a fish whose Latin name is ''Lepturacanthus savala'' and has many names throughout the world.  In India, it is called ribbon fish (not to be confused with ribbon fish of the ''Trachipteridae'' family).  It can also be called cutlass fish (amongst others) and in Portugal is called espada (meaning sword and not to be confused with swordfish).  Similarly in France, it is known as scabbard sword fish.  In the UK, it is sold as ribbon fish, because it comes from India.  It is a very inexpensive fish and in the UK can be obtain frozen from '''[http://www.frozenfishdirect.co.uk/?gclid=CLvz_Jv3urYCFajLtAodtxwA4g Frozen Fish Direct]'''.
