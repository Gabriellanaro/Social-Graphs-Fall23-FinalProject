Making this tonight with freshly picked broad beans.  Should go nicely with a beef curry.

===Description===

[[Image:Dried broad beans.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Large dried broad beans]]
This simple recipe from Lisbon uses dried broad beans which can be obtained from ethnic shops.  They are often labelled as fava beans.

===Ingredients===
| 450 g dried broad beans
| Garlic to taste, finely diced
| 60 ml olive oil
| 1 tablespoon white wine vinegar
| Seasoning


===Mise en place===
* Soak the beans for a minimum of 15 hours in cold water.
===Method===


| Drain and rinse the beans, and boil in salted water until cooked. 
| Leaving the beans in the cooking water, gently fry the garlic in the olive oil until golden.  Use a deepish pan for this.
| Whilst the garlic is cooking, drain the beans and then mix them with the garlic and oil, together with the wine vinegar.
| Mash some (not all) of the beans and boil for a few minutes.
| Serve hot.
===Serving suggestions===
An excellent accompaniment to meat or fish.
===Variations===
Although not so authentic, you can add other flavourings such as herbs, spices or lemon juice.
===Chef's notes===
When looking for the dried broad beans, make sure they are brownish-green and labelled as dried broad beans or fava beans.  I have noticed that some mis-informed characters on the WWW have stated that they are the same as butter beans, which they are not.  Do not be deceived!
