===Description===

This liver speciality from Lisbon should be started the preceding day.

===Ingredients===
| 280 ml dry white wine
| 30 ml white wine vinegar
| 1 bay leaf
| Garlic, to taste, crushed
| 6 peppercorns
| 2 cloves
| Â½ teaspoon salt
| 675 g pig's or lamb's liver, thinly sliced
| 30 ml olive oil
| 110 g smoked back bacon, diced


===Mise en place===
* In a large bowl, mix the wine, vinegar, bay leaf, garlic, peppercorns, cloves, salt and liver.  
* Cover and keep in the fridge overnight, turning the liver from time to time.
===Method===


| Remove the liver and pat the slices dry.
| Heat the oil in a frying pan, add the bacon and saut\u00e9 for 3 minutes.
| Add the liver and cook for 3 minutes on each side.
| Transfer the liver and bacon to a heated dish.
| Strain the marinade into the pan and boil quickly until reduced and thickened.
| Pour over the liver and serve.
===Serving suggestions===
Serve with fried potato slices.
===Variations===
Use red wine and wine vinegar instead.

Before frying, I dredged the liver pieces in a tablespoon of plain flour and a tablespoon of cornmeal, seasoned with salt and pepper and also added 6 thinly sliced button mushrooms.  A very nice dish, we will have this again.
===Chef's note===
