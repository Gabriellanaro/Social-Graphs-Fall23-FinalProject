===Description===

'''Pork with garlic and vinegar''', probably a forerunner to the famous Indian vindaloo dishes that the Portuguese brought to their colony of Goa on the western coast of India.

For best results, the pork needs to marinate for 48 hours, so you need to plan in advance for this recipe.

'''Marinade'''
===Ingredients===
| 200 ml (7 fl oz) vinho verdhe white wine
| 2 tablespoons sherry vinegar
| 4 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed
| 1 clove bud
| 4 bay leaves
| 2 tablespoons paprika
'''For the stew'''
===Ingredients===NB
| 675g (1.5 lb) lean leg of pork, trimmed of gristle, skin and fat
| 1 tablespoon olive oil
| 40g (1.5 oz) ghee or butter
| 225 g (8 oz) onions, peeled and chopped finely
| 6 cloves of Garlic, peeled and crushed
| sea salt


===Mise en place===
* Cut the meat in to 4 cm (1.5 \") cubes.
* Process all of the marinade ingredients to a thin paste in a food processor or blender.
* Mix the meat and marinade together in a non-metallic bowl, cover and refrigerate for 48 hours.
* Preheat the oven to 190\u00b0 C (375\u00b0 F - gas 5)

===Method===


| Heat the ghee and oil in a wok and stir-fry the onions and garlic for 10 minutes until softened.
| Add the onions and garlic, meat and marinade to a large casserole dish, mix well, cover and cook for 1 hour.
| Check it every 20 minutes and add a little extra water if it starts to dry out.
| Taste and season with salt before serving.
===Serving suggestions===
Serve with plain boiled rice and sweetcorn.
===Chef's notes===
The original authentic recipe called for 4 clove buds which, with the similarly flavoured bay leaves, I found a little overpowering and have therefore reduced the recipe to one clove.  This was a delicious dish that, strangely, gave the pork the texture, and to my mind, the flavour of beef. Although not authentic, I added a few chopped tomatoes as they were spare, and a few chillies for good measure too. Well worth making.
