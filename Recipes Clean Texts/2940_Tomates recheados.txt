===Description===

From Portugal, this is a recipe for tomatoes stuffed with prawns and cream cheese.

===Ingredients===
| 8 large tomatoes, skinned
| Salt and pepper
| 115 g cream cheese
| 340 g peeled prawns
| 2 tablespoons chives, snipped
| 55 ml double cream
| Garlic to taste, crushed
| Watercress, to garnish
===Method===


| Slice off the top of each tomato and remove the pulp and seeds.
| Sprinkle the tomatoes with salt and turn upside down to drain.
| Meanwhile, mix the remaining ingredients, except the watercress and stuff the tomatoes.
| Put on the tomato tops and serve with the watercress and some vinaigrette.
===Chef's notes===
You can leave the tomato skins on if you wish, in which case, brush the tomatoes on the outside with olive oil.
