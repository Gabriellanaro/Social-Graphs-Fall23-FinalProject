[[Image:The Parson's nose, removed.jpg|300px|thumb|right|The Parson's nose, removed]] 
One of Romania's many sour soups.

===Ingredients===
| 1 chicken weighing about 1.5 kg - parson's nose removed
| 1 bay leaf
| Pinch of ground allspice
| 3 medium onions, peeled and sliced
| 3 carrots, peeled and julienned
| 1 celeriac, peeled and julienned
| 1 parsley root (if you can find one), peeled and chopped
| Seasoning
| ½ cabbage, sliced
| 150 ml single cream
| 1 tablespoon white wine vinegar
| 3 egg yolks, beaten
| Dill and savory, finely chopped, to garnish
===Method===


| Put the chicken in a large saucepan with the bay leaf, allspice, vegetables and a little salt.
| Cover with cold water.
| Bring to the boil 3 times, skim and add a little cold water each time to send the cloudy bits to the bottom.
| Simmer for 1¼-1½ hours until the chicken is tender, adding the cabbage 15 minutes before the end of the cooking time.
| Mix the cream, vinegar and eggs yolks and ladle some hot broth from the saucepan into the mixture, mixing well.
| Remove the pan from the heat and the chicken from the pan.
| Stir the egg mixture into the soup - do not boil again.
| Serve hot, garnished with the dill and savory.
===Serving suggestions===
Serve with hearty bread.
===Chef's notes===
The chicken need not be wasted as you can use it for another recipe which calls for cooked chicken, or in sandwiches.
