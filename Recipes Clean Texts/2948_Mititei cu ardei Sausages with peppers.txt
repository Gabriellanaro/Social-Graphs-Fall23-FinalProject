===Description===

A street food recipe of skinless sausages from Romania.  You need to start the peppers the day before the sausages.

===Ingredients===
| 500 g green or red peppers, skins removed (see '''here''') and sliced
| Oil
| White wine vinegar
| 500 g beef, finely minced
| Garlic cloves, to taste, crushed
| Salt and pepper, to taste
| 1 tablespoon summer savory, finely chopped
| Â½ teaspoon allspice, ground


===Mise en place===
* Marinate (overnight) the pepper slices in a dressing of 3 parts oil to 1 part vinegar, salt and pepper.
===Method===


| Mix the mince with the garlic, salt, pepper, savory and allspice and leave for 2 hours for the flavours to blend.
| Put the grill onto its highest heat.
| Meanwhile, with wet hands, shape the meat mixture into short sausages, about 2.5 cm thick.
| Brush the hot grill with oil and put the sausages on the grill to cook.
| They should take about 7-8 minutes in total and you will need to turn them once.
===Serving suggestions===
Serve with some bread and the marinated peppers.
===Variations===
You can use lamb or pork if you wish, but beef is the meat of preference.
