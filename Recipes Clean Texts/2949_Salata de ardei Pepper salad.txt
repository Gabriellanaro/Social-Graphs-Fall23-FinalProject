===Description===

[[Image:Salata de ardei lock box.jpg|300px|thumb|right|Use a Lock and Lock box to coat the peppers with the dressing]]
A Romanian grilled pepper salad which is can be served as a first course or an accompaniment.

===Ingredients===
| 8 sweet peppers any colour or a mixture, roasted, cut into quarters, seeded and skins rubbed off.  See here for instructions.
| Garlic to taste, crushed
| 75 ml olive oil
| 60 ml white wine vinegar
| 4 tomatoes, sliced
| 1 red onion, thinly sliced
| A good pinch of salt
| Freshly ground black pepper
| Coriander sprigs to garnish
===Method===


| Arrange the peppers, tomatoes and onion slices on four serving plates.
| Mix the garlic, olive oil and vinegar and pour over the salad on each plate.
| Garnish with the coriander and serve.
===Serving suggestions===
It is a good accompaniment to cold meats and would make an excellent snack if served with black bread.
===Variations===
A few chopped spring onions add a different colour and an interesting flavour.
===Chef's notes===
The peppers should in theory be the long ones, but if unavailable use the normal ones.

If you followed the instructions here to roast the peppers, once de-seeded and torn into pieces, pat them dry with a paper towel, add a few tablespoons of the dressing, close the box and give it a good shake.  This gives the peppers a really good coating of the dressing.
