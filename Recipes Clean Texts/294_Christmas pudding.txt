The Judge 


This recipe is based on that of a pudding made in 1714 for George I when he celebrated his first Christmas as King of England.  I used a 5 inch spherical pudding tin to cook it in.

===Ingredients===
| 80g plain flour, sieved with:
| 0.75 teaspoon baking powder
| 1 teaspoon mixed spice
| 0.75 teaspoon salt

then:

| 80g ground almonds
| 80g Muscovado sugar
| 80g breadcrumbs
| 120g shredded beef or vegetable suet
| Â½ nutmeg, grated
| 130g prunes, stoned and chopped
| 40g dried dates, stoned and chopped
| 80g raisins
| 80g sultanas
| 80g currants
| 80g mixed peel
| 40g glac\u00e9 cherries, chopped and rolled in a little flour or 40g dried cranberries
| 2 eggs, thoroughly beaten
| 100ml stout
| 85ml brandy
| Zest of a small lemon
===Method===


| Mix the dry ingredients,  fruit and liquids separately, then mix all three together.
| Leave to stand overnight in a cool place.
| Add the mixture to a pudding basin, cover with greaseproof paper and then muslin.
| Boil in a saucepan on a metal ring for 6 hours, ensuring that the water level is about half way up the side of the basin.
| On Christmas Day, boil for a further 2 hours.
===Serving suggestions===
Serve with brandy/rum butter or sauce.
===Chef's notes===
*I like to soak the dried fruit (except for the cherries) overnight in the brandy and stout first.
*It is easier to chop the glac\u00e9 cherries with scissors, rather than a knife.
*Every so often, pierce the pudding with a skewer and feed it with more brandy.
