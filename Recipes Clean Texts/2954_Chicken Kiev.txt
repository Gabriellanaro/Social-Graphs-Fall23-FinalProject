Chicken Kiev was invented in the Moscow Merchants' Club in the early 20th century and gained its name because it was cooked in the Ukrainian style.

===Ingredients===
| 4 x 175g chicken breasts, skin removed
| Garlic to taste, finely chopped 
| Salt and freshly ground black pepper
| 1 tablespoon chopped fresh chives
| 230g softish butter
| 2 tablespoons plain flour
| 1 egg, beaten 
| 12 tablespoons fresh breadcrumbs
| Olive oil, for frying


===Mise en place===
* Preheat the oven to  204\u00b0 C (400\u00b0 F - Gas 6)
===Method===


| Slice a piece out of the centre of the chicken breast to make a pocket using a sharp knife. 
| Place the garlic, salt and pepper, chives and butter into a bowl and mix well. 
| Stuff this mixture into the pocket in the chicken breasts.
| Dredge the chicken breasts in the flour, then dip into the beaten egg, then the breadcrumbs to coat completely.
