A type of flat omelette from Azerbaijan, with a copious quantity of vegetables and herbs.   

This sounds amazing!

===Ingredients===
| 500 g spinach, chopped
| 500 g spring onions, finely sliced
| 5 bulbs garlic, preferably with green shoots, finely diced
| 500 g fresh, mixed, green herbs, eg parsley, coriander, mint
| 6 eggs, thoroughly beaten
| 3 tablespoons milk
| 100 g butter
| 250 ml sour cream
===Method===


| Mix the milk with the egg.
| Melt the butter in a frying pan and fry the chopped vegetables and herbs individually until they are soft.
| Add them to the egg and milk mixture and return to the frying pan.
| Cook the omelette on both sides until the eggs have just set.
| Transfer to a large plate, cut and serve with the sour cream.
===Variations===
Spring greens would make an excellent substitute for spinach, but you would need to use a smaller quantity.
