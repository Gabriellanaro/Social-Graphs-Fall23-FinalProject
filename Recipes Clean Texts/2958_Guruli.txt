===Serving suggestions===
Serve with vegetables
===Variations===
Making this for two people (with leftovers) I modified the recipe, below, to suit our tastes.  The result was very nice recipe, despite not having garlic or chillies!
* 8 Chicken thighs on the bone, skin removed and deep slashes cut into the flesh to shorten cooking time and absorb more flavours
* Only 4 cloves
* 1/2 a teaspoon of salt
* 1/2 a teaspoon of cinnamon
* 3 teaspoons of paprika powder
I added about 120 ml of chicken stock as I though it would be too dry.  In the event it would have been fine without.
===Chef's notes===
You can use a whole chicken for the meat, so long as you have the correct quantity of chicken pieces to make the recipe.
