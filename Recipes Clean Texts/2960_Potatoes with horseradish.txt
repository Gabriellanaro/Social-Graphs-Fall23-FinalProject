Almost as good as mustard mash

A nice side dish or vegetable accompaniment.  Also a good use for that bottle of horseradish cream sitting in the back of the fridge.

You could use bottled horseradish cream, though I would think you would need more compared to fresh horseradish.

===Ingredients===
| 500g (1 lb) potatoes, peeled.
| 3 tablespoons grated horseradish
| sea salt
| Dill leaves, chopped
| 50 ml Soured cream or yogurt
===Method===


| Boil the potatoes until just tender. Skewer with a sharp knife for an even texture all the way through, chop coarsely
| Add the chopped dill, horseradish to the cream and mix well
| Stir in the potato pieces and mix well
