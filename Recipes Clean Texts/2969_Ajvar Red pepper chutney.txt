===Description===

This Serbian recipe is not a chutney in the Anglo-Indian sense, but can be served in the same manner, or used as a dip.
===Ingredients===

| 2kg red peppers, skinned and seeds removes
| 20ml red wine vinegar
| 100ml olive oil
| Salt and pepper

===Method===


| Once you have removed the skins leave the peppers to drain for a couple of hours
| Put all of the ingredients in a saucepan, bring to the boil and simmer for at least 1 hour, or more
| Blend, but you don't want it to be totally smooth
| Check seasoning
| Leave to cool
| If not using straight away, you can transfer to sterilised jars and pour a little melted butter over the top to seal
===Variations===
Sometimes, aubergines are cooked in with the peppers
===Chef's notes===
Lard is traditionally used to seal the mixture in the jars, but obviously that is not very vegetarian!
