| Seasoning
| Coriander sprigs, to garnish
| 8-12 cos lettuce leaves and lemon wedges, to serve
===Method===


| In a large saucepan, boil the octopus or squid in salted water for 20-25 minutes, or until just soft.
| Strain and leave to cool before covering and chilling for 45 minutes.
| Cut the tentacles from the body and head, then chop all the flesh into even pieces, slicing along the thick part of the tentacles following the direction of the suckers.
| In a bowl, combine the olive oil and the lemon juice.
| Add the parsley, olives, shallots, onion and octopus to the bowl.
| Season to taste and toss well.
