===Description===

This is made in a similar fashion to English and French terrines, but without the hassle of compacting the meat once it is out of the oven.  In the cyrillic alphabet, this spelt 'векница од меса'.

===Ingredients===
| 8 smoked streaky, rindless bacon slices
| 2 lean bacon slices, diced
| 1 onion , finely chopped
| Garlic cloves, to taste, crushed
| 115 g fresh breadcrumbs
| 90 ml milk
| 450 g lean minced beef
| 450 g lean minced pork
| ½ teaspoon chopped fresh thyme
| 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
| 2 eggs, beaten
| Seasoning


===Mise en place===
* Preheat the oven to 200\u00b0 C (400\u00b0 F - gas 6), [fan oven 180\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]
===Method===


| Butter a 1.75 litre loaf tin and line it with the slices of streaky bacon.
| Stretch the slices with the back of a knife, if necessary, to completely fill the tin.
| Fry the diced bacon in a large frying pan until almost crisp.
| Stir in the onion and garlic and fry for a further 2\u00963 minutes until they are soft and a pale golden brown.
| In a large bowl soak the breadcrumbs in the milk for 5 minutes, or until all the milk is absorbed.
| Add the minced meats, bacon, onion, garlic, herbs and eggs to the breadcrumbs.
| Season and mix well.
| Spoon the mixture into the loaf tin.
| Level the top and cover the tin with foil.
| Bake for about 1½ hours.
| Turn out and serve in slices.
===Serving suggestions===
Serve with herby, mashed potatoes and carrots.
===Chef's notes===
I would suggest you bash the streaky bacon with a meat mallet first.

Follow the RSPCA Think Pig Checklist to make sure that your pork has come from pigs that have been reared to higher welfare standards.
