===Description===

An alternative version of Ajo Blanco Malague\u00f1o, an uncooked, chilled garlic soup.  It is heavenly!
===Ingredients===TM
| 150 g almonds, skinned
| 1 kg Conference pears, peeled, cored and roughly chopped
| Garlic to taste, peeled - I used 4 cloves, although I feel it could take more
| 110g olive oil
| 25ml sherry vinegar
| 2g (\u00bc tsp) sea salt (you may need less if using stock)
| 175g water or vegetable stock
====For garnishing====
===Ingredients===NB
| Fresh parsley, blanched for 15 seconds, put into iced water, then patted dry
| Olive oil
| 4 tablespoons of Pine nuts, toasted

===Method===


| Add the almonds, pears, garlic, olive oil, sherry vinegar, half the salt and water or stock into the bowl '''1 minute / Speed 5-7-9'''
| Check for seasoning and add more, salt, vinegar and oil if necessary
| If the soup is too thick, thin down with a little more water or stock
| Blend again '''10 seconds / Speed 5'''
| Chill for a minimum of 1 hour
| Meanwhile, make parsley oil by blending 1 part (by volume) to 3 parts olive oil (also by volume) until you have a green sauce '''1 minute / Speed 5-7-9'''.  If you are only making a small amount, it would be best to use a stick blender.
| Once the soup has chilled, drizzle a little of the parsley oil over it and sprinkle a few pine nuts on the top
===Serving suggestions===
Serve with crusty bread
