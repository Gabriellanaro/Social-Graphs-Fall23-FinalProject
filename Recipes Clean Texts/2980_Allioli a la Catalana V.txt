===Description===

Allioli is the traditional Spanish garlic sauce.

This recipe is for the traditional hand-made allioli (Garlic mayonnaise).  If you don't have 20 minutes of mortar and pestle time available, you might want to take the short-cut and try our garlic sauce recipe that uses an electric mixer.  However if you have the time and need some therapy, read on

===Ingredients===
| 4 garlic cloves, peeled
| A pinch of sea salt
| ½ teaspoon of fresh lemon juice from ¼ of a large lemon
| 1.5 cups of Spanish extra virgin olive oil
===Method===


| Add the salt and garlic cloves to a large round mortar and smash the cloves into a smooth paste
| Add the lemon juice to the garlic paste
| Then, drop-by-drop, add the olive oil, crushing the paste, turning the mortar as you go
| Don't add the next drops of olive oil until the last have been completely amalgamated into the paste
| After about 20 minutes you should have a sauce the consistency of a very thick mayonnaise.
| If it is too thick, you can add a drop or two of water to thin it out
===Servings===
This recipe makes 1 cup of alliloli
===Chef's notes===
Don't add the oil too quickly.
