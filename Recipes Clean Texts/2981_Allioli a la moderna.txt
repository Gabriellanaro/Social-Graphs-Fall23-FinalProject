The cheat's way to make allioli (Garlic mayonnaise) using an electric hand mixer or a food processor with a metal blade attachment.

If you have the time and want to try the authentic method using a pestle and mortar, we have the recipe for Allioli a la Catalana

===Ingredients===
| 1 small free range egg
| 1 cup Spanish extra virgin olive oil
| 3 Cloves of Garlic, peeled and crushed
| 1 teaspoon sherry vinegar or fresh lemon juice
| sea salt to taste
===Method===


| Break the egg into a small mixing bowl
| Add 2 tablespoons of olive oil, the crushed garlic cloves and the vinegar or lemon juice
| If using a food processor, tip the contents of the bowl into the food processor 
| At full-speed, mix until the garlic is combined into a paste
| Little by little (don't rush this stage), add the olive oil whilst blending at high speed
| Add salt to taste - but not too much. My first attempt was ruined because it was too salty.
===Chef's notes===
If the allioli is too thick, add a teaspoon of water to loosen it.

It will probably be too runny if you use a large egg, so if you have no choice of size, use less of the white.  You can always add more if needed; you can't take it out afterwards though!

This can also be made in a food processor with a blade attachment.

If you add the olive oil too quickly and the mixture separates into an oily mess, try the rescue method recommended by the award-winning Spanish chef, Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s: \"Measure out 1 tablespoon of lukewarm water and add to the mix little by little until you have the creamy sauce you wanted\".

Having tried the above suggestion a few times to no avail, I would suggest adding another whole fresh egg into the split mixture, maybe a dash of nice vinegar and just blitz for a minute or so.  You'll hear the difference as the curdled mixture starts to coagulate properly.  This ''fix'' has worked for me, every time.
