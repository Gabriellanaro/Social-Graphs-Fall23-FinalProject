Almogrote is a delicious cheese paste that is a speciality of  La Gomera in the Canary Islands.  It is traditionally made with Queso de la Gomera, an unpasteurised goats\u2019 cheese, which may be difficult to source outside of the Canaries.  TuCanarias can supply Queso de la Gomera though the postage costs may be prohibitive.

The word \"Almogrote\" does not even appear in Spanish dictionaries, although it is probably derived from the word \"almodrote\": a sauce made from oil, garlic and other ingredients. Almogrote is always made using a mortar and pestle - a basic wooden mortar and pestle.

===Ingredients===
| 500 g mature goats cheese
| 4 tablespoons of paprika
| 1 whole red chilli pepper with seeds
| 1 cup of olive oil
| 10 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed
| 300g tomatoes, (optional)
===Method===


| Chop the ingredients into small pieces
| Grind the pieces to a paste using a large wooden mortar and pestle.
===Type of cheese to use===
Originally, in a discussion with another editor, the oft-seen suggestion to use a 'hard' cheese for this recipe was possibly attributed to a (mis)-translation \"Sometimes the Spanish word 'duro' which means 'hard' can also mean 'mature' in cheese terms\", however the following quote was found:

''Si hace falta martillo y escoplo para ello, el queso es el ideal'', [If you need a hammer and chisel for it, the cheese is the ideal (one)].

So the plot thickens!  If you can shed any further light on this quandary then please do add your thoughts to this, or the discussion page.
