===Description===


This thick sauce originates from the Canary Islands and in particular the small island of Gomera.  It is traditional to use a cheese such as a mature La Gomera, but any strong, hard cheese will be fine.

'''To roast the tomatoes'''
===Ingredients===TM
| 6 ripe tomatoes (about 425g), cut in half
| 4 tablespoons olive oil
| sea salt or pink Himalayan rock salt
'''To make the almogrote'''
===Ingredients===NB
| 8 large cloves garlic, peeled
| 1-2 guindilla peppers
| 140g hard, mature, strong cheese, broken into chunks
| The roasted tomatoes, drained (reserve the oil)
| 90g stock of your choice
| The reserved olive oil, made up to 120ml
===Mise en place===
* Preheat the oven to its highest setting.
===Method===


| Arrange the tomatoes in a roasting tin, cut side up.
| Drizzle the oil over them and lightly sprinkle with the salt.
| Place in the oven for 15 minutes, reduce the heat to 150\u00b0 C (300\u00b0 F - gas 2), [fan oven 130\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour] and continue roasting for a further 1Â½ hours, by which time the tomatoes should have shrunk to half their original size.
| Allow the tomatoes to cool thoroughly or even leave them in the fridge overnight.
| Place the garlic, and guindilla(s) in the TM bowl and process '''10 seconds / Speed 5'''.
| Scrape down the inside of the bowl and add the cheese.
| Process '''1 minute / Speed 5-10 progressively'''.
| Add the tomatoes and the stock and blend at '''Speed 5''' until you have the consistency of a paste.
| Ensure the '''MC''' has open end upright and slowly pour the oil onto the lid of bowl, running at '''Speed 5''' until all the oil has been emulsified.
| Continue blending until you have the desired consistency - I like mine with a bit of texture although you can make it as smooth as you like.
===Serving suggestions===
Serve with boiled potatoes or papas arrugados, hard boiled eggs or simply spread it on bread or toast.  It can also be used as a dip.
===Recipe source===
* The recipe is based on one in '''''Canarias - cocina tradicional''''' by Vicente Sanchez Ara\u00f1a (ISBN 9788444120157).  It has been translated, adapted and converted for Thermomix.
===Chef's notes===
I doubled the ingredients listed in the original recipe, because I am a pig.  Also the roasting of the tomatoes was my idea, to add extra flavour, but there is no need to do so.
