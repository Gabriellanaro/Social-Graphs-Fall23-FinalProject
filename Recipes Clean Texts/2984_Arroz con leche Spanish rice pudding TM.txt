===Description===

A popular Thermomix rice pudding recipe from Spain.
===Ingredients===TM
| 1.4 kg full fat milk
| 200g paella or other short-grained rice
| The grated zest of 1 lemon
| 2 cinnamon sticks
| 150g sugar
| 70g unsalted butter
| Powdered cinnamon

===Method===


| Put all of the ingredients (except for the sugar, butter and powdered cinnamon into the bowl '''45 minutes / 90\u00b0C / Speed 1 / Reverse blade'''

| Pour into bowls and leave to cool
| Sprinkle with the powdered cinnamon
===Serving suggestions===
This is normally served at room temperature.  However, if you wish to eat it straight away, I would reduce the milk quantity to 1.2kg
===Recipe source===

* Based on a recipe in '''Thermomix TM31: Imprescindible para tu Cocina'''
===Chef's notes===
The original recipe contains a lot more sugar to suit the Spanish sweet tooth, but you will find the above quantity to give sufficient sweetness.
