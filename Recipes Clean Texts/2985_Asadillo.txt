A simple but delicious dish from La Mancha made with peppers and tomatoes.

===Ingredients===
| 6 tablespoons olive oil
| Garlic to taste, chopped
| 4 large sweet red peppers, roasted, skins and seeds removed and cut into strips (See Chef's notes below)
| 4 large, firm tomatoes, sliced
| 2 teaspoons oregano
| Seasoning


===Mise en place===
* Preheat the oven to 230\u00b0 C (450\u00b0 F - gas 8)
===Method===


| Grease a shallow baking dish or casserole with some of the oil.
| Using a little more oil, gently saut\u00e9 the garlic until barely golden, reserving the oil.
| Arrange a layer of peppers on the bottom of the baking dish.
| Sprinkle some of the garlic over the peppers and follow this with a layer of tomatoes, seasoning between the layers.
| Continue layering until you have used up the ingredients.
| Pour the remaining oil and the oil in which you saut\u00e9ed the garlic over the vegetables and sprinkle with the oregano.
| Bake for about 20-25 minutes.
===Serving suggestions===
Serve with bread to mop up the juices.  Can be served hot or cold.
===Chef's notes===
To roast and remove the skins from peppers please follow these instructions.  

You can buy preserved roasted and de-skinned peppers in jars.  Some are good and others not so.  If you decide to opt for Pimientos del Piquillo de Lodosa, you will need to use quite a few as they are very small.  Sadly, they are rather expensive if bought in the UK.
