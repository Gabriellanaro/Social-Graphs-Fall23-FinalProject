===Description===

These are asparagus stalks which have been rolled in cheese and ham and bakes in the oven.

===Ingredients===TM
| 150g Parmesan cheese
| 500g water
| 12 thin green asparagus stalks
| 12 slices cheese [This cheese has to be rolled so choose a traditional Dutch or Swiss cheese and slice thinly]
| 12 slices York ham
| Salt
| Pepper
'''For the sauce'''
* 800g milk
* 80g flour
* 50g butter
* 30g olive oil
* Salt
* Pepper
* Nutmeg

===Method===


| Grate the Parmesan  '''30 seconds / Speed 5-7-9'''
| Remove from the bowl and reserve.
| Wash the asparagus and dispose of the hard part.
| Place them in the Varoma bowl and reserve.
| Put the water in the bowl '''5 minutes / Temp. Varoma / Speed 2'''.
| After this time, remove the MC and put the Varoma bowl on top of the lid '''15 minutes / Temp. Varoma / Speed 2'''.
| Check that the asparagus is just cooked; if it is not, cook for a few more minutes at the same temperature and speed.
| Make the rolls by placing a slice of cheese on each ham slice and putting them on top of each asparagus stalk.
| Wrap them into rolls and place in a baking dish.
| Place all of the sauce ingredients into the bowl '''8 minutes /  90\u00b0 / Speed 4'''.
| Pour the sauce over the asparagus and sprinkle with the grated cheese.
| Bake in a preheated oven at 180\u00b0 C (350\u00b0 F - gas 4), [fan oven 160\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour] for 10 minutes, until golden.
