This is not traditionally Spanish but Michael's recipe and he likes messing about with Spanish ingredients.

===Ingredients===
| Olive oil
| 4 medium potatoes, cut like small chips
| 3 medium carrots, cut like small chips
| 1 large onion finely chopped
| 2 tablespoons peeled garlic, cubed
| 4 sticks celery, sliced
| 10 rashers middle bacon, chopped rustically
| 2 cooking chorizos, chopped
| 1 heaped tablespoon hot smoked paprika
| 1 tablespoon chilli flakes
| 2 tins chopped tomatoes
| 100 g garden peas
===Method===


| Heat some olive oil and add the vegetables.  
| Fry for a few minutes under a gentle heat.
| Add the bacon and chorizo and fry until they are sizzling.
| Add the paprika, chilli flakes and peas with the tinned tomatoes and stew until the potatoes and carrots are cooked.  The carrots and celery should still be slightly crunchy.
