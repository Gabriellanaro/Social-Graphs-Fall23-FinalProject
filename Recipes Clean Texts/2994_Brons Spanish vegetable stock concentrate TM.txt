Step-by-step video

You can make your own vegetable stock concentrate in your Thermomix and it keeps for several months if stored in a Lock&lock box in the fridge.  This version is particularly popular in Spain.

===Ingredients===TM
| garlic to taste, peeled
| A handful flat parsley
| 2 carrots, peeled
| 1 12cm piece of thick mooli, peeled
| 1 parsnip, peeled
| 1 stick celery including leafy part
| 2 leeks
| 1 onion (The total of the above should weigh about 820g)
| 200g salt
| 20g olive oil
===Method===


| Chop the vegetables into chunks, place them into the TM bowl and blitz progressively from '''Speed 7-10''' until the vegetables are vary finely chopped.
| Add the salt and the olive oil and and set '''30 mins/100\u00ba/Speed 2Â½'''.
| Then blitz progressively from '''Speed 7-10/30 seconds'''. 
| Store in the fridge in a jar or Lock&lock box.

===Chef's notes===
I use about 4 tsps of concentrate to 1 litre of liquid, but you may wish to adjust according to your taste.  

The salt quantity may appear to be massive, but because you only use small amounts at a time, it will not taste over salty.
