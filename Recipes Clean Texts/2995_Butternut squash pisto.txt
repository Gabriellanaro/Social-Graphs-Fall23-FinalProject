===Description===

Pisto is the Spanish equivalent of ratatouille.  This vegetarian pesto is made with butternut squash, always available at this festive time of year.

===Ingredients===

| 1.2 kg butternut squash, peeled and chopped into 2cm pieces - about 800g once prepared
| 1 teaspoon of Old India Taco Seasoning
| 6 tablespoons olive oil
| A good pinch of freshly ground black pepper
| 3 medium onions, peeled and chopped
| 1 red pepper, deseeded, halved and cut into rings
| 2 green indian chillies, thinly sliced, deseeded if you wish
| 1 large sprig of rosemary, left whole
| 4 freshly picked bay leaves
| 3 cloves of garlic, peeled and thinly sliced
| 1 teaspoon Mexican oregano
| A pinch of cumin seeds
| A pinch of freshly grated nutmeg
| 180ml passata
| 1 tablespoon port
| 1 tablespoon sherry vinegar
''' to garnish'''
===Ingredients===NB
| 2 tablespoons pine nuts

===Method===


| Pop the butternut squash chunks into a sieve and dust with the Old India Taco Seasoning, set to one side.
| Add the freshly ground black pepper to a large frying pan or even a wok.
| Add the olive oil and gently saut\u00e9 the onions for 15 minutes.
| Add the sliced red pepper and fry for 10 minutes.
| Now to liven it up; add the sliced chillies, cumin seeds, bay leaves, whole sprig of rosemary and finally the garlic slices.  Stir-fry these for a few minutes.
| Give the sieve of butternut squash a shake to remove any liquid that may have leached out and add the squash to the pan.
| Very gently saut\u00e9 the squash for 20 minutes, turning regularly.
| After 20 minutes add the passata, port, sherry vinegar, Mexican oregano, and a grate of nutmeg and heat for the final 10 minutes.
| Remove the stem of the rosemary sprig and serve.
===Serving suggestions===
Serve garnished with toasted pine nuts
===Chef's notes===
If you don't have Old India Taco Seasoning, a pinch of salt and ½ teaspoon of unsmoked Paprika will work just as well.
