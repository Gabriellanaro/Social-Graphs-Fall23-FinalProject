Very Spanish, Julia!

This is a stew made with mixed meat.  My husband and daughter enjoyed this in a restaurant near to the city of Antequera (M\u00e1laga). There are many variations of this recipe so I have tried to re create it as near as I can to that which they ate. The orginal had goat instead of lamb, but it is not easy to come by in the UK.  However, our butcher said he can get it for us.

===Ingredients===
| 45 ml olive oil
| 1 kg potatoes, peeled and cut into slices
| 2 large carrots, peeled and sliced
| 2 large onions, peeled and sliced
| Garlic to taste, diced - we used 2 bulbs
| 1 kg in total of chicken breast, pork tenderloin and shoulder of lamb
| 1 red pepper, chopped
| 1 teaspoon cumin seeds
| 2 tablespoons sweet smoked paprika (Piment\u00f3n de la Vera), or to taste
| A few saffron strands, crushed with a pestle and mortar
| 1 large tomato, skinned
| 1.3 lites (approx) Stock or water
| 200 g long grain rice
| 1 tablespoon breadcrumbs
| 40 g ground almonds
| 125 ml manzanilla or very dry sherry
| Seasoning
| 2 eggs, hard-boiled and cut into slices
| Parsley, chopped
===Method===


| Heat the oil in a large deep pan and saute the potatoes and carrots until they are golden.
| Remove them from the pan and reserve.
| Fry the onions and garlic in the same pan until soft, then add the meats.
| Cook until the meats are sealed.
| Add the pepper and cook for a minute or so then stir in the cumin, paprika and saffron, cooking for a further 30 seconds.
| Mix in the tomato, and return the potatoes and carrots to the pan and add enough hot stock or water to cover.  
| Add more stock or water as needed throughout the cooking process.
| Bring to the boil and simmer until about 15 minutes before you think the meat will be done, then add the rice, breadcrumbs, almonds and sherry. 
| Cover and cook for a further 15 minutes.
| Check seasoning and serve, garnished with the egg slices and parsley.
===Variations===
Some variations use just pork or lamb, but would be a mixture of, for example, heart, liver and flesh.  The version from C\u00f3rdoba uses pork tenderloin, whole chicken pieces, morcilla and chorizo.
===Chef's notes===
Remember to make sure the liquid does not evaporate too much or it will stick to the pan.  It should have a thickish consistency though.  By the way, the verdict was that it is very, very similar to that meal in Antequera!
