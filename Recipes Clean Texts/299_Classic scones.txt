This recipe makes light textured scones which are best eaten warm with butter or cream.  They don't keep that well so freeze any excess.

===Ingredients===
| 225g (8oz) self raising flour
| 55g (2oz) butter cut into small pieces
| 25g (1oz) caster sugar
| 150ml (5fl) oz milk or buttermilk
| pinch of salt


===Mise en place===
* Preheat the oven to 220\u00b0 C (425\u00b0 F - gas 7)
===Method===


| Sift the flour into a mixing bowl, add the salt, butter and sugar
| Rub the butter into the flour then add the milk or buttermilk and mix to make a soft dough.
| This can also be done in a food processor.
| Tip out onto a floured worktop and knead lightly.
| Roll out to 2 cm (Â¾\") thick and them cut into rounds with a 5 cm (2\") pastry cutter.
| Brush the tops of the scones with a little milk.
| Place onto a lightly greased baking tray and bake for 12 to 15 minutes or until they have risen and turned golden.
