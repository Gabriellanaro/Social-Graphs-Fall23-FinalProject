This is a delicious salad that suits those who don't like too much 'green' in their salads - you have to like tomatoes though!

In smaller quantities, this would make a nice starter.

===Ingredients===
| 225 g thinly sliced chorizo sausage 
| 3 large tomatoes cut into bite sized chunks
| A handful of cherry tomatoes
| 2 Cloves of garlic, peeled and crushed
| sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
| Sherry vinegar
| 2  shallots, peeled and sliced or 4 or 5 spring onions, cut on the diagonal
| Extra virgin olive oil
| 100g goats cheese, (one small round)
| A big handful of herbs of your choice
|* try basil, parsley, mint or chervil
| Crusty bread to serve
===Method===


| Add the tomatoes, onions and herbs to a serving bowl
| Divide the chorizo in to two portions.
| Heat a few tablespoons of olive oil in a frying pan, add the Crushed garlic and a grind of black pepper and fry half of the chorizo over a medium heat until crispy - this won't take very long if the chorizo is thinly sliced.
| Once crispy, transfer the chorizo to the serving bowl
| De-glaze the frying pan with a tablespoon or so of sherry vinegar.  Use this to dress the salad and mix well.
| Season to taste
| Crumble the cheese over the salad and serve
