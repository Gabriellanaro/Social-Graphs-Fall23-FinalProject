They were tasty though, and I like the idea of chorizo 'hamburgers'

===Description===


When making this recipe I use the chorizo sausages immediately (as they are so good).  I have not tried drying or preserving them in any way, though I guess it would be possible with this recipe. For this reason, I don't bother to get the casings, I just make the sausages like patties or burgers.

Use these in any recipe that calls for chorizo sausages

===Ingredients===
| 1.5 tablespoons sherry vinegar
| 1 large dried poblano chili, stalk removed
| 4 fresh habanero chillies, stlaks removed or 3 teaspoons hot chili powder
| 675 g (1.5 lb) lean pork (pork fillet is good here) , chopped coarsely
| 1 tablespoon fresh coriander leaves, chopped
| 6 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed
| 1 tablespoon paprika powder or smoked paprika powder if you can find it
| 1 teaspoon freshly ground cinnamon
| Â¼ teaspoon ground cloves
===Method===


| Add the spices, chillies and the vinegar to a small blender attachment and grind to a paste.  A mortar and pestle will do the job, just takes a bit more work!
| Add the pork and the spice paste to a food processor and pulse blend until you have a coarse mix.  Don't overdo this or you will end up with pate which is not what you need
| Roll into sausage shapes or flat patties
| Preheat the oven to 190\u00b0 C (375\u00b0 F - gas 5)
| Cook for 20 minutes on a lightly oiled oven tray
| Verify the meat is cooked properly as it is pork remember
===Serving suggestions===
Serve hot or cold

===Variations===
Adjust the amount of chili to your personal taste.  I like mine quite hot.
