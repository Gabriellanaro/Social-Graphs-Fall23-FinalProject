===Description===

A refreshing, slightly alcoholic drink from Spain.  This is a translation of a recipe in '''''Thermomix TM31 \u2013 Imprescindible para tu cocina''''' which is the book supplied with Spanish TMXs.

===Ingredients===TM
| 6 peeled lemons, pith and pips removed
| 200g sugar
| 2-3 trays of ice cubes
| A dash of vodka, to taste
| A dash of Cava, to taste
===Method===


| Put the first three ingredients in the bowl.
| Program progressively '''Speed 5-10''' [no time given].
| Remove the '''MC''', put the spatula through the lid and move it towards the right and the left, so that the ice falls down into the blades and are crushed.
| Pour in the vodka and Cava, mix with the spatula and serve it in Champagne glasses.
===Chef's notes===
The sugar quantity is to suit Spanish tastes and may well be too sweet for people in the English speaking world
