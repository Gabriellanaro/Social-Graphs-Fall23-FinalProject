===Description===

A courgette soup for making in a Thermomix

===Ingredients===TM
| 30g extra virgin olive oil
| 30g butter
| 150g leeks (white parts only) or onion, cut in rounds
| 1 clove garlic
| 700g courgettes, peeled and chopped
| 700g water or milk
| Salt
| Pepper
| Nutmeg
| 6 quesitos (little cheeses in triangles wrapped in foil such as Dairylea)
| Chopped parsley or chives
===Method===


| Put the oil, butter, leeks and garlic in the bowl '''8 seconds / Speed 5'''.
| [Scrape down the bowl] '''12 minutes / Temp. Varoma / Speed 1'''.
| Add the remaining ingredients, except for the quesitos '''20 minutes / 100\u00b0 / Speed 1''' (if using milk set at '''90\u00b0''').
| Allow to cool a little '''40 seconds / Speed 7'''.
| If necessary, repeat the operation.
| Add the quesitos '''5 minutes / 90\u00b0 / Speed 5'''.
| Correct seasoning if necessary and serve sprinkled with the parsley or chives.
===Chef's notes===
I heated the oil and butter '''8 minutes / Temp. Varoma / Speed Spoon''', then added the leeks and garlic '''20 minutes / Temp. Varoma / Speed Spoon / Reverse Blade / MC'''.  This was to allow them to caramelise properly.  I used 1 bulb of garlic and substituted the cheese triangles with some slices of Ca\u015fcaval.  I also included some Marigold Swiss bouillon powder, but be sparing with it if you are using a salty cheese.
