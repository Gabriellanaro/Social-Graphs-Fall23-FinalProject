Made this with Morrison's King Prawns and it was perfect.

===Description===

The recipe calls for prawns that are suitable for cooking with rice.  Have never heard of these before, but if you go onto your browser and type in `gambas arroceras', you should come up with pictures of them.  However, I am sure that normal prawns will work fine.
