===Description===

A Spanish soup with mussels.

'''For the Varoma basket -'''
===Ingredients===TM
| 1.5kg mussels
| 500g water
'''For the sofrito '''
===Ingredients===NB
| 150g leeks
| 50g olive oil
| 3 cloves garlic, peeled
| 150g crushed tomatoes
| 1 green apple, peeled and chopped
| 1 teaspoon dill, chopped
'''Other ingredients '''
===Ingredients===NB
| 25g biscotes French toast-type things
| 50g anise seeds
| 2 fish stock cubes
| Ground pepper
| 300g of the cooking water from the mussels
'''To garnish '''
===Ingredients===NB
| 12 small cherry tomatoes
| Anise seeds
===Method===


| Clean the mussels under the 'grifo' by rubbing one against the other and place in the Varoma basket.  [Grifo in Spanish means 'tap' and obviously refers to some part of the mussel's anatomy.  I have no idea how to translate this into English, so if anyone is well versed in mussel knowledge, could you give me a word to use please?]
| Put 500g water in the bowl '''7 minutes / Temp. Varoma /Speed 2'''.
| After this time, place the Varoma basket on the TM lid '''12 minutes / Temp. Varoma / Speed 2'''.
| When the time is up, remove the water from the bowl and reserve.
| Remove the all but 12 of the mussels from their shells.  These 12 are used as a garnish and you should remove the beards.
| Wash the leeks, dispose of the green part and chop them.
| Put all of the ingredients for the sofrito in the bowl and set '''10 seconds / Speed 5'''.
| Scrape down the inside of the bowl with the spatula and set '''10 minutes /Temp. Varoma / Speed 1'''.
| When finished, add the mussels, the biscotes, the anise seeds, the stock cubes, the pepper and the water '''1 minute / Speed 9''' so that the ingredients are well ground.
| Pour the soup into individual bowls and garnish with the cherry tomatoes, cut in half, the anis seeds and the reserved mussels arranged around the edge.
