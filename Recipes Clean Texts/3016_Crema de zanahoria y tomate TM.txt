| 500g tomatoes

| 2 leeks
| Â½ MC olive oil
| 1 tablespoon butter
| 1 clove garlic peeled
| 500g water
| 2 chicken stock cubes
| 1 teaspoon basil, chopped

| Peel the carrots and cut them into pieces.
| Clean the leeks, discard the green parts and chop them.
| Put the oil, butter, leeks, carrots, tomatoes and the garlic in the bowl.
| Insert the internal steaming basket to avoid splashing '''3 minutes / 100\u00b0 / Speed 8'''.

| After this time, add the water, stock cubes, basil and pepper '''20 minutes / 100\u00b0 / Speed 1'''.
| When the machine stops, check the texture of the soup; if it is too thick, add a little more water and cook for a few seconds more at the same speed and temperature.
