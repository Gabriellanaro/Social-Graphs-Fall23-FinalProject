===Description===

A simple sous vide recipe.

===Ingredients===

'''For the vinaigrette'''
===Ingredients===NB
| 20g shallots, peeled and finely sliced
| 2 teaspoons wholegrain mustard
| 1 teaspoon clear honey
| 2 teaspoons capers, drained and chopped
| 1 gherkin, finely sliced
| 3 tablespoons grapeseed oil
| 1 tablespoon white wine vinegar
| Seasoning
'''For the cod'''
===Ingredients===NB
| 60g salt
| 1.5 litres cold water
| 1kg waxy potatoes, peeled and cubed into 1cm pieces
| 4 cod fillets, skin removed
| 60g unsalted butter
| Extra salt
| Groundnut oil


===Method===



'''To make the vinaigrette'''

| Place a small saucepan of water over a medium heat
| Bring to the boil and blanch the shallot for 20 seconds
| Drain and tip into a bowl of iced water.
| Drain again and pat dry.
| Combine the remaining ingredients in a bowl.
| Season and whisk thoroughly.
| Add the shallot and keep in the fridge until required - it will keep for up to 1 week.
'''For the cod'''

| Preheat the water bath to 84\u00b0C (''183.2\u00b0F)''.
| Place the potatoes into a sous vide bag and seal.
| Add to the bath and cook for 1\u00bd hours.
| Reduce the temperature to 50\u00b0C, leaving the potatoes in the bath.
| Meanwhile put the salt and water into a bowl to make a brine.
| Add the fish fillets and leave for 20 minutes.
| Rinse, drain and pat dry.
| Vacuum and seal the fish in individual sous vide bags with 15g butter in each.
| Add the fish to the water bath and cook for 20 minutes.
| When the cooking time is up, remove the potatoes from the bag and dress them with the vinaigrette.
| Heat a film of oil in a frying pan to medium high.
| Remove the fish from the bags and pat dry.
| Season with salt.
| Fry just one side of each fillet in the pan for 30 seconds until golden.
| Remove from the pan and serve coloured side up on top of the potatoes.

* Adapted from a recipe in Heston Blumenthal's ''Heston Blumenthal at Home''
===Variations===
Any flaky white fish will be fine.
===Chef's notes===
I used a blowtorch on the fish to finish, but I feel that in this instance, pan frying would give a better appearance.
