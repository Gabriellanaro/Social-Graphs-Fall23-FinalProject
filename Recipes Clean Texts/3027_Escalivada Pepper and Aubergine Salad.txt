===Description===

A Catalonian roast pepper and aubergine salad.  Escalivada means \"cooked in hot ashes\" which is the authentic way to roast the vegetables.  However, not everyone has hot ashes to hand, so the following method uses a grill.

===Ingredients===
| 125 ml olive oil or more
| 4 sweet peppers
| 4 aubergines
| Salt
| Parsley, finely chopped
===Method===

'' see Roasting peppers''

| Grill the peppers and aubergines until the skins are blackened.  Peel.
| Remove the seeds and cut into strips. Place strips in a bowl and sprinkle with salt and allow to cool. 
| Dress the vegetables with olive oil and sprinkle with chopped parsley.
===Serving suggestions===
Traditionally served with grilled meat, it also makes an excellent tapa or first course.
===Variations===
You can use any additional grilled or roasted vegetables you like, especially tomatoes and onions.

You may also wish to add Crushed garlic to the oil.
===Chef's notes===
The pepper and aubergines taste much better if grilled on a barbecue. As fresh peas are only available for a short period of the year, you will probably use frozen ones for this recipe.  Note that the weight given above is for fresh peas, so you should defrost frozen peas, drain and pat dry before weighing.  Also if they are fairly dry, they will cook better in the oil. --JuliaBalbilla 13:58, 6 January 2009 (UTC)
