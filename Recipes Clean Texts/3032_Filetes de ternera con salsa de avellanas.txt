The Judge 

Veal escalopes with hazelnut sauce.

===Ingredients===
| Olive oil
| 4 veal escalopes, weighing about 200 g each and seasoned with salt and pepper
| 2 onions, chopped
| Garlic to taste, crushed
| 2 tomatoes, finely diced
| 100 g hazelnuts, coarsely ground
| 100 ml dry white wine
| 50 ml single cream
===Method===


| Heat a little oil in a frying pan and saut\u00e9 the veal until it is cooked.  Remove and set aside.
| Add the onions and garlic to the oil until the onions are golden.
| Add the tomatoes, hazelnuts and white wine and leave to cook for 15 minutes.
| Return the veal to the pan, add the cream, heat through and serve.
===Variations===
You can substitute almonds for the hazelnuts.
===Chef's notes===
When making a similar version of this recipe (for 2 people), I increased the amount of cream to about 120 ml.  The rest of the pot would only have been throw away and the sauce was crying out for more!
