===Description===


Possibly a weird combination, but my husband gave me a 'Ready, Steady, Cook' type goody bag and this is what I came up up with.

The recipe below is only for one, so increase quantities accordingly for more servings.

===Ingredients===
| Rapeseed oil
| Large pinch Maldon sea salt
| 250g Mayan Gold potatoes, scrubbed and chopped into 2.5cm chunks (see Chef's notes below)
| 130g leeks (cleaned and trimmed weight), cut into 5cm chunks
| 200g red onions, peeled and quartered
| Garlic cloves, to taste, unpeeled
| 1 medium red pepper, cut into quarters
| More oil
| Butter
| 170g cod steaks, lightly dusted in seasoned flour
| 2 teaspoons plain flour
| 1 to 2 teaspoons of hot Piment\u00f3n de Murcia, according to taste 
| 150ml fish or vegetable stock
| 100ml fino sherry


===Mise en place===
* Cover the bottom of a roasting tin with the oil and place in the oven.  
* Preheat the oven to 180\u00b0 C (350\u00b0 F - gas 4).
===Method===


| When the oven has reached the required temperature, add the potatoes, leeks, onions and garlic.
| After 30 minutes, turn the vegetables and add the peppers.
| Roast for a further 15 minutes, then turn the peppers.
| Return to the oven for 15 minutes longer.
| Meanwhile, heat a little oil and butter in a frying pan and fry the fish on a high heat for about a minute each side.
| Remove the fish and reserve.
| Reduce the heat.
| Add the flour and cook it through, stirring constantly for about 4-5 minutes, then add the piment\u00f3n.
| Cook for a further 30 seconds maximum (paprika will turn bitter if over cooked).
| The garlic can be squeezed from its skin over the plate, the skin being discarded. 
| Add the stock and the sherry.
| Cook for 3 minutes or so to reduce the sherry and cook out the alcohol.
| Return the fish to the pan and gently heat through for a few minutes.
| Place the fish in the middle of a plate or serving dish.
| Surround with the vegetables and pour over the sauce.
===Variations===
Use any firm white fish and vary the vegetables if desired.  However, you should bear in mind that different vegetables require different cooking times.
===Chef's notes===
I used Mayan Gold potatoes because they look attractive roasted unpeeled and are generally smallish.  Another good potato to use is Highland Burgundy Red which is also small.  However, use any suitable potato breed you desire, as long as they are chopped up small.

As for garlic, I would recommend very fat cloves.  If yours are not very big, add them at the same time as the peppers.
