===Description===

Gambas al ajillo or Garlic prawns.  This could be a tapas dish, a starter, or if you doubled the amount, a main course.

===Ingredients===
| 450g (1 lb) fresh peeled prawns
| 4 cloves garlic, crushed
| 1 teaspoon hot chili flakes
| 1 teaspoon smoked paprika powder (normal paprika powder will do)
| 4 tablespoons dry sherry
| 3 tablespoons freshly chopped parsley
| Juice of 1 lemon
| Olive oil
| 1 lime, quartered
| Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
===Method===


| Cut each slice down the centre of the back of each prawn.  This will enable you to remove the bitter black 'backbone' and will allow the prawn to  curl open when cooked.
| Add 2 or 3 good glugs of olive oil to a large frying pan over a medium heat
| When the oil is hot, but not smoking, add the garlic and chili flakes and saut\u00e9 for a few minutes so the oil is nicely flavoured. Don't burn the garlic or you will need to start again!
| Turn up the heat and add the sherry, lemon juice, paprika powder and the prawns, stirring until the prawns change colour and curl. This should take about 3 minutes
| Arrange in a bowl and garnish with the chopped parsley
| Season with sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
===Serving suggestions===
Serve with freshly baked bread and lime quarters
[[Image:Boiled chickpeas.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Plain boiled chickpeas are a great way of adding healthy fibre to this dish]]
In a nod towards the recent report that [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-46827426 we are not eating enough lifesaving fibre], we have started to add plain boiled chickpeas to lots of our meals.
This recipe is ideally suited to such an addition.  Just drop a fistfull of cooked chickpeas into the bowl as you serve the garlic prawns.  The bland-nuttiness works extremely well with the garlic oil.
It's worth trying, drained, canned chickpeas would be just as good as freshly cooked chickpeas. 

===Variations===

This can be made will unpeeled prawns or even defrosted frozen king prawns.
