Love the colour and the flavour the prawns get from the chorizo.

[[Image:Gambas y chorizo ingredients.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Simple ingredients]]
This came about because I needed a prawn dish without garlic, which would be the way I would normally cook these.  This was a very quick, simple and colourful tapa.

===Ingredients===
| 350 g raw king prawns, scampi, large shrimp etc.
| 7.5 cm (3\u201d) Chorizo, cut in half and then sliced thinly
| 3 tablespoons brandy
| A little olive oil
| Zest and juice of ½ a lime
| Handful of parsley, chopped finely


===Mise en place===
* Devein the prawns, cutting fairly deeply along the back so they butterfly a little as they cook. 
===Method===


| Add a dash of olive oil to a large heavy based and fry off the chorizo until they release their colourful oil.
| Add the prawns and cook them until they turn pink.
| Add the lime zest and juice.
| Tip in the brandy and shimmy the pan so the brandy catches and the alcohol burns off sprinkle with parsley and serve immediately.
