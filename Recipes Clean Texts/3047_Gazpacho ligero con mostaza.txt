===Description===


Light gazpacho with mustard.  Another good excuse to use your tomato press.

===Ingredients===
| 1 kg ripe tomatoes, peeled
| 4 tender celery leaves, or 1 stick celery
| Garlic, to taste
| Salt and pepper
| 1 teaspoon mustard, or to taste (see Chef's notes below)
| 45 ml olive oil
| 15 ml white wine vinegar
| 1 litre water, light vegetable stock, or freshly pressed tomato juice (shop juice is too heavy)
===Method===


| Place all of the ingredients except the water/stock in a blender and process until smooth.
| Pour into a serving bowl and stir in the water, stock or tomato juice.
| Refrigerate until chilled and garnish with chopped celery leaves.
===Serving suggestions===
Serve, garnished with chopped celery leaves. 
===Chef's notes===
This will keep in the fridge for 1 day, but can be frozen for up to 3 months.

Regarding mustard.  The Spanish have phrases for French, English and wholegrain mustards, so I assume that when they say just 'mustard' that it refers to their everyday variety, which apparently is a classic American style mustard.  They also have a brand called 'Louit' who make various mustards, including a American one which is the bright yellow stuff used for hot dogs.  I have never tried American mustard and understand it is fairly mild.  Personally I would suggest that UK readers try English mustard if you want something with a little more heat than the American variety.  Of course, you can use any mustard you like!  I used ground mustard powder.
