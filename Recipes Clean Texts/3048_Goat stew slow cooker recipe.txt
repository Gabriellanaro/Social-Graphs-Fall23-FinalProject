===Description===

Goat is now increasingly available in particular online from UK farms and from Asian grocery shops.  It is recommend that you cook goat on the bone, even for stews, for better flavour
===Ingredients===

| 1kg goat meat, with bone, chopped into largish chunks (see note below)
| 2 tablespoons mild Piment\u00f3n de La Vera (or other smoked paprika)
| Olive oil
| 4 Spanish onions, sliced
| Garlic, to taste, peeled and chopped
| 1.2 litres hot beef stock
| 500g or more new potatoes, halved
| 250ml red wine
| 2 red peppers, roughly chopped
| 2 large or 4 small courgettes, sliced
| 1 large or 2 small aubergines, chopped
| 15 Black olives
| 80g raisins
| Salt and pepper
| Mint
===Mise en place===

* Rub the goat meat with the Piment\u00f3n de La Vera, place in a bowl, cover and  leave overnight or for 12 hours in the fridge

===Method===


| Whilst the goat is marinating, heat some olive oil in a casserole or frying pan.
| Add the onions and gently fry until caramelised - a pinch each of sugar and salt will help with this.  The longer it takes, the better the flavour.
| Towards the end of the cooking time, add the garlic.
| Pre-heat your slow cooker according to the manufacturer's instructions - about 20 minutes.
| Tip the onion mixture into the slow cooker.
| Using the same pot or pan that you used for the onions, heat a little more olive oil to high.
| Add the goats chunks, a few at a time for just long enough to sear the outside.
| Transfer to the slow cooker and add the hot stock, potatoes and red wine
| Cook on 'high' for 2-3 hours
| Add the peppers, courgettes, aubergines, olives and raisins and cook for a further 2-3 hours
| Season to taste and serve, garnished with chopped mint
===Variations===
You can use any combination of vegetables, but just make sure that any hard ones, eg carrots are added at the beginning
===Chef's notes===
I advise you to get the meat chopped by the supplier, rather than do it yourself, which I understand can be very tricky to get right

You can cook this on 'low' if you like.  I have not tested it, but would suggest a total of 8 hours cooking at least.

If you are not going to be around to add the vegetables half way through cooking, you can put them all in at the beginning.
