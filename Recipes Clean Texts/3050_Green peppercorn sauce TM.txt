===Description===

A Spanish sauce which also includes mushrooms.

'''Sofrito'''
===Ingredients===TM
| 50g butter
| 20g extra virgin olive oil
| 100g onion
| 1 leek (only the white part)
| 1 clove garlic
| 150g mushrooms, blanched in lemon juice
'''For the rest'''
===Ingredients===NB
| 300g single cream
| 1 meat or fish stock cube
| 50g green peppercorns
===Method===


| Put all of the sofrito ingredients into the bowl and chop '''4 seconds / Speed 5'''.
| Next program '''7 minutes / Temp. Varoma / Speed 3½'''.
| Add the cream, the stock cube and 1 teaspoon of the green peppercorns '''10 minutes / 100\u00b0 / Speed 3½'''.
| Add the rest of the peppercorns '''3 minutes / 90\u00b0 / Speed 1'''.
===Serving suggestions===
Serve this sauce with steak, tenderloin, fish etc.
===Recipe source===
* This is a translation of a recipe in '''''Thermomix TM31 - Imprescindible para tu cocina''''' which is the book supplied with Spanish TMXs.
===Variations===
If you want to have pieces of mushroom in the sauce, make the sofrito at '''Speed 1''', instead of '''3½''', or add them after chopping the vegetables. 
===Chef's notes===
Please note that the quantity of peppercorns is very large and you may feel the need to reduce this.  The majority of them are consumed whole, but I had to blitz them due to my husband's forthcoming dental treatment.
