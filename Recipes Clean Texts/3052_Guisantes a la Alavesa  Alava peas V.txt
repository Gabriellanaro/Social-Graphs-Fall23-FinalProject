===Description===

\u00c1lava is situated in the Basque Country and the alavesos are great consumers of peas and beans, which grow in abundance in that area.

===Ingredients===
| 60 ml olive oil
| 3 red peppers, preferably of the thick-skinned and slightly pointed variety, chopped
| 500 g garden peas (without pods)
| 3 peeled tomatoes 
| Garlic, to taste, finely chopped
| Water
| Salt
===Method===


| Heat the oil in a pan.
| Add the peas,  garlic, tomatoes and peppers to the oil.
| Slowly add a few tablespoons of water, cover and increase to maximum heat.  
| Cook for 5 minutes, adding more water as necessary.
| Add salt to taste.
===Serving suggestions===
Can be served cold.
===Chef's notes===
This recipe is traditionally made in an earthenware pot (cazuela).  These are inexpensive to buy, but you must follow seasoning instructions before use.  --JuliaBalbilla 14:44, 6 January 2009 (UTC)
