I dislike hake, but the mushrooms made this bearable.

===Description===


A Thermomix recipe for hake, which I consider to be an under-used fish in the UK.

===Ingredients===TM

| 100g shallots
| Garlic, to taste, peeled 
| 50g extra virgin olive oil
| 150g button mushrooms
| 25g fino sherry or manzanilla
| 25g milk

| 4 hake fillets, weighing about 200g-250g each

===Method===

| Add the mushrooms '''10 seconds / Speed 5 / MC On'''.
| Scrape down the inside of the bowl using the spatula.
| To prepare the Varoma basket for the fish by greasing with a little oil.
| Place the fish in the Varoma.
| Add the sherry, milk, cream, salt and pepper to the bowl.

===Recipe source===
* Translated and lightly adapted from a recipe on the '''[http://www.recetario.es/recetas/filetes-de-merluza-con-salsa-de-setas/276130 Thermomix Espa\u00f1a website]''' (You will need to register and sign in to see the original recipe).
===Variations===
You can you any firm fleshed white fish fillets.
===Chef's notes===
Some parts of the hake were quite thick and they came straight out of a cold fridge.  This resulted in adding 5 minutes to the steaming time, in which case add a little extra milk to the sauce.
