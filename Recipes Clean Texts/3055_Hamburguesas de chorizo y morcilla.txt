[[Image:Skinned chorizo and morcilla.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Skinned chorizo and morcilla]]
I have never come across these burgers either in Spain or in any recipe book, but the ingredients used are very Spanish.

===Ingredients===
| 300 g morcilla
| 300 g cooking chorizo
| 2 eggs, beaten 
| Flour for dusting
| 30ml Olive oil
| 4 cloves of Garlic
| 4 Molletes antequeranos
| 35 ml Allioli a la moderna
| 1 small Lettuce
| A few Tomatoes
===Method===


| Remove the skins from the morcillas and the chorizos and place in a bowl.  You will find that morcilla is easy to skin and retain their shape, whereas chorizo is more difficult to skin and will break up in the process.
| Pulse the morcilla in a food processor, add the chorizo and 1 beaten egg and blend roughly.  Do not allow the mixture to become smooth.
| Put the other beaten egg in a dish and sprinkle some flour on a chopping board.
| Divide the sausage mixture into four and shape into burgers.
| Dip each one into the egg and then coat lightly with the flour.
| Leave to rest in the fridge for at least an hour.
| Peel and lightly smash some garlic cloves and gently cook in olive oil in a frying pan.  Discard the garlic.
| When the burgers have rested, fry them in the pan on a low-medium heat until they are cooked through.
| Meanwhile, slice the molletes in half lengthways.
| Spread the allioli on the lid half.
| When the burgers are ready, place them on the bottom half of the molletes and cover them with the lettuce and the tomato, and finally the lid.
===Variations===
Try barbecuing the burgers, in which case add a little Crushed garlic to the sausage mixture.  You could also use the mixture to make Scotch eggs or meat balls,
===Chef's notes===
I have not specified any seasoning as the sausages are highly seasoned in themselves.  Use either ordinary chorizo or for more spicyness, choose chorizo 'picante'.
