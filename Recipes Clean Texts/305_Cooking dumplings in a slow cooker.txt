===Description===

Can you cook dumplings in a slow cooker?  Yes, of course you can - it's really easy.

They'll need to be cooked in a soup or stew; cook the stew in the slow cooker as you would normally and just add the dumplings to the stew for the last hours and cook with the lid on.

They are very nice but they won't be crispy - you'll need to finish then off under the grill if you want crunchy dumplings.
===Ingredients===

| 75 g shredded suet (Atora, etc)
| 150 g self-raising flour
| Â½ dried mixed herbs (optional)
| 75 g water

===Method===


| Allow the shredded suet to get to room temperature
| Add the dry ingredients to a bowl large enough  to get both you hands in
| Rub the suet into the flour with your fingertips
| Kneading the dough into a soft but not sticky texture, use as much of the water as is needed. You shouldn't need more than 75 g
| Shape the dough into 8 or 9 balls, slightly smaller than a golf ball
| Add them to you slow cooker when your recipe has about an hour of cooking left
| Cook in the slow cooker with the lid on for one hour
