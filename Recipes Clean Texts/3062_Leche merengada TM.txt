===Description===

Literally 'meringued milk' this Spanish drink is frozen first and then broken down again the in Thermomix.

===Ingredients===TM
| 150g sugar
| The rind of 1 lemon
| 1 kg milk
| 2 egg whites
| Cinnamon powder
===Method===


| Tip the sugar into the bowl and pulverise at '''Speed 5-10''' progressively.
| Add the lemon rind and pulverise again at the same speed.
| Add the milk and the egg white.
| Beat for a '''few seconds / Speed 4'''.
| Pour the contents of the bowl into a container and freeze.
| When you want to serve, tip the frozen mixture into the bowl, remove the MC, and put the spatula through the hole in the lid '''Speed 5-10 progressively'''.
| Pour into glasses and sprinkle some ground cinnamon over it.
===Recipe source===
* This is a translation of a recipe in '''''Thermomix TM31 - Imprescindible para tu cocina''''' which is the book supplied with Spanish TMXs.
===Chef's notes===
The sugar quantity is to suit Spanish tastes and may well be too sweet for people in the English speaking world, so I would suggest starting off with about 60-70g.
