===Description===


Another great use for my condiment of the moment, sherry vinegar. The vinegar and the herbs work really well with liver, especially if its not over cooked.

===Ingredients===
| 50 g (2 oz) butter
| 1 onion, peeled and chopped
| 450 g (1 lb) calves liver, washed, rinsed, trimmed and sliced as thinly as you can
| 3 tablespoons chopped parsley
| 3 tablespoons chopped sage
| Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
| 30 ml (2 tablespoons) sherry vinegar - red wine vinegar will do , but it's worth getting sherry vinegar anyway, you won't regret it!
===Method===


| Fry the onions in the butter until soft, about 4 minutes
| Add the liver, sage and half of the parsley and season to taste with salt and pepper
| Fry until browned and tender, but don't overcook it or it will be as tough as old boots. (It's quite ok to eat liver rare)
| Reserve the liver and onions and keep warm
| Deglaze the pan with the sherry vinegar by bringing it to the boil whilst stirring.  Reduce the heat and simmer for a minute
| Pour the hot sherry over the liver and sprinkle with the remaining parsley
===Serving suggestions===

Serve hot
