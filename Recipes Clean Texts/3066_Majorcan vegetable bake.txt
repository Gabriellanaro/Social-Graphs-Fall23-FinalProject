===Description===

[[Image:Majorcan vegetable bake ingredients.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The ingredients]]
Another Gent night contender that would make a nice vegetarian main course or an accompaniment.  I've increased the garlic from a measly 2 cloves in the original recipe to about 6 as I can't imagine any self-respecting Spaniard ever putting just 2 Cloves of garlic in a dish to serve 6 people!

Be bold, vary the vegetables to match what you have lying around at the time.

This was a very nice, and very easy vegetable dish, it will be made again.

===Ingredients===
| 400g can peeled plum tomatoes, chopped
| 1 tablespoon fresh oregano or marjoram, chopped
| 3 tablespoons of olive oil plus a little more to dress the dish with
| 6 fat Cloves of garlic (or to taste), half peeled and crushed, the remaining half peeled and roughly chopped
| 1 aubergine, sliced
| 1 sweet bell pepper of any colour
| 1 large onion, peeled and sliced
| 650g potatoes, peeled and sliced: Desiree, King Edward, Lady Balfour, Maris Piper, Melody etc.
| sea salt and freshly ground black pepper

===Mise en place===
* Preheat the oven to  200\u00b0 C (400\u00b0 F - gas 6), [fan oven 180\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]
===Method===


| Add 1.5  tablespoons of the oil to a pan and sizzle the garlic for a minute and then add the tomatoes, oregano, season and simmer for 10 minutes to reduce a little.
| Toss the aubergine, pepper and onion in the remaining oil, season and arrange in a baking tray and oven roast for 10 minutes.
| Remove from the oven and arrange the potatoes and vegetables in layers.
| Pour over the tomato sauce, add a grind of black pepper and a glug of olive oil. 
| Cover with tin foil and bake for 1 hour, removing the tin-foil half way through.
===Serving suggestions===
Serve with crusty bread.
===Chef's notes===
Never one to resist playing around, I added 1/2 a glass of red wine and a big pinch of chilli flakes to the tomato sauce.

I think that in future I would finish under a grill to really crisp up the potatoes.
