A typical Basque recipe based on bonito (see 'Chef\u2019s notes' below), potatoes and peppers.

===Ingredients===
| Olive oil
| 250 g onion, finely chopped
| Garlic, diced, to taste
| 250 g green peppers, finely chopped
| 1 kg potatoes, peeled and cut into chunks
| Water or fish stock
| 2 bay leaves
| Salt to taste
| 250 g bonito, diced
| 2 Tomatoes, diced (optional)
| Parsley, chopped, to garnish
===Method===


| Heat some olive oil in a deep frying pan and gently saut\u00e9 the onion, garlic, green peppers and potatoes until the onions are soft.
| Cover with sufficient water or fish stock.
| Add the bay leaves and the salt and boil for about 10 minutes.  Top up with more water if necessary.
| Add the bonito and tomatoes if using, and let it simmer for a further 10 minutes
| Sprinkle with chopped parsley and serve.
===Variations===
You can include other small vegetables such as peas and use white wine instead of some of the water or stock.
===Chef's notes===
Bonito is a fish, which is a cross between mackerel and tuna.  The true bonito (which is darkish) is not easily found in the UK so use tuna steaks instead.  The fish sold in tins called \"Bonito del Norte\", whilst excellent is, in fact, white tuna.

Marmitako tastes better when prepared a day in advance.
