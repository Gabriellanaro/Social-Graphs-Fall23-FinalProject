===Description===

Another version of this famous dish from the Basque Country where it is known as Marmita-kua.

===Ingredients===
| 125 ml olive oil
| 2 red onions, thinly sliced
| Garlic to taste, peeled and finely chopped
| 3 large, ripe tomatoes, peeled and chopped
| 1 tablespoon sweet Spanish paprika
| 900 g waxy potatoes, peeled and cut into chunks
| 900 g bonito (use tuna if you cannot get bonito), cut into chunks
| Salt
===Method===


| Heat the oil in a deep pan and fry the onions and garlic until they are lightly golden.
| Add the tomatoes and paprika and stir them for about 30 seconds.
| Stir in the potatoes so that they are coated in the oil and tomatoes.
| Add enough cold water or fish stock to cover and bring slowly to the boil.
| Cover loosely and cook until the potatoes are tender.
| Add the bonito or tuna, bring to the boil, then reduce the heat.
| Cook, still covered, for a further 5 minutes and season to taste.
| Serve in shallow soup plates.
===Serving suggestions===
Serve with country bread.
===Chef's notes===
Do not let the fish cook for more than 6 minutes or it will become tough.
