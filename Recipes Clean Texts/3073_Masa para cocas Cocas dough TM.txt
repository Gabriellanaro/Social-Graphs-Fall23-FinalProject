===Description===

Cocas are a type of pizza from Mallorca and this is the dough recipe made in a Thermomix.

===Ingredients===TM
| 50g extra virgin olive oil
| 100g water
| 50g lard
| 20g fresh bread yeast
| 300g strong flour
| 1 teaspoon salt
| 1 pinch sugar


===Mise en place===
* Preheat the oven to 220\u00b0 C (425\u00b0 F - gas 7), [fan oven 200\u00b0 C]
===Method===


| Place the liquids and the lard into the bowl, and program '''30 secs / 37\u00b0 / Speed 2'''
| Add the yeast, flour, salt and sugar and mix for '''15-20 secs / Speed 6'''
| Roll out the dough with a rolling pin or your hands, until it is very thin and put onto a well greased baking tray.
| If you want to make a vegetable coca, place previously roasted vegetables onto the dough, and bake for 10-12 minutes reducing heat to 200\u00b0 C (400\u00b0 F - gas 6), [fan oven 180\u00b0 C].
===Recipe source===
* This is a translation of a recipe in '''''Thermomix TM31 - Imprescindible para tu cocina''''' which is the book supplied with Spanish TMXs.
===Chef's notes===
If you want to use a sachet of dried yeast, you should mix it with the liquids for some '''10 secs / Speed 4''', before adding the flour.
