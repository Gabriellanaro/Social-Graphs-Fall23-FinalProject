A Spanish Thermomix recipe for mayonnaise

===Ingredients===TM
| 300g olive or sunflower oil
| 1 egg, or 2 yolks
| The juice of Â½ a lemon or 1 tablespoon vinegar
| 25g water
| Salt to taste
===Method===


| Weigh the oil by putting a jug on the lid of the Thermomix, press the scales button and pour in the oil until the display shows 300.
| Put all the ingredients in the bowl, except the oil, and mix '''10 seconds / Speed 4'''.
| With the '''MC''' on the lid, program '''Speed 4''' and pour the oil onto the lid, little by little.
| If the mayonnaise curdles, take it out of the bowl and without washing it add 50g hot water and at '''Speed 5''', incorporate the curdled mixture, little by little.
===Variations===
If you wish, you can use 150g olive oil and 150g sunflower oil.  You can lighten the mayonnaise by adding 100g yogurt, milk or cream.
