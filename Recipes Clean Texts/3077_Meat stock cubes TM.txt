===Description===

Making your own stock concentrate or cubes is very economical and keeps well without the addition of un-natural chemicals.  This is a Spanish version

===Ingredients===TM
| 300g lean meat, cut into pieces (chicken, beef, pork)
| 1 whole tomato
| 300g various vegetables (celery, carrot, onion, leek, garlic etc.)
| 30g red wine
| 1 bay leaf
| 1 Clove bud (optional)
| 300g coarse salt
===Method===


| Put the meat in the bowl to chop it '''10 seconds / Speed 8'''.
| Remove the meat and reserve it.
| Next, tip in the tomato and all of the vegetables and chop '''10 seconds / Speed 6'''.
| Incorporate the meat, wine, bay leaf, clove and salt '''30 minutes / 100\u00b0 / Speed 1'''.
| If, due to the type of salt, meat, etc. that you use, you see a little liquid, program '''5 minutes / Temp. Varoma / Speed 1'''.
| Leave it to cool in the bowl for a few minutes, then blend '''1 minute / Speed 6''' and finally '''1 minute / Speed 10'''.
===Recipe source===
* This is a translation of a recipe in '''''Thermomix TM31 - Imprescindible para tu cocina''''' which is the book supplied with Spanish TMXs.
===Chef's notes===
Keep in a container in the fridge.  Salt is a natural preservative.  When the mixture is cold, you can shape it into a 4cm cylinder, cut it into medallions of 2cm thick and wrap them individually in cling film or tin foil.
