You really can make this at home.  It's fabulous, lovely garlic!

===Description===


While on holiday in Menorca recently, this tapa was eaten on a daily basis!  

Be warned, it is quite filling.  Because of all the lovely garlic and chilli flavoured oil, it tempts you to eat far too much bread. This version is as close as I could get to the best we had while there.  Increase or reduce the garlic and chilli to taste. 1 bulb of garlic would be my personal choice!

Good fresh bread is an essential accompaniment to this dish.

===Ingredients===

| 300g large fresh raw peeled prawns (king prawns)
| 125 ml extra virgin olive oil
| 3 small dried red chillies, such as bird eye chillies
| ½ teaspoon sea salt
| 1 bulb of garlic broken into cloves, peeled and sliced
'''to serve'''
===Ingredients===NB
| A little chopped fresh parsley
| 1 lemon cut into wedges
| Freshly baked brown bread

===Method===


| Heat the oil over a medium heat, in a small pan. Not too hot, burnt garlic is nasty.
| Add \u00bd a teaspoon of salt to the oil and then add the dried chillies and the sliced garlic and let them sizzle.
| The very second you see the garlic take the slightest colour add all of the prawns
| Carefully stir until the prawns turn pink
| Be careful not to overcook the garlic.  You want it soft and juicy, not crisp and dry.
| Pour the contents of the pan into a pre-warmed oven-proof dish, or serve from the pan on a wooden board
===Serving suggestions===
Sprinkle the chopped parsley over the brown bread and serve this tapa with lemon wedges

* A glorious Menorcan holiday
===Variations===
My preference for the chillies is to use 3 large dried Chile de Arbole, cut into small pieces.  This way, the oil gets properly flavoured and you have lots of lovely garlic flavoured chillies to eat - I do like my chillies to have a little bite!
