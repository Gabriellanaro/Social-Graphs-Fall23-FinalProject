===Description===

This is a very quick and easy recipe from Galicia which is known as '''Merluza \u00e1 Galega''' in Galician.
===Ingredients===
| 800g Hake fillets or 4 hake steaks weighing about 200-225g each
| Salt
| 4 large potatoes, peeled and thickly sliced
| 1 medium onion, sliced
| 1 bay leaf
| 4 sprigs parsley
| 120ml olive oil
| 8 or more Cloves of garlic, sliced
| 1 tablespoon sweet paprika
===Method===


| Season the hake with the salt .
| Place the potatoes,  onion,  bay leaves and parsley with some salt in a saucepan and cover with water.
| Boil for about 10 minutes.
| Reduce the heat, add the hake and simmer for a further 10 minutes.
| If using fillets add them a few minutes later as they do not hold together as well as steaks.
| Towards the end of the cooking time, heat the oil and fry the garlic until golden.
| Drain the potatoes, onion and the hake, discarding the bay leaves and parsley and plate up.
| Remove the garlic from the heat immediately and quickly stir in the paprika.
| Pour the garlic sauce over the hake, potatoes and onions.
===Variations===
See our recipe for Merluza a la Gallega (with chorizo) - not authentic though!
Hake can be difficult to find in some parts of the UK, so I would suggest you use cod instead.
===Chef's notes===
As mentioned above, be very careful with fillets or they will distintergrate as they are boneless. Steaks have bones which keep the flesh together better.

I think it is best to use a non-smoked paprika for this dish.  Piment\u00f3n de Murcia is probably the best Spanish variety.
