===Description===

This is a garlicky recipe for hake, based on a recipe in Toby Molenaar's ''Discovering the Art of Mallorcan Cookery'' (ISBN 8427305648)

===Ingredients===
| Olive oil
| 4 hake fillets dredged in seasoned flour
| 1 onion, chopped
| 1 bulb garlic, finely chopped
| 2 cloves garlic, crushed
| 12 almonds, peeled, chopped and lightly toasted in a dry frying pan
| 1 hard-boiled egg, finely chopped
| 1 teaspoon dried oregano, or 1 tablespoon fresh (finely chopped)
| 250 ml warm court bouillon
===Method===


| Heat the oil in a large frying pan and sear the hake fillets on both sides.
| Remove the hake from the pan and reserve.
| Using the same pan, fry the onions until almost soft and add the chopped garlic, making sure it does not burn.
| Add the remaining ingredients, stir, and return the hake to the pan.
| Simmer gently, until the fish is cooked (about 4-5 minutes).
===Serving suggestions===
I served this with thrice cooked chipped potatoes and a side salad.  However, mashed or boiled potatoes would be fine, perhaps with some cooked vegetables.
===Variations===
The original recipe calls for hake steaks, in which case they will take a little longer to cook.  Steaks hold together better because of the bones, but my lot don't like fiddling with bones, so fillets were a better option.

Also use any herbs you like, perhaps tarragon or parsley.
