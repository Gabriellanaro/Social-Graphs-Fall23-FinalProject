 The Judge 
===Description===

This is a variation of Menorcan garlic prawns using monkfish instead of king prawns.
[[Image:Monkfish in garlic and chilli oil ingredients.jpg|thumb|300px|right|This is all you need for a fantastic meal]]

Be warned, it is quite filling.  Because of all the lovely garlic and chilli flavoured oil, it tempts you to eat far too much bread. Increase or reduce the garlic and chilli to taste. 1 bulb of garlic and 3 chillies is my personal choice.

Good fresh ciabatta bread is an essential accompaniment to this dish.

===Ingredients===

| 260 g skinned monkfish tail chopped into bite sized pieces (about the same size as large prawns)
| 125 ml extra virgin olive oil
| A pinch of freshly ground black pepper
| 3 small dried red chillies, such as bird eye chillies
| Â½ teaspoon sea salt
| 1 bulb of garlic broken into cloves, peeled and sliced
| The zest and juice of 1 fresh lime

===Mise en place===
The monkfish tail has just one gelatinous bone down the centre, similar to rock salmon or dogfish.  Running a sharp knife along the bone will separate the meat fairly easily.  Just check that there are no pin-bones left where the fins have been poorly trimmed.

Pop the monkfish chunks into a Lock and Lock box together with the juice and zest of a lime.  Shake well and store in the fridge for at least an hour.
===Method===


| Add a pinch of black pepper and the olive oil to a small pan and heat over a medium flame. Not too hot, burnt garlic is nasty.
| Add \u00bd a teaspoon of salt to the oil and then add the dried chillies and the sliced garlic and let it sizzle.
| Drain the lime juice from the monkfish pieces and discard it. 
| The very second you see the garlic take the slightest colour, carefully add all of the monkfish pieces.
| Cook for 3 minutes being careful not to overcook the garlic.  You want it soft and juicy, not crisp and dry.
| Allow the oil to cool a little, then pour the contents of the pan into a pre-warmed oven-proof dish and serve from the pan on a wooden board
===Serving suggestions===
Sprinkle the chopped thyme over the slices of ciabatta bread and serve this with lemon wedges

* Inspired by a glorious Menorcan holiday
===Variations===
My preference for the chillies is to use 3 large dried Chile de Arbole, cut into small pieces.  This way, the oil gets properly flavoured and you have lots of lovely garlic flavoured chillies to eat - I do like my chillies to have a little bite!
