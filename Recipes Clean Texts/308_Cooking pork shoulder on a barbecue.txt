===Description===

I though I would make an attempt at cooking a large 1kg+ pork shoulder joint on our coal fired barbecue using instant heat bags of barbecue coals.

The venture was very successful, although next time I will cook the pork shoulder even longer by adding some normal coals before the instant heat coals run out.

A bag of instant heat barbecue coals last for about two and a half hours before they 'burn out'
===Ingredients===

| 1kg pork shoulder, skin on and scored with a hobby knife
| 1 tablespoon honey
| 1 tablespoon Taste Sensation Hot Louisiana Barbecue Marinade Flavouring
| 1 tablespoon lime juice
| Good pinch of sea salt
| Good pinch of freshly ground black pepper
| 1 bag instant light BBQ coals
===Mise en place===
* Remove any butchers twine and unroll the joint
* Place the joint in a Lock & Lock box, skin-side down
* Mix the marinade ingredients together and pour over the meat
* Leave for 5 or 6 hours end ensure the meat is well covered
* Reserve any spare marinade
* Light all four corners of the barbecue coals bag
* Leave burning for 20 minutes until the flames die down and the coals are white-hot

===Method===

| Arrange the white hot coals so they  are in a single layer under  the meat
| Place a second rack about 10cm (4\") above the normal rack so the meat is well above the coals
| Close the venys  on your BBQ to ensure a slow burn
| Place the pork shoulder on the second rack, skin-side down
| Cook for 1 hour, then turn the meat over and baste with any remaining marinade
| Keep turning and basting for as long as the coals are hot
| We left our first attmept for 3 hours as the BBQ still had plenty of residual heat
| Remove and serve
