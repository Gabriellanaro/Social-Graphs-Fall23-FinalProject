===Description===

Literally 'white black-pudding', morcilla blanca is a Spanish sausage made without blood.

For this recipe, you do not need a sausage machine or casings.

===Ingredients===
| 300 ml ham stock
| 4 bay leaves
| 70 g Bomba or other Valencian rice
| 1 medium onion, finely diced
| 1 bulb garlic, crushed
| 2 teaspoons dried oregano
| 2 teaspoons sweet Piment\u00f3n de La Vera
| 2 teaspoons hot Piment\u00f3n de La Vera
| Black pepper as desired, ground
| ½ teaspoon cinnamon, ground
| ½ teaspoon cloves, ground
| Nutmeg as desired, grated
| 750 g Gloucester Old Spot belly pork, minced
| 1 tablespoon dry sherry
| 1 egg, beaten
| 1 teaspoon salt (optional \u2013 this depends on the saltiness of your ham stock)
| 3 sheets of butter muslin, measuring at least 70 cm by 50 cm each
===Method===


| Bring the ham stock to the boil with 2 bay leaves and the rice.
| Cover, and allow to simmer gently until the rice has absorbed all of the stock \u2013 around 15-20 minutes.
| Transfer to a bowl, discarding the bay leaves and leave to cool.
| Meanwhile, boil the diced onions for 5 minutes and drain them, transferring the liquid into a large saucepan with the 2 remaining bay leaves.
| Add the onions to the rice, together with the Crushed garlic, the oregano and the spices and mix thoroughly with a fork.
| Using your hands, mix in the belly pork, sherry and beaten egg to the rice mixture.
| Weigh the mixture and divide into three.
| Fold the butter muslin in half lengthways.
| Roll out each portion into a length of about 28 cm and place on the edge of the lengthways side of muslin.
| Roll up as tightly as you can and tie each end as tightly as possible with string.  At one end, loop an extra piece of string through to allow the sausages to hang.
| Tie an extra piece of string around the middle of each roll so that you get a link of two.
| Place on a flat surface, such as a tray or baking tin and put in freezer for 30 minutes.  This will help the morcillas to bond.
| Bring the onion water to the boil and add the morcillas.  Add extra water to cover and salt if necessary,
| Reduce heat and simmer for 30-40 minutes.
| Remove the morcillas from the pan, drain and allow to hang in a cool larder for several hours.
| Release them from the butter muslin and keep in the fridge in a container for up to 4 days.
===Serving suggestions===
The sausages are best sliced and fried, rather than eaten whole, in the same way that an English black-pudding would be used.
===Variations===
You can vary the amount of garlic and spices and use ordinary paprika if you wish.  If you can get it, use the pork of an Ib\u00e9rico breed of pig.  The cloves are quite powerful so you may wish to reduce the quantity.
===Chef's notes===
You need to be very careful when cutting the string and unrolling the morcillas.  Use very sharp, fine scissors (such as embroidery scissors) and unroll very slowly and carefully.  Keep them on a flat surface whilst doing this, or they will break.
