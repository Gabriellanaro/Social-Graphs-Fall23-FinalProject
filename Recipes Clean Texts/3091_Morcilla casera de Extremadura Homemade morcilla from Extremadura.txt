===Description===

A version of morcilla blood sausage from Extremadura.  You will need a Sausage machine to make this.

===Ingredients===
| 3 leaves of swiss chard 
| 200 g hard pork fat 
| 1 sprig of mint 
| Parsley 
| 2 onions 
| 2 red peppers 
| 5 bulbs garlic
| Pig's blood 
| Salt
| Smoked paprika (hot or sweet) 
| Oil 
| Sausage casings

===Method===

| Finely chop and mix together the first 7 ingredients.
| Add the salt and paprika and then the blood and oil, until it is the right consistency to stuff the casings .  
| Stuff according to the instructions of your machine. 
| Simmer gently in water until cooked, being careful that the casings do not split.  Alternatively you can fry them in oil.
===Serving suggestions===
Good with fried onions.  Often seen in Spain served an a small bed of very thin chips.

===Chef's notes===
I would recommend that you practice making normal sausages first, just to get the feel for the correct consistency.
