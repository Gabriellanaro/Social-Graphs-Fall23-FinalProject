An Alcoy speciality.
 

The Judge 

Literally Moors and Christians, this Spanish dish recalls the period when much of Spain was ruled by the Moors and the Spanish attempts to re-gain their territory.  This conflict lasted more than 700 years and culminated in the capture of Granada by the 'Catholic Kings', Isabella and Fernando in 1492.

Moors and Christians festivals are still celebrated each year throughout Spain, but the most famous is that in Alcoy (Alicante).

===Ingredients===
| 300 g black, red or pinto beans
| Water
| 280 g cooking chorizo, whole
| 100 g lean bacon, chopped
| Olive oil
| 1 onion, peeled and chopped
| 8 Cloves garlic, peeled and chopped
| Salt
| Sweet paprika, to taste
| 200 g white rice
===Method===


| Soak the beans in water overnight, and the following day, drain them and place in fresh water with the chorizo and bacon and simmer for two hours. 
| After about an hour, fry the onions and garlic in some olive oil and a little salt and at the last minute add the paprika.  Add to the rice and meats.
| When the beans are done, add the rice and boil gently for 20 minutes.
| Just before serving, remove the chorizo, slice, return to the pan and warm through.
===Variations===
This traditional Spanish dish can vary in many ways depending on the region and the chef.  The chorizo can be substituted for pork chops, but if the stew becomes more fatty, add more paprika and water.  You can also add other meats such as morcilla or serrano ham. 
There is also a Cuban (vegetarian) version called Platillo Moros y Cristianos.
===Chef's notes===
Do cook the chorizo whole and slice at the end.  This will prevent the sausage from disintegrating, but allow it to cook thoroughly.
