===Description===

An easy introduction to molecular gastronomy, powders made from oil have a magic of their own.  You must ensure that you measure the two ingredients by '''volume''' and not by weight.  In general the maltodextrin should be twice the volume of the olive oil

===Ingredients===

| 50ml olive oil
| 100ml Tapioca maltodextrin (also sold as Zorbit or El Bull\u00ed Texturas Malto)

===Method===


| Simply mix the Tapioca maltodextrin gradually with the olive oil
| Pass through a sieve 
| If a more powdery texture is desired, pass through a sieve once more, using a finer mesh
| Store in a container in the fridge until required
===Serving suggestions===
Sprinkle over salad leaves or any ingredient that would normally be dressed in, or drizzled with olive oil.  For the best effect make sure that the surface of the ingredients is as dry as possible
===Variations===
You can use almost any oil you like instead of olive oil
===Chef's notes===
Whilst it is plainly obvious that the addition of a sufficient quantity of starchy powder to oil would necessarily create an oil powder, the magic happens when the powder is put into the mouth.  When you do this, the powder reverts back to the flavour and texture of pure oil.  This is because Tapioca maltodextrin, whilst not fat soluble, ''is'' water soluble, which is why you should only sprinkle it on ingredients which have been patted dry.
