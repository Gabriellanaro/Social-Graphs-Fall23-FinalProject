===Description===

 


An olleta is a type of very thick stew, often made with rice and is typical of the cuisine of the province of Alicante.  This particular recipe originates from the beautiful Valley of Guadalest.

===Ingredients===
| 250 g white beans, which have been soaked overnight
| 400 g kohlrabi or turnips, peeled and chopped
| 250 g pork meat, eg, shank, trotter, ham hocks and pig's ear
| 50 g fatty bacon
| 4 morcillas (preferably the onion based ones, rather than the rice based), whole
| 200 g paella or pudding rice
| 70 ml olive oil
| 4 or more Cloves of garlic, peeled and chopped
| 100 g onions, peeled and chopped
| Pinch of saffron, ground
| Salt
| 1 teaspoon paprika
| 2 litres cold water or ham stock
===Method===


| Place the beans, pork and bacon in a saucepan and pour over the water, cooking over a gentle heat.
| In a separate pan, fry the onions, garlic and kohlrabi or turnips in the oil, adding the paprika at the last minute.
| Pour the mixture into the saucepan containing the pork and beans.
| Cook until the meat is almost tender and add salt to taste.
| Remove the meat from the pan, chop it into pieces, and return them to the pan with the morcillas and the saffron.
| Cook until you are left with about 1 litre of stock.
| Add the rice and cook on a medium heat for about 16-18 minutes until the stock has absorbed the rice.
| Serve, ensuring that each person has a morcilla.
===Variations===
If the idea of trotters and ears is a bit off-putting use any cheapish cut of pork you like.
