===Description===


A light and slightly sweet onion soup

===Ingredients===TM

| 1 litre chicken stock
| Salt
| White pepper
| 500g water

| Remove and reserve.
| Put the oil in the bowl '''5 minutes / Temp. Varoma / Speed 1'''.
| Add the reserved onion '''20 minutes / Temp. Varoma / Reverse Blade / Speed Spoon'''.
| Next, add the stock and the salt '''20 minutes / 100\u00b0 / Reverse Blade / Speed Spoon'''.
| Add the pepper, the 500g water and more salt if necessary '''2 minutes / 100\u00b0 / Reverse Blade / Speed Spoon'''.
| Pour into individual bowls.
| Place in each one a slice of toasted bread and sprinkle the cheese over the top.
| Place in the oven until the cheese has melted and serve immediately.
===Recipe source===
* This is a translation of a recipe in '''''Thermomix TM31 - Imprescindible para tu cocina''''' which is the book supplied with Spanish TMXs.
===Variations===
I made this today with the following differences.  I used 2 tbsps Bron\u0092's vegetable stock instead of chicken stock (no need to add salt).  I didn\u0092t bother gratinating it in the oven as I was only making it for myself, with the remainder going in the freezer.  What I did was to make some cheese on toast under the grill, trimmed it and just plonked it in the soup.
