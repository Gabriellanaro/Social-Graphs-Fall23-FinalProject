===Description===

Simply means 'mixed vegetables' which would be a Spanish first course, although you may wish to make it as an accompaniment.  In Spain, vegetables are usually served as a separate course.
  
This recipe is from the Pais Vasco (Basque) region.

Choose at least 5 or 6 varieties of vegetables from the following, depending on what is in season:
===Ingredients=== 
| 1 cauliflower
| 1 white cabbage
| 4 carrots
| 8 artichoke hearts
| 8 spears white asparagus
| 8 medium potatoes
| 400 g garden peas, shelled
| 200 g broad beans, shelled
| 200 g French beans
| 4 tomatoes
| 2 large leeks
| 2 Swiss chard
Also:
===Ingredients===NB
| Olive oil to taste
| Garlic to taste, chopped
===Method===


| Wash your chosen vegetables and peel if necessary.
| Slice, chop or shred the vegetables as appropriate.
| Boil or steam them in separate saucepans, except for the tomatoes which should be grilled.  As some vegetables take longer than others, you will need to work out which ones need to go on first.
| Towards the end of the cooking time, put some olive oil in a pan and gently fry the garlic until it is golden.
| Drain the vegetables and arrange them separately on a large serving plate, or on four individual plates.
| Drizzle the garlic and oil over the top of the vegetables and serve.
===Variations===
You can bake the potatoes if you wish and arrange the other vegetables around them.

The amount of oil you use will depend on which vegetables you have chosen, eg. potatoes will absorb more oil than peas.

You can use butter instead of oil.
===Chef's notes===
If for some reason, your vegetables become cold, you can heat them gently in the microwave, but do so before you add the oil and garlic.
