===Description===

This bread is made entirely in the Thermomix as it is steam baked in the Varoma.  It is meant for toasting.

The recipe comes from '''[http://www.clubcocinafacil.com/masas-bases/PAN-AL-VAPOR_2489.html ClubCocinaFacil]''' - the recipe below has one more rising than the original.  You can also see a video on their website.  It is in Spanish but you will get the general idea.

See '''Variations''' below for how to convert this recipe for steaming conventionally.

===Ingredients===TM
| 150g water
| 15g fresh or 7g dried yeast
| 250g strong white bread flour
| 1 teaspoon salt
| Oil for greasing
| 1.5 litres water (for the Varoma)
===Method===


| Put the 150g water and the yeast in the bowl 2 minutes / 37\u00ba / Speed 1.
| Add the flour and salt and 2 minutes 30 seconds / Knead.
| Leave to rise in the bowl until almost doubled in size, then 10 seconds / Knead.
| Shape the dough into a ball and put it in an oiled soup bowl which will fit into the Varoma.
| Cover with a tea towel and leave for about an hour until doubled.
| Pour the 1.5 litres of water into the bowl and place the Varoma, containing the soup bowl and dough on top of the TM bowl.
| Cover, and steam for 45 minutes / Temp. Varoma / Speed 1.
| Allow to cool and cut into 1cm slices.
===Serving suggestions===
Makes a wonderful bread for Pa amb tom\u00e0quet (Pa amb oli).
===Variations===
This can also be made in a conventional manner.  Make and knead the dough according to your usual manner and steam in a in a saucepan or steamer on the hob, until it has the appearance of a suet pudding.
===Chef's notes===
This bread will seem to be uncooked, but that is how it is.  It is very good toasted and will last for days.

I steamed mine in an enamel pudding basin, which is fine, but the top of the dough does touch the Varoma lid towards the end of the steaming time, if using a TM31.  The Varoma basket in the TM5 is deeper, so should not touch the lid if using this version.
