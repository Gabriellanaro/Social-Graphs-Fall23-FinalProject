Just needs a bit of cheese with it.
 

The Judge 


Either George Bennell or  Adam Wells writes: \"We first discovered this traditional Catalonian dish when we visited our olive groves. We often go early in the morning just as the sun is coming up to see the olives on the trees. 

Maybe it sounds odd, but with local sausages, some strong black coffee and our beautiful olive groves laid out before us this is a pretty sublime dish - and not one that should be restricted to breakfast. A good olive oil is key - try using our Early Harvest Olive Oil from Catalonia.

Leopold Pomes, author of the Theory and Practice of Bread with Tomato (1984) claims this was invented by a painter who wanted to combine the colours of the sunset on an edible base. It\u0092s more likely this tasty delicacy was created by an inventive Catalan wanting to use up the previous day\u0092s bread.\"

===Ingredients===
| 8 slices of toasted ciabatta or country bread 
| 2 Cloves garlic, peeled and cut in half 
| 2 large ripe tomatoes cut in quarters 
| Belazu Early Harvest extra virgin olive oil 
| sea salt
===Method===


|Take a piece of the toasted ciabatta and rub the cut edge of the garlic over its surface. Then rub the cut side of a tomato quarter over the toast until it softens with the tomato pulp. Drizzle olive oil on top and sprinkle with sea salt. 
|Repeat with the remaining toast and serve.
===Variations===
Garnish with anchovy fillets.
