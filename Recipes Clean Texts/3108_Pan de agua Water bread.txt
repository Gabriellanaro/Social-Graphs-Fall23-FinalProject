===Description===



This recipe is based on one by Xavier Barriga from his book '''Pan''' (ISBN 8425343267).  My version below uses a different method and also requires you to start this the evening before the day you want to bake it.

It is an extremely wet dough (120% hydration) and I would advise you to mix it using a food mixer with a beater or whisk (the mixture is too wet to benefit from using a dough hook).  If you have a Kenwood Chef / Major, the  flexi-beater is ideal.

===Ingredients===
| 10g fresh yeast
| 600g sparkling mineral water
| 500g very strong bread flour, eg Waitrose Very Strong Canadian Bread Flour
| 12g salt
===Method===


| Dissolve the yeast in the water.
| Pour into a bowl and add 250g of the flour.
| Mix well, cover in clingfilm and leave overnight at room temperature.
| The following morning add the remaining flour and the salt.
| Mix for about 5 minutes on the second slowest speed.
| Cover and leave to rest for 2 hours.
| Grease a 900g loaf tin with oil - groundnut oil is best as it has a high smokepoint.
| Pour the dough into it (it should come up to about three-quarters of the tin.
| Allow to prove for 1 hour, covered.
| Meanwhile, place a tray or pan of boiling water in the bottom of the oven.
| Switch on the oven to its highest temperature.
| When the dough has finished proving, sprinkle with flour, put it in the oven and reduce the temperature to 190\u00b0 C (375\u00b0 F - gas 5), [fan oven 170\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour].
| Bake for 60 minutes.
| Once baked, turn out onto a cooling rack and allow to cool.
| If the bread is a little soft on the bottom, turn it over, place on a baking tray and return to the oven for 10 minutes or so until crisp.
===Serving suggestions===
Good toasted and rubbed with garlic, tomato and olive oil.
===Chef's notes===
As this is a wet dough, I would recommend that you line your bread tin with Bake-O-Glide, or something similar.
