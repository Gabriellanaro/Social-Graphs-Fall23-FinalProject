===Description===


This is an adaptation for Thermomix from the recipe by Xavier Barriga from his book '''Pan''' (ISBN 8425343267).

It is an extremely wet dough (120% hydration) but the beauty of this is that it does not require kneading.

===Ingredients===TM
| 600g mineral water
| 10g fresh yeast or 5g dried yeast
| 500g very strong bread flour, eg Waitrose Very Strong Canadian Bread Flour
| 12g salt
===Method===


| Place all of the ingredients, excluding the salt into the TM and process for '''10-15 seconds / Speed 6''' until you have a smooth batter. 
| Leave to rest in the jug for about 2 hours, by which time it should have risen substantially.
| Add the salt and mix for a '''few seconds / Speed 6''' to ensure that the salt is evenly incorporated.
| Grease a 900g loaf tin with oil - groundnut oil is best as it has a high smokepoint.
| Pour the dough into it (it should fill about three-quarters of the tin).
| Allow to prove for 1 hour, covered.
| Meanwhile, place a tray or pan of boiling water in the bottom of the oven.
| Switch on the oven to its highest temperature.
| When the dough has finished proving, sprinkle with flour, put it in the oven and reduce the temperature to 190\u00b0 C (375\u00b0 F - gas 5), [fan oven 170\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour].
| Bake for 60 minutes.
| Once baked, turn out onto a cooling rack and allow to cool.
| If the bread is a little soft on the bottom, turn it over, place on a baking tray and return to the oven for 10 minutes or so until crisp.
===Serving suggestions===
Good toasted and rubbed with garlic, tomato and olive oil. 
===Variations===
A conventional method of making this bread can be found here.
===Chef's notes===
As this is a wet dough and your tin isn't non-stick, I would recommend that you line your bread tin with Bake-O-Glide, or something similar.
