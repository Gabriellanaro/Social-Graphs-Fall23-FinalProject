Only problem is it uses lots of oil.

===Description===

There are many recipes for potatoes with garlic and parsley and this simple version comes from Ja\u00e9n.

===Ingredients===
| 900 g potatoes, cut in Â½ cm slices
| Olive oil - sufficient to just cover the potatoes in a deep pan
| 4 cloves or more of garlic, peeled and roughly chopped 
| Parsley, chopped
| 1 tablespoon sweet smoked paprika
| 1-2 tablespoons white wine vinegar
===Method===


| Heat the oil gently and add the potatoes.
| Allow the potatoes to stew in the oil until cooked.  Do not allow them to go brown.
| Drain off most of the oil, add the garlic and parsley and cook for a further minute or two.
| At the last moment, stir in the paprika and add a splash or two of the white wine vinegar.
| Do not allow the paprika to cook for too long or it will become bitter.
===Serving suggestions===
Serve as a tapa with allioli or with some salad and nice bread.
===Variations===
You can substitute lemon juice for the white wine vinegar.
===Chef's notes===
Add as much or as little garlic, parsley, paprika and wine vinegar as you like.  If you are using a lot of garlic, leave the cloves whole. You will achieve a stronger garlic taste by frying the garlic separately and adding it to the potatoes at the last minute.
