Riojan potatoes are usually served as a tapa, but can be used as a first course or accompaniment.

===Ingredients===
| 1 onion, peeled and chopped
| 1 green pepper, chopped
| Olive oil
| 8 Cloves of garlic, peeled and chopped
| 1 bay leaf
| Salt
| 1 kg waxy new potatoes, washed and chopped 
| 1 kg pork chops, pre cooked, boned and cut into bite size pieces
| 2 cooking chorizos, sliced
| 1 green chilli, chopped (and seeded if desires)
| 2 teaspoons sweet paprika
| Water
| Parsley, chopped (to garnish)
===Method===


| Gently saut\u00e9 the onion and green pepper in some oil, together with the garlic, bay leaf and a little salt.
| Add the potatoes, chops and chorizo.
| Cover with water and add the chilli and paprika.
| Allow to cook gently for about 40 minutes until most of the liquid is absorbed.
| Serve sprinkled with chopped parsley.
===Variations===
Not all recipes include pork so if you wish to leave them out, add some extra chorizo.

For a spicier version, use hot smoked paprika and as usual, you can adjust the amount of garlic.
===Chef's notes===
Try not to let the potatoes over-cook or they will disintegrate.  If you cannot get waxy potatoes, then use others but add them about 10 minutes later than the recipe states.
