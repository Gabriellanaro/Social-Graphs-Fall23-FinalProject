===Description===

Literally 'Turkey with wet rice', ie the rice is cooked together with the other ingredients as opposed to being cooked separately.

This dish is found throughout Spain, where turkey is eaten all year round and not just at Christmas.

===Ingredients===
| 50 ml olive oil
| Salt and pepper
| 800g skinned, chopped turkey breast
| 1 large onion
| 6 Cloves garlic
| 2 medium potatoes, peeled and cubed
| 1 green pepper
| 1 red pepper
| Pinch of saffron, pounded
| 340g long-grain rice
| Juice of 1 lemon
| 1 litre turkey or chicken stock
| Chopped parsley to garnish
===Method===


| Heat the oil in a deep pan.  
| Season the turkey and stir into the oil until browned.
| Remove the turkey and place in a bowl.
| Add the onions and garlic to the same pan until golden and mix with the turkey in the bowl.
| Fry the potatoes until golden and add the peppers and saffron.
| When the peppers have started to brown, add the rice, stir and cook for a further minute.
| Finally, add the stock and lemon, cover, and allow to cook for about 15 minutes, by which time the rice should be cooked.
| Garnish with chopped parsley.
===Serving suggestions===
Like most Spanish dishes, this would be served on its own, but it would go nicely with a side dish of vegetables or salad.
===Variations===
Use chicken in place of turkey if you wish.
