===Description===

Literally 'bread and oil' but also includes tomato and garlic.  It is from Majorca and is eaten at any time of the day.

===Ingredients===
| 1 slice of rustic bread, about 2 cm thick
| 1 clove garlic, cut in half length ways
| 1 ripe tomato, cut in half
| Extra virgin olive oil, to taste
| Salt
===Method===


| Toast the bread until it is golden.
| Rub the garlic over both sides the toast, so that it is actually grated.
| Rub the tomato over one side so that the skin comes away in your hand.  This will only work with a ripe tomato.
| Serve on a plate, drizzle with the oil and add salt to taste.
===Variations===
A similar version comes from Catalu\u00f1a where it is known as '''pa amb tom\u00e0quet'''.  However the Catalans put the oil on before the tomato.  Sometimes, sliced ham is added on the top.

===Chef's notes===
There are some cheat's methods of making this, especially if you cannot get ripe tomatoes.  Firstly, you can grate the tomato finely and spread it over the toast. or try using a tinned plum tomato.  Alternatively, use some tinned chopped tomatoes and drain them off thoroughly beforehand.
