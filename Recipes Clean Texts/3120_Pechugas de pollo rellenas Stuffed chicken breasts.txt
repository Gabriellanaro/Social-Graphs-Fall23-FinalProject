===Description===

Stuffed [https://www.cookipedia.co.uk/cgi-bin/cc.pl?cftk=2#jump chicken breasts] appear frequently on Spanish menus and in their cookery books, and whilst  this recipe (created by my husband) is not necessarily typical, it does have Spanish elements.

Surprisingly though, it does not contain garlic.

===Ingredients===
| 4 plump chicken breasts, skinned and boned
| Olive oil
| 100 g Serrano ham
| Half a green pepper, diced
| 4 medium mushrooms, diced
| 4 spring onions, whites only, diced
| 2 tablespoons piment\u00f3n de la Vera dulce (sweet smoked paprika)
| Cocktail sticks
===Method===


| Soak some cocktail sticks in hot water.
| Slit the chicken breasts in half horizontally, but not completely - see how to butterfly a chicken breast.
| Open the breast and bash with a meat mallet.
| On one side of each of the open breasts, place a slice of Serrano ham and rub a dab of olive oil over the ham.
| Place the diced vegetables on top of the ham.
| Mix the paprika with the remaining olive oil and dab over the vegetables.
| Place a further slice of Serrano ham on top of the vegetables.
| Fold the other half of the chicken breast and using the cocktail sticks pin the open sides together.
| Heat some oil in a shallow pan and gently fry the breasts on both sides until golden.
| Transfer them to a roasting tin and bake in a preheated oven 190 C/375 F/Gas 5 for 25 minutes.  
| Allow to go completely cold, remove the cocktail  sticks and  cut the breasts into 1Â½ cm slices.
===Serving suggestions===
Goes nicely with small new potatoes, and salad.

===Chef's notes===
This is quite a healthy dish, but to make it even healthier, you can put them straight into the oven without searing. Also you can use a rack in the roasting tin.  However, you will need to lengthen the cooking time.
