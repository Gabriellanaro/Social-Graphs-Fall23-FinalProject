But I can never get the lattice-bit right.  All the tools I've tried are hopeless. Help!

===Ingredients===
| 200 g hake
| 200 g peeled frozen prawns 
| 8 piquillo peppers
| 2 sheets of puff pastry
'''For the main sauce'''
* 2 tablespoons flour
* 3 tablespoons warm milk or fish stock or a mixture of both
* 4 tablespoons sunflower oil or butter
* salt
'''For the pepper sauce'''
* 2 piquillo peppers
* 2 tablespoons main sauce
* 200 ml single cream

===Method===


| Simmer the hake and prawns in enough water to cover.
| Once they are cooked, reserve the stock if you are going to use it for the sauce
| Cut the prawns into small cubes and crumble the hake, removing any skin and bones.
| To make the sauce, heat the sunflower oil in a pan and add the flour.
| Cook lightly until the flour is golden brown and add the milk or fish stock, stirring until you have the desired consistency. 
| Remove and reserve two tablespoons of sauce to use for the pepper sauce and season the remainder.
| Mix in the reserved prawns and hake.
| To prepare the pepper sauce, blend two peppers with the cream and the two tablespoons reserved sauce.
| Fill the peppers with the fish mixture.
| Wrap each pepper in puff pastry and using a lattice cutter, cut pieces of pastry to put on top of each wrapped pepper. This can also be done using a sharp knife \u2013 if you have the patience!
| Bake at 200\u00b0 C (400\u00b0 F - gas 6) for 15 minutes, serve with the hot pepper sauce ... and enjoy!
===Variations===
Peeled prawns are used for convenience, but you can use un peeled prawns if you wish and these will give the stock more flavour.

You can flavour the sauce with Crushed garlic or finely chopped onion before adding the flour.
