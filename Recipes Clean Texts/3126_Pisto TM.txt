===Description===

Pisto is the Spanish equivalent of Ratatouille

===Ingredients===TM
| 300g courgettes, peeled
| 150g red peppers
| 150g green peppers
| 300g onions
| 100g extra virgin olive oil
| 500g tinned, chopped tomatoes
| Salt
| Pepper
===Method===


| Once you have prepared the vegetables, put half of them in the bowl in uniform pieces '''4 seconds / Speed 4'''
| Remove and reserve and do the same with the rest of the vegetables
| Next, put the oil and the vegetables into the bowl '''15 minutes / Temp. Varoma / Reverse Blade / Speed Spoon'''
| Incorporate the tomatoes, salt and pepper '''20 minutes / Temp. Varoma / Reverse Blade / Speed Spoon'''
| Adjust seasoning
===Serving suggestions===
Serve with fried eggs or to taste
===Recipe source===
* This is a translation of a recipe in '''''Thermomix TM31 - Imprescindible para tu cocina''''' which is the book supplied with Spanish TMXs
===Chef's notes===
I varied the method slightly and also added 1 bulb of garlic.  Peppers, onions and garlic need a few more seconds chopping. I heated the oil first '''6 minutes / Temp. Varoma / Speed Spoon''' before adding the vegetables.  The weight of the vegetables when I made it are net weight after peeling.  When I was saut\u00e9eing the vegetables in the oil, I left the '''MC off'''.
