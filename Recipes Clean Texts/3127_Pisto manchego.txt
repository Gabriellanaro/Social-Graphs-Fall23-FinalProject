I make this every year to use up the spare courgettes before they turn into marrows and are wasted.

 

The Judge 

This is a stewed vegetable dish from La Mancha and is served as a tapa.

===Ingredients===
| 3 tablespoons olive oil
| 1 sweet pepper, cut into 2cm squares
| 1 medium onion, chopped
| 180g courgettes, cut into 1cm slices and diced into 4.
| Garlic to taste, crushed
| 340g tomatoes, peeled and chopped
| 1 tablespoon parsley, finely chopped
| Seasoning
===Method===


| Heat the oil in a large pan and fry the pepper, onion, courgettes and garlic until the onion has softened.
| Add the remaining ingredients and cook over a low-medium heat, uncovered, for 30 minutes.
| At the end of the cooking time, increase the heat to reduce the liquid. giving you a thick, stew-like consistency.
===Serving suggestions===
It can be served hot, cold or warm and can be made a day in advance.  Nice with fresh, homemade bread.
