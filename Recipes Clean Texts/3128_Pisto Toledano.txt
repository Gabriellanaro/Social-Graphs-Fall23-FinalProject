A chicken stew (lit. hotch-potch) from Toledo.

===Ingredients===
| 3 tablespoons olive oil
| 900 g boneless, skinless, chicken breasts, diced and seasoned with salt and pepper
| 2 medium onions, diced
| Garlic to taste, diced (I used 3 bulbs)
| 4 red peppers, roasted, skins and seeds removed, and coarsely chopped
| 1 teaspoon dried oregano or 3 teaspoons if fresh
| 2 400 g tins chopped tomatoes
| 2 tablespoons white wine vinegar
===Method===


| Heat the oil in a large saucepan to a medium temperature.
| Add the chicken pieces and cook for about 15 minutes to brown them.
| Add the onions and garlic and stew until the onions are beginning to soften - about 5 minutes or so.
| Increase the heat and add the remaining ingredients.
| Cook for about 5 minutes, then reduce the heat to medium-low.
| Continue cooking, uncovered for around 50 minutes, until the chicken pieces are tender.
===Serving suggestions===
Serve with rice or noodles, or on its own as a tapa.
===Variations===
There are many regional variations of pisto using different vegetables such as aubergines, courgettes.  Green bacon, pork tenderloin or fish is often used instead of chicken.  
===Chef's notes===
If you can get nice, ripe, fresh tomatoes, then they are best, but peel them first.

Make sure that the temperature of the oil to which you add the chicken is not too hot or it will stick.
