===Description===


Chicken in garlic 'sauce'.

===Ingredients===
| 4 tablespoons olive oil
| 6 large, boneless chicken breasts, cut into chunks
| Garlic cloves, to taste, peeled and chopped
| 30 ml oloroso sherry
| 1 level teaspoons flour
| 60 ml dry white wine
| 60 ml chicken stock
| Seasoning
| Pinch saffron, ground
| Small amount of chopped parsley
===Method===


| Heat the oil in a pan and saut\u00e9 the chicken until it is golden.
| Drain any excess fat and add the garlic.
| Cook for a few minutes and add the sherry.
| When the sherry has heated through (a minute or so), stir in the flour, ensuring that there are no lumps.
| Add the wine, stock, seasoning and saffron and simmer, covered for about 30 minutes, stirring in the parsley just before the end of the cooking time.
===Serving suggestions===
On its own, with cubes of bread as a tapa or snack or can be part of a main meal.
===Variations===
Use Spanish brandy instead of sherry.  See also pollo al ajillo.
===Chef's notes===
Make sure that the chicken is dry before adding it to the pan or it may not colour.
