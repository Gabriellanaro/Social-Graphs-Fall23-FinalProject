===Description===

[[Image:Guindillas.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Guindilla chillies]]
From Extremadura, the recipe title literally means 'test the pork', and was traditionally prepared to test the meat of a freshly killed pig.

===Ingredients===
| 1 kg fillet of pork, sliced in rounds of about 1 cm thick
| 2 teaspoons sweet piment\u00f3n de La Vera
| Seasoning
| 60 ml olive oil
| 1 large onion, chopped
| 1-2 bulbs garlic, finely diced
| 2-3 guindilla chillies, finely chopped
| A little oregano, chopped
| 1 bay leaf
| 180 ml hot stock or water
| 60 ml sherry or red wine vinegar
| 2-3 tablespoons flat-leaved parsley, finely chopped


===Mise en place===
* Rub the pork with the paprika and seasoning, then leave at room temperature for 1-2 hours.
===Method===


| Heat the oil in a pan until it is very hot.
| Add the pork and when completely seared, add the onion, garlic, chillies, oregano and bay leaf.
| Allow to cook until the onion is soft, stirring the mixture from time to time.
| Add 90 ml of the water and 30 ml of the vinegar.
| Reduce until the liquid has disapeared and add the remaining water and vinegar.
| Allow to reduce further, until the sauce has almost evaporated, ie 1-2 tablespoons of liquid left.
| Serve, garnished with the parsley.
===Variations===
Increase or reduce the garlic and chilli quantities as desired.  Pickled guindilla chilles are available in the UK, but you can use cayenne chillies as an alternative.
