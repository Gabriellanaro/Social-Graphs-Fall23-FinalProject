Beetroot in sherry sauce from Sevilla.

===Ingredients===
| 2 large raw beetroots, unpeeled, with roots intact and stalk trimmed to about 2cm.
| 1 onion, thinly sliced
| 1 tablespoon olive oil
| 1 tablespoon flour
| 225 ml medium sherry
| Seasoning


===Mise en place===
* Boil the beetroots for about an hour and a half, or until just tender.
===Method===


| Heat the oil in a largish pan and gently fry the onions until soft.
| Meanwhile, top and tail the cooked, cooled beetroots and peel carefully. Chop into chunks and reserve.
| Stir the flour into the pan and allow to cook with the onions for 60-90 seconds.
| Remove from the heat and gently add the sherry, stirring constantly.
| Add the beetroot, season, then cover and simmer for about 15 minutes.
===Serving suggestions===
Serve hot, warm, or cold as a tapa or an accompaniment.
===Variations===
Add a pinch of sugar if the sauce is not sweet enough.
===Chef's notes===
Keep an eye on on the sauce whilst it is cooking, in case it evaporates too quickly.
