A member of the gazpacho family, salmorejo is similar to porra antequerana but comes from western Andaluc\u00eda, most notably the province of C\u00f3rdoba. This is another good excuse to use your tomato press.

===Ingredients===
| 1 whole egg, plus one yolk
| 1-2 bulbs garlic, peeled
| 1 litre olive oil
| 380 g bread
| 1.2 kg ripe tomatoes, peeled
| Salt, to taste
===Method===


| In a food processor, or using a stick blender, beat the egg and the yolk.
| Add the garlic cloves and process until the mixture is smooth.
| Add some oil, a little at a time, then some bread and some of the tomatoes.
| Keep repeating this process until all of the ingredients have been used.
| Add salt as desired.
| The salmorejo should have the consistency of soft mayonnaise.
===Serving suggestions===
It is commonly served as a tapa and like porra, is tradtionally accompanied by chopped, hard-boiled egg and Serrano ham.   However, I like to use it as a sauce or a dip.  Also try it in sandwiches instead of mayonnaise.
===Variations===
There are many variations of salmorejo.  You may wish to add a few tablespoons of wine or sherry vinegar.  I used half olive oil and half rapeseed oil - not authentic, but nice.  The garlic quantity can be varied to taste.  Initially I made it with 1 bulb, but you can hardly taste it, so be BRAVE!!
===Chef's notes===
The quantity given is rather large and only just fits in the largest bowl of a Magimix.  I would suggest making half or even a quarter of the volume to start with, unless you have a glut of tomatoes or are addicted to salmorejo.  I have and I am.
