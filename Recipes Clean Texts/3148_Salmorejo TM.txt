===Description===

This is a Thermomix recipe, but a non-Thermomix recipe is available here.  It is normally served as a tapa, particularly in the C\u00f3rdoba province of Spain.  If tomatoes are out of season, I make this with tinned ones.

'''To garnish'''
===Ingredients===TM
| 4 hard-boiled eggs
| 40g Serrano ham
| 1 kg ripe tomatoes
| 2 cloves garlic (or more, taste)
| 20g vinegar (white wine or sherry)
| 110g extra virgin olive oil
| 0.5 teaspoon salt
| 100g breadcrumbs
===Method===

| Put the eggs into the bowl and chop '''2 seconds / Speed 4'''.  Remove and reserve.
| Next, put the ham in the bowl and press the '''Turbo''' 4 or 5 times.  
| Check the size and if you want it to be chopped more finely, press the '''Turbo''' 3 or 4 times more.  The time depends on how hard the ham is.  Remove from the bowl and reserve.
| Without washing the bowl, add the garlic, tomatoes and salt '''30 seconds / Speed 5'''.
| Add the bread and vinegar '''30 seconds / Speed 5''' and '''2 minutes / Speed 10'''.  The time will depend on the quality of the tomatoes.
| Running on '''Speed 5''', a pour the oil, little by little, onto the lid, without removing the MC, until it has finished emulsifying.
| Finally, pour the salmorejo into a dish and refrigerate, until you are ready to serve.
| A few minutes before, decorate with the ham and the eggs.  Serve very cold.

===Chef's notes===
If you wish, you can use 1.5 kg tomatoes and increase the other ingredients in proportion.
