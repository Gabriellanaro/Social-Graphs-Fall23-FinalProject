This vegetarian dish has been made mainly from ingredients produced in the Cotswolds - the garlic was Spanish and therefore the only non-local ingredient.

===Ingredients===
| 2 medium onions, finely chopped
| 2 tablespoons rapeseed oil
| 4 bulbs garlic, roasted and flesh squeezed from skin
| 2 medium carrots, diced
| 1 small head of broccoli, broken into florets
| 1 small purple cauliflower, broken into florets
| 8 leaves of cavolo nero (black leaf kale), coarsely shredded
| 560 ml dry cider
| 2 further teaspoons rapeseed oil
| 2 teaspoons flour 
| 280 ml vegetable stock
===Method===


| Using a large saucepan, gently fry the onions in the oil until soft and transparent.
| Add the vegetables and cook for a few minutes, stirring constantly.
| Add enough water to cover, bring to the boil, and simmer until the vegetable are cooked.
| Meanwhile, boil the cider until it has reduced by half and then add the vegetable stock.
| Just before the vegetables are ready, heat the 2 teaspoons rapeseed oil in a saucepan and stir in the flour.
| Allow to cook for a couple of minutes.
| Gently stir in the cider and the stock and add the squeezed garlic, cooking until the sauce has thickened.
| Strain the vegetables and serve with the sauce and a knob of butter.
===Serving suggestions===
Serve with boiled or mashed potatoes
===Variations===
Use any vegetables that are in season, including at least one root and one leafy vegetable.  

You can sprinkle a mixture of breadcrumbs, butter and finely grated cheese on the top and grill until brown.

Another alternative is to make it as a stew with herb dumplings.
===Chef's notes===
The rapeseed oil I use is '''[http://www.r-oil.co.uk/ R-Oil]''', which is produced in Lower Swell in the Cotswolds and the dry cider was from Hayles Fruit Farm, near Winchcombe.
