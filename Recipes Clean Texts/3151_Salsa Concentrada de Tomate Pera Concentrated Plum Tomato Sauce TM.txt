===Description===


This is a translation of a recipe in '''Salsas y Ali\u00f1os con Thermomix (Susaeta Ediciones)'''

===Ingredients===TM
| 1kg very ripe plum tomatoes
| ½ onion
| 2 tablespoons olive oil
| 1 sprig of basil
| 1 sprig of parsley
| ½ teaspoons sugar
| ½ teaspoon salt
===Method===


| Peel and cut the onion, put it in the bowl and chop '''5 seconds / Speed 4'''.  Remove from the bowl and reserve.
| Wash the tomatoes, cut them up and place in the bowl '''20 seconds / Speed 4'''.
| Add the onion, oil, salt, sugar and basil.
| Program '''45 minutes / Temp. Varoma / Speed 2'''.
| It is advisable to remove the MC so that the sauce evaporates and becomes more concentrated.
| Afterwards, replace the MC in the lid and blend '''1 minute / Speed 6''' so that you get a homogenous sauce.
| Place the mixture in a sieve to drain off any excess water to give it a thicker consistency.
===Serving suggestions===
Concentrated tomato is very suitable for the improvement of the flavour, colour and texture of other sauces.  It is also ideal for pizzas.  
===Chef's notes===
This sauce will keep for several months in sterilised jars and kept in a dark, dry place.
