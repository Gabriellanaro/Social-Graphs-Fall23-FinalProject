===Description===

This is a nut, pepper, and tomato sauce originally from Tarragona.

===Ingredients===
| 2 \u00f1oras
| 100 ml oil olive oil
| 500 g tomatoes, whole or sliced in half
| 25 g almonds, skinned
| 25 g hazelnuts, skinned
| 5 slices stale French stick
| 1 bulb garlic, skins intact
| 1-2 tablespoons white wine vinegar
| salt to taste 


===Mise en place===
* Preheat the oven to Gas 6/200C/400F
===Method===


| Soak the \u00f1oras in cold water for about an hour, having removed stalks and seeds if required.
| Meanwhile place the oil into a small roasting tin and place it into a cool oven.  
| Once the oven has reached temperature, place all of the other ingredients into the tin, except for the vinegar.
| After about 10 minutes turn the ingredients over and leave to roast for another 10 minutes.  It is a good idea to check the oven regularly to prevent over-cooking or burning.
| Drain the ingredients into a blender or food-processor, having peeled the tomatoes and garlic, reserving the oil.
| Add the vinegar and \u00f1oras to the salsa and blend throughly.
| Add the reserved oil, little by little until you have the required thickness.  Season to taste. and if necessary, add more oil.
===Serving suggestions===
Serve with meat, fish or vegetables and can also be used as a dressing.

===Variations===
Traditionally, the nuts, tomatoes, garlic and bread are grilled, but I find that roasting gives a richer flavour.

Some people like to include piquillo peppers to the salsa as they add sweetness.

===Chef's notes===
If you cannot find \u00f1oras, ancho peppers can be substituted.
