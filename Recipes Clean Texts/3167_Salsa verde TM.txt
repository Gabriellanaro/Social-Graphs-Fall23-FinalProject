===Serving suggestions===
This sauce is the basis for the preparation of many fish recipes and is ideal for accompanying roast or boiled potatoes, salads and white rice and pasta dishes.  Depending on which dish you ware making, the sauce can be added afterwards or incorporated in the making of the dish.  Fish is very good if cooked in the sauce.
