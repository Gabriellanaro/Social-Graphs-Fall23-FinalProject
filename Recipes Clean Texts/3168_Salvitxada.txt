This Catalan sauce is popular for dipping roasted or barbecued cal\u00e7ots (a type of onion).  It is similar to Salsa Romesco.

===Ingredients===
| 120 g almonds, peeled, toasted and ground
| 4 tomatoes, peeled and cooked
| 4-8 Cloves of garlic, peeled and cooked
| A few splashes of red wine vinegar
| Oil
| Seasoning
===Method===


| Put the first 4 ingredients into a blender and process until the sauce is smooth.
| Slowly add sufficient oil until it has bound with the sauce and season to taste.
| Allow to rest for a few hours before use.
===Serving suggestions===
Would make an excellent dip for various vegetables.
===Variations===
You can include paprika and finely chopped red pepper if you wish.

You are unlikely to find cal\u00e7ots in the UK so try roasting some large spring onions instead.
