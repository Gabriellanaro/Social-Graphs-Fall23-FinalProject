This is a very basic sangria recipe.  Try this first before you start adding bananas, kiwi fruit, peaches and suchlike.

You don't need to spend a fortune on the wine, a reasonable Rioja will be fine for this.

This recipe makes almost 1 litre of sangria
===Ingredients===
| 1 bottle of Spanish sangria
| 1 lemon, washed and slices
| 1 orange, washed and sliced
| 140 ml brandy
| 140 ml white sugar
| 280 ml club soda (sparkling water / soda water)
| Ice cubes
===Method===


| Into a large glass jug, add all of the ingredient except for the club soda.
| Using a wooden spoon, lightly bruise the fruit to release the flavours
| Refrigerate overnight.
===Serving suggestions===
Add the club soda and ice cubes and serve in a long glass such as a Highball glass
===Variations===
Use different fruits: peaches, kiwi fruit, banana, grapes, melon, apple, strawberries, limes etc.

Try ginger ale or lemon soda drinks such as fanta instead or club soda.
