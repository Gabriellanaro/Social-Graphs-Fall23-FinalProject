===Ingredients===
| 1.8kg whole leg of lamb
| 6 whole bulbs of garlic, papery outer skin removed 
| 2 tablespoons Belazu Catalonian extra virgin olive oil 
| 4000ml fino (dry) sherry 
| Â½ x 142ml fresh lamb stock
| salt and freshly ground black pepper 
'''For the potatoes:'''
* 1.15kg Desiree potatoes, peeled 
* 142ml fresh lamb stock 
* 2 teaspoons fresh thyme leaves 
* salt and freshly ground black pepper 
'''For the allioli:'''
* 1 large Clove of garlic, peeled and crushed 
* 1 large egg, at room temperature 
* 250ml Belazu Catalonian extra virgin olive oil 
* 1 tablespoon lemon juice 
* sea salt and freshly ground black pepper

===Mise en place===
* Preheat the oven to 220\u00b0 C (425\u00b0 F - gas 7)
===Method===


| Heat the olive oil for the lamb in a large pan and brown the leg of lamb all over. Season with salt and freshly ground pepper, put in an oiled roasting tin and roast in the middle of the oven for 20 minutes.
| After this time, remove the lamb from the oven and reduce the heat to 170\u00b0C, 325\u00b0F, Gas mark 3. Add 310ml of the sherry to the lamb, cover tightly with foil, and cook on the bottom shelf of the oven for 4 hours, basting every 30 minutes with the sherry. Add the 6 garlic bulbs after 2 hours. Check that the sherry is not drying up, and add more if necessary.
| While you are cooking the lamb, make the potatoes and the allioli. Cut the potatoes into very thin rounds, put in a large pan of salted water and bring to the boil. Drain, place in a shallow oiled oven proof dish, season with salt and freshly ground pepper, then add the half tub of lamb stock and sprinkle over the thyme leaves.
| Place in the oven on the shelf above the lamb for the last 1 hour 30 minues of the cooking time, after which time the potatoes will be golden and will have absorbed all the lamb stock.
| While the potatoes are cooking, make the allioli. Pur\u00e9e the Crushed garlic with the egg in a food processor, then mix the olive oil and tablespoon of lemon juice together in a jug and slowly pour into the egg mixture with the motor running. Add half a teaspoon of salt and some freshly ground black pepper and leave the motor on for a further 10 seconds, then transfer to a bowl, ready to serve.

| When the lamb is ready, remove it from the oven and transfer to a wooden board. To make the gravy, mash the cooked garlic with a potato masher, add the remaining half tub of lamb stock to the roasting tin, bring to the boil, season, strain through a coarse sieve or China cap and pour into a bowl, ready to serve. Carve the lamb and serve with the gravy and potatoes, with a healthy dollop of allioli on top.

===Chef's notes===
Unfortunately, in common with a lot of the Belazu published recipes, they don't appear to have been very well tested.  I have increased the potato cooking time by 30 minutes and you may still need to finish them off under the grill if you want them crisped up a little.
Don't be put off a recipe that calls for a leg of lamb because of the high cost.  This recipe can be adjusted for half a leg of lamb and you buy that (frozen) for just \u00a36.00! (March 2013).
