===Description===

A Spanish Thermomix recipe for prawn soup with mayonnaise.

===Ingredients===TM
| 100g bread
| 400g prawns
| 1000ml water
'''For the mayonnaise'''
* 1 large egg
* Salt
* Pepper
* 25g lemon juice
* 300g olive oil

===Method===


| Cut the bread into fine slices and toast it.
| Place the prawns in the internal steaming basket, add the water '''8 minutes / Temp. Varoma / Speed 1'''.
| Once cooked, strain off the water and keep it hot.
| Remove the prawns, peel them and reserve.
| Clean the bowl, add all the ingredients for the mayonnaise, apart from the oil '''10 seconds / Speed 5'''.
| Next, put the MC in a slightly inclined position, set '''Speed 4''' and add the oil, little by little until the mayonnaise has thickened.
| Set the TM to '''Speed 3''' and add the stock, little by little through the hole in the lid until this is totally mixed with the mayonnaise.
| Pour the soup into a soup tureen and place the bread and the prawns on top.
===Chef's notes===
Personally I think that this soup will need to be heated through before serving.
