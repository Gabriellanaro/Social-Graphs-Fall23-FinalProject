===Description===

Pyrenean vegetable soup made with a Thermomix.  See variations below for making the soup in a normal saucepan.

===Ingredients===TM
| 50g olive oil
| 150g leeks
| 50g celery
| 100g potatoes
| 100g French beans
| 125g cauliflower
| 125g broccoli
| 100g cabbage
| 50g carrots
| 50g parsley
| Garlic to taste
| 1.1kg vegetable or chicken stock
| 100g chicken breast, chopped
| 100g serrano ham, chopped 
| 1 free range egg
===Method===


| Coarsely chop the vegetables, garlic and parsley in the Thermomix - this may need to be done in various stages due to the different natures of the vegetables.
| Add the oil and 200ml of the water to the bowl.
| Using speed 4, pulse 3 times using the turbo button.
| Add the remaining water, the chicken breast and the ham.
| Set to cook for 30 minutes at 100 degrees with a speed of 1½.
| When it is cooked, beat in the egg at a speed of 2½.
===Variations===
Vary the vegetables to your choice.  To make this in the conventional manner, simply heat the oil in a saucepan and follow the instructions ignoring references to Thermomix speeds and temperature.  You will, of course need to chop the vegetables and meat by hand or in a food processor.
===Chef's notes===
You can chop the chicken breast and the bacon in the Thermomix if you wish.
