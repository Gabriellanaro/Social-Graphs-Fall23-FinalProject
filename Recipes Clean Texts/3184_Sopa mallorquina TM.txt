===Description===

Majorcan soup - so called because of the inclusion of PGI Sobrasada de Mallorca.  This is made in a Thermomix, but can easily be adapted for conventional cooking.

===Ingredients===TM
| 300g white cabbage
| 50g olive oil
| 1 potato, peeled and cut
| 1 carrot, peeled and cut
| 1 green pepper, cut
| 2 cloves garlic, peeled
| 1 onion, peeled and cut
| 2 chicken stock cubes
| Pepper
| 1 kg water
| 50g sobrasada
===Method===


| Cut the cabbage unto pieces and put in the bowl.
| Chop with 3 or 4 hits on the '''Turbo'''.
| Remove from the bowl and reserve a little of it to garnish.
| Put the remaining ingredients, except for the sobrasada, into the bowl '''7 seconds / Speed 3Â½''' until everything is well chopped.
| Add the cabbage '''25 minutes / 100\u00b0 / Reverse blade / Speed spoon'''.
| When that time has lapsed, check that the cabbage is cooked.
| Serve the soup in individual dishes, garnished with the reserved cabbage and the sobrasada, which has been shaped into quenelles with the help of two small spoons.
