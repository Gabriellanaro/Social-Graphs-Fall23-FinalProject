===Description===

This recipe was given to Anne yesterday by John and Louise and we tried it out last night.  A really nice, simple and tasty meal.

===Ingredients===

| 5 tablespoons olive oil
| Freshly ground black pepper
| 1 large onion, peeled and finely chopped
| 4 cloves of garlic, peeled and crushed (or to taste)
| 2 mugs basmati rice - well rinsed and drained
| 1 teaspoon unsmoked paprika powder
| A big pinch of chilli flakes or chilli powder
| 4 oz chopped chorizo sausage
| 1 stick of celery, sliced into moons
| 2 sweet peppers, deseeded, sliced and chopped
| A few tablespoon of vegetables of your choice
| 110g (4 oz) fresh mushrooms, brushed clean and sliced
| Dash of Worcestershire sauce
| Pinch of dried mixed herbs
| 2 mugs of boiling chicken stock for every mug of rice
'''garnish'''
===Ingredients===NB
| Freshly chopped parsley
===Mise en place===

* Preheat the oven to 180\u00b0 C (350\u00b0 F - gas 4), [fan oven 160\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]

===Method===


| Heat the oil in a dutch oven or flameproof casserole dish.
| Add a good grind of black pepper.
| Gently saut\u00e9 the onion, and peppers for 5 minutes until soft.
| Add the chorizo and garlic and stir-fry for a minute or so.
| Stir in the rice and allow it to become well coated with the oil.
| Add the remaining ingredients, stir really well.  Cover with a layer of tin foil, then add the lid.  This makes a really good seal.
| Bake for 30 minutes.
===Serving suggestions===
Serve with chopped fresh parsley
===Variations===
Use any vegetables you have to hand.  Frozen sweetcorn, Frozen peas, kidney beans, chick peas, green beans, etc.

Frozen vegetables can be added frozen with the stock.
===Chef's notes===
Most commercial stock powders are quite salty, so you shouldn't need any extra salt.

Omit the chorizo and use vegetable stock and this makes a nice vegetarian recipe.
