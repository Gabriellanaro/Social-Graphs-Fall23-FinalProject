===Description===

This is a basic Thermomix bread recipe.

===Ingredients===TM
| 350g water (see Chef's notes below)
| ½ teaspoons sugar
| 40g fresh bread yeast
| 600g strong flour
| 2 teaspoons salt (see Chef's notes below)

| Put the water and the sugar into the bowl '''2 minutes / 37\u00b0 / Speed 2'''
| Add the yeast, mix for a few seconds, incorporate the flour and salt '''15-20 seconds / Speed 6'''
| Next, knead '''3 minutes / Speed Dough'''
| Remove the dough with oiled hands.
| Shape as desired and leave to rise until double in size, covering it so that it does not form a crust
| Bake for 25-30 minutes at 220\u00b0 C (425\u00b0 F - gas 7), [fan oven 200\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour].\u00b0

===Recipe source===
* This is a translation of a recipe in '''''Thermomix TM31 - Imprescindible para tu cocina''''' which is the book supplied with Spanish TMXs
===Chef's notes===
Having made this dough this morning, I found it very hard to shape.  This is due to the recipe having only 58% hydration, ie not enough water, so next time, I will try it with 400g water.  Spanish butter is usually unsalted, so if you use salted butter, I would reduce the salt quantity in the dough.  However, in general the '''bread''' was good, crusty on the outside, with a nice, soft, but twisted looking crumb.
