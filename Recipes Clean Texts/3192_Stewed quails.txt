===Description===


This recipe is based on a combination of Spanish recipes for quail.  In Spain, they seem to be eaten much more than they are in the UK.

===Ingredients===
| 4 tablespoons oil
| 8 oven-ready quails
| 8 rashers of streaky bacon
| 3 medium onions, peeled and diced
| Garlic, to taste, chopped
| 2 teaspoons dried oregano
| 150 ml dry cider or white wine
| 1 litre hot vegetable or chicken stock, or enough to cover
| Seasoning
| Parsley to garnich, coarsely chopped
===Method===


| Heat the oil in a saucepan.
| Wrap a rasher of bacon around each quail and add to the pan with the onion.
| Cook until all sides of the quails are beginning to brown, the stir in the garlic and oregano.
| Cook for a few minutes until the garlic is golden.
| Add the cider or wine, the stock and seasoning.
| Cover, and simmer for about 45 minutes until the quails are cooked.
===Serving suggestions===
Garnish with the parsley and serve with fried potatoes and/or salad.
===Chef's notes===
We added 1 bulb of garlic for 2 quails, but vary the quantity as desired.  We used back bacon which is too short really and fell off the quails as they were browning.
