==Sun-dried tomatoes, without the sun==

Sun-dried tomatoes are a great item to have in the refrigerator as they have a long shelf-life and a small amount can lift almost any dish.

Here in the UK we seem to get very little sun so we have to resort to other methods.

Making Sun-dried tomatoes without the sun is an ideal task for a slow Aga.

===Ingredients===
| 16 large, good flavoured tomatoes or 32 cherry tomatoes
| 2 teaspoons of caster sugar
| A few sprigs of thyme
| 500ml of extra virgin olive oil
| Sea salt and black pepper


===Mise en place===

* Preheat the oven to it's lowest setting. About 100\u00b0 C (225\u00b0 F - gas Â¼), Aga: 'simmering oven'

===Method===


| With a sharp knife, cut the tomatoes in half.
| Lay them out on baking trays, lined with greaseproof paper, sprinkle with sugar and drizzle them with a little olive oil.
| Pick the thyme leaves off and sprinkle over the tomatoes, if you have lots of thyme you can lay the sprigs amongst the tomatoes for extra flavour.
| Place them in the oven for about 7 hours, or until most of the moisture has been removed - check them every hour or so as you don't want them to be crispy!
| Remove them and leave them to cool
| Sprinkle a sterilised jar with salt and pepper and add the sprigs of thyme.
| Add the tomatoes and cover with olive oil.
| They should keep for 6 months if refrigerated and always covered with oil.
===Variations===

Add a tablespoon of chili flakes if you like them spicy.

===FOOD POISONING===

Don't add garlic as some recipes suggest because there is a '''very real danger of botulism''' as it is an anaerobic toxin (one that develops in an air-free environment - read: Talk:Garlic olive oil.

If you want to be really scared, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botulism read what Wikipedia has to say on botulism].
