Nice to make this in my Thermy, and it went well with roast vegetables as you suggested.

===Description===

This is a translation of a recipe in '''Salsas y Ali\u00f1os con Thermomix (Susaeta Ediciones)'''

===Ingredients===TM
| 250g olive oil
| 1 large egg
| 4 pickled gherkins
| 1 tablespoon mustard
| 1 tablespoon capers
| 1 tablespoon chopped parsley
| 1 tablespoon chopped chives
| 1 tablespoon chopped onion
| 1 teaspoon vinegar
| Salt
===Method===


| Drain the capers and gherkins and cut the latter into several pieces.
| Place all of the ingredients apart from the oil and vinegar in the TM.
| Run the machine at '''Speed 4'''.
| With the MC in place, add the oil, little by little to the lid and carry on mixing until you have a similar texture to mayonnaise.
| Add the vinegar and mix for '''3 seconds / Speed 4''' and then halt the machine.
| Leave to rest 2 hours in the fridge before consumption.
===Serving suggestions===
This sauce is especially good for meat and fish, dressing salads, or it can give a quirky taste to roast vegetables.  
===Variations===
If you want a different texture, cut the gherkins into smaller pieces and mix them after the sauce has been made.
