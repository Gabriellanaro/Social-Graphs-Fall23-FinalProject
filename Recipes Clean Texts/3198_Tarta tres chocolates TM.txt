===Description===

This is a three chocolate dessert set upon a biscuit base

===Ingredients===TM
====For the base:====
===Ingredients===NB
| 1 small packet of biscuits (I used about 200g of plain Digestives, but the original was made with cinnamon biscuits)
| 100g butter
| 20g milk
====For the 1st layer:====
===Ingredients===NB
| 150g plain, dark chocolate
| 70g sugar
| 250g milk
| 250g double cream
| 1 sachet cuajada
====For the 2nd layer:====
===Ingredients===NB
| 150g milk chocolate
| 50g sugar
| 250g milk
| 250g double cream
| 1 sachet cuajada
====For the 3rd layer:====
===Ingredients===NB
| 150g white chocolate
| 25g sugar
| 250g milk
| 250g double cream
| 1 sachet cuajada

===Method===


====For the base:====

| Crush the biscuits 20 seconds / Speed 5-7-10
| Add the butter in pieces, and the milk '''2 minutes / 70 degrees / Speed 3''' (you will need to scrape down the inside of the bowl at some stage)
| Grease a loose bottomed tin, and line it with the mixture, smoothing it down, then place in the fridge
====For the 1st layer:====

| Break the plain chocolate into pieces and place in the bowl with the sugar, milk, cream and cuajada '''7 minutes / 90 degrees / Speed 5''' (I found that in my cold British kitchen, it needed an extra minute)
| Tip onto the biscuit base and put in the fridge until it has set
====For the 2nd layer:====

| Without washing the bowl, break the milk chocolate into pieces and place in the bowl with the sugar, milk, cream and cuajada '''7 minutes / 90 degrees / Speed 5''' (again, an extra minute may be required)
| Drag a fork over the top of the previous layer to make ridges to help the following layer stick and not run.
| Tip the milk chocolate mixture into the tin, carefully spreading it evenly (without prodding) using a spatula or reverse side of a spoon.  Take it to the fridge again to set.
====For the 3rd layer:====

| Makes more ridges over the 2nd layer, wash the bowl well so that the colours do not mix.
| Break the white chocolate into pieces and place in the bowl with the sugar, milk, cream and cuajada '''7 minutes / 90 degrees / Speed 5'''.
| Tip into the tin and refrigerate for several hours.
| Once chilled un-mould it from the tin.
| It can be frozen whole, but do not cut beforehand or it may become gooey.

===Chef's notes===
The original recipe is made in a heart-shaped tin, but if you don\u0092t have one, I would suggest using an 8 or 9 inch (20 or 23 cms) round tin or a 7 or 8 inch (18 or 20cm) square one. It just depends on how tall you want it. I used a 7 inch (18cm) round one which was too small so had to bin some of the mixture. Line with Bake-O-Glide if you like, then no need to grease.

The chocolate I used was that with the highest percentage of cocoa solids I could get.

The cuajada can be obtained from R Garcia & Sons in London.
