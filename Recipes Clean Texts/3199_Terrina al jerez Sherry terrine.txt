===Description===


This veal and chicken terrine is a garlicky adaptation of a recipe from Simone and In\u00e9s Ortega's book '''The Book of Tapas''' (ISBN 0714856134).  Unlike like the terrines I have made before, this one uses lard, rather than solid pork fat

===Ingredients===
| Oil
| 400 g boneless, skinless chicken breasts or thighs
| 500 g veal, minced
| 100 g lard, softened, plus some extra
| 2 tablespoons breadcrumbs
| 3 bulbs garlic, crushed
| 2 eggs, beaten
| 120 ml dry sherry
| Seasoning
| 150 g Serrano ham, in one piece then cut into small strips


===Mise en place===
* Preheat the oven to 180C/gas 4.
===Method===


| Heat some oil in a non-stick frying pan and brown the chicken breasts on each side for 2 minutes.
| Transfer to a small roasting tin and roast for 12 minutes, or until cooked.
| Remove from tin and allow to cool.
| Meanwhile, mix together the remaining ingredients, except of the Serrano ham.
| When the chicken has cooled, chop it roughly and add to the veal mixture.
| Reduce the oven temperature to 160\u00b0 C (325\u00b0 F - gas 3).
| Line a 1 kg bread pan or terrine with foil and grease the foil with the extra lard.
| Starting with the veal and chicken mixture, fill the terrine by layering alternately with the Serrano ham, ending with the veal.
|  Cover the top of the terrine with double-thickness of tin foil, making a lengthways pleat to allow the steam to rise.
|  Place the tin into a large roasting tin and fill it with hot water so that it comes half-way up the side of the bread tin. Add further water as and when it is necessary
| Cook for about two and a quarter hours, allowing an extra 15 minutes if the mixture has been refrigerated. The terrine is cooked when it has contracted from the sides of the tin and the juice runs yellow, when tested with a skewer.
| Remove from oven and whilst it is still hot, place several cans, eg tomatoes, horizontally and evenly on top of the foil, to press the terrine. Leave until completely cold.
| Chill for several hours or overnight, still weighted down.
| Remove the weights and foil and turn out onto clean foil.
| Wrap the foil around it and leave the p\u00e2t\u00e9 until it has been cold for at least 24 hours before cutting.
===Serving suggestions===
Serve with nice bread, salad and a good strong cheese. 
===Variations===
Experiment with various types of meat such as pork, game and salami and try wine, Calvados or cider instead of sherry.
===Chef's notes===
This terrine is very delicate, so be careful when slicing it.
