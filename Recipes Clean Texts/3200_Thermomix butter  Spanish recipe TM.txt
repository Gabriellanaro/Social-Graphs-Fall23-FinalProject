===Description===

The Spanish version of making butter in the Thermomix

===Ingredients===TM
| 200g whipping cream (minimum 35% fat)
| Your chosen flavouring
===Method===


| Put the cream into the bowl without the '''Butterfly''' and beat for a '''few minutes / Speed 7''', until you note a change in the sound of the machine.
| You will observe that the fat has separated from the whey.
| Put the internal steaming basket in the bowl and run it under the cold tap until the water becomes clean.
| Drain through the basket and dry well with kitchen paper.
| If you want to flavour it, add your chosen ingredient once the butter has been made and mix at Speed 5.
| Also, you can flavour it at the beginning, adding the chosen ingredient to the cream, but bear in mind that washing will make it lose its flavour.
