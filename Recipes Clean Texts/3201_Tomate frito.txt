Lots of work for tomato sauce, but probably worth it if you use lots.

===Description===

Literally 'Fried tomato', this is a basic sauce from the Pais Vasco

===Ingredients===
| 3 kg fresh, ripe tomatoes, seeds removed and chopped
| 75 ml olive oil
| 10 g salt
| A pinch of ground black pepper
| Garlic, to taste, finely chopped
| 3 onions, finely chopped
| A sprig of parsley, finely chopped
===Method===


| Put  the tomatoes and the oil in a pan with the other ingredients.
| Cover the pan and allow to cook slowly for about 30 minutes.
| Drain the liquid through a sieve and pur\u00e9e the tomato mixture.
| Store in a sterilised jar or keep in a Lock&Lock jug in the fridge.
===Serving suggestions===
Use this as the basis for other sauces or spread on toast or Molletes antequeranos.
===Chef's Notes=== 
Keep the drained liquid for making Gazpacho or other soups.  Removing seeds can be a bit of a chore so I did not bother.  It tastes fine and you end up with more liquid.
