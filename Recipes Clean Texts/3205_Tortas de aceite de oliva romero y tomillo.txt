 The Judge 
===Description===

I bought some of these and fell in love with them.  They are thin biscuit-type affairs and are mostly sweetened.  However, '''[http://www.inesrosales.com/ Ines Rosales]''' of Seville also make them with rosemary and thyme and it is this variety which I attempt to reproduce here.

===Ingredients===
| 50 ml olive oil
| 1/2 a teaspoon of dried thyme
| 1/2 a teaspoon of dried rosemary
| 130 g white bread flour 
| 50 g wholemeal bread flour
| 10 g fresh yeast
| 80 g tepid water
| ½ a teaspoon of sugar
| Sea salt
===Method===


| Heat the oil and allow the thyme and rosemary to infuse gently/
| Allow to get cool completely.
| Pour into a bowl and add all of the remaining ingredients, except for the salt.
| Knead gently and allow to rise until doubled. 
| Shape the dough into little balls about the size of a walnut, and roll them out thinly. 
| Sprinkle with sea salt and bake at 160\u00b0 C (325\u00b0 F - gas 3) until golden.
===Variations===
You can make the dough in a breadmaker if you wish, in which case use 5g easy-bake dried yeast.
