June, up here in Norfolk, every other stall has fresh asparagus for sale.  This is a great way top use it.

===Description===

This summery tortilla originates from La Mancha in Spain.

===Ingredients===
| 400 g fresh green asparagus spears, trimmed and cut into 2.5 cm pieces
| 8 tablespoons olive oil
| 350 g potatoes, peeled and cut into smallish dice
| Salt
| 1 medium onion, thinly sliced
| Garlic to taste, finely diced
| 100 g fresh breadcrumbs
| 8 eggs, beaten
| 2 tablespoons chopped parsley
===Method===


| Boil the asparagus for 5 minutes until just tender.
| Drain, plunge into cold water and drain again.
| Meanwhile, heat the oil to medium in a large-ish frying pan.
| Add the potatoes and salt to taste.
| Cook for about 10 minutes, turning regularly so that they do not brown.
| Add the onion and garlic and cook for a further 5 minutes.
| Stir in the asparagus and breadcrumbs and saut\u00e9 for 3 minutes.
| Remove from the heat and drain off any excess oil, reserving 1-2 tablespoons of the oil.
| Mix the eggs, parsley and a little more salt in a bowl.
| Pour the asparagus and potato mixture into the same bowl.
| Wipe the frying pan with kitchen towel and return it to the heat with the reserved oil.
| Pour the egg mixture into the pan and spread it evenly without stirring.
| Cook for about 3 minutes until the tortilla is nearly set.
| Flip the tortilla face downwards onto a plate and slide it back into the frying pan so that the other side will cook.
| Keep the pan on the heat for a further couple of minutes, by which time the tortilla should be ready.
| Cut into wedges and serve warm (not hot).
===Serving suggestions===
Serve with salad and bread or as a tapa with some olives.
===Variations===
As asparagus has such a short season in the UK, you only have a few options if you want to make this at any time of the year.  Never having eaten tinned asparagus, I neither recommend nor decry it.  However I have eaten the white Esp\u00e1rrago de Navarra which is available throughout the year in jars.  It tends to be much thicker than English asparagus so may need to be sliced, rather than cut into lengths.  It has an excellent flavour, although any resulting tortilla would not be as colourful as those made with the green variety.
