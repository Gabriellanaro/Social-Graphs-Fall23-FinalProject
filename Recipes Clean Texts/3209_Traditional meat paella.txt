\"Hola, Traditional Valencian Paella in my opinion is best eaten outdoors and even better with friends. In Spain many family members and friends come together to eat Paella at home, on the beach, in restaurants and at Fiesta time as anytime is a good time to eat Paella. Here are some Paella recipes to help you on your Paella journey. Happy eats,  buena comida, buenos amigos (Good food, good friends) gracias.\"

===Ingredients===

| 4 Chicken thighs or 3 chopped chicken breasts
| 225g Chorizo sausage ring (sliced)
| 400g Rabbit (Optional)
| 1 medium Onion (Chopped)
| Half red pepper (Chopped)
| 200g chopped tomatoes
| 2 cloves of garlic (crushed and chopped)
| 4 strands of Saffron (if available)
| Half  teaspoon of Paella Colourant
| Half teaspoon of Paprika Dulce
| 300g Bomba Rice
| 100g Frozen garden peas
| Small tin of black olives
| 250ml of chicken stock
| 75 ml white wine (optional)
| Water (if required)
| 2 Bay leaves
| Salt and pepper to taste
| Chopped Fresh Parsley
| Lemon wedges to garnish

===Method===


| In your Paella pan (38cm to 42cm recommended) pour in around 2 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil and set heat to medium to high.
| Add chicken and rabbit (optional) and cook until browned.
| Add the sliced chorizo ring, onions, garlic, red pepper and cook for 3 minutes until onions are starting to soften.
| Add the bay leaves, half tin of tomatoes, wine, chicken stock and bring to the boil. Then add Paprika Dulce, Paella Colourant, Saffron (Grind up the strands with a pestle and mortar to start the flavour flowing), garden peas and stir round (the smell from this should be amazing!).
| Sprinkle the Bomba Rice evenly around the pan, stir in and bring back up to boil and turn down the heat to simmer (add water if rice soaks up the liquid quickly).
| Cook for a further 20 minutes or until the Bomba Rice is soft to bite. Keep stirring throughout so the rice does not stick to the bottom of the pan (Although in Spain Traditional Paella is cooked to stick to the bottom of the pan so the choice is yours?).
| Add the black olives, remove the bay leaves and stir in the fresh chopped parsley.
| Season to taste with salt and black pepper. Take off the heat and cover for 5 minutes to let all the ingredients truly infuse together.
===Serving suggestions===
Serve with lemon wedges and tuck in for a fantastic treat for you and your guests!!

===Chef's notes===
Eat the meat you like and take out the meat you don't like.

Add half teaspoon of hot paprika if you like a bit of heat in your food. It also enhances the favours in the dish.

Double the amounts above if cooking for 8 and so on.

Quite a big pan that.  Not sure if I've got one that large in my cupboards!
