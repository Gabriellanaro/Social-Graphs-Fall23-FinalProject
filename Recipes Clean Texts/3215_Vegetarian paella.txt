===Chef's notes===
It is best to use proper paella rice, eg Bah\u00eda or Bomba (DOP Valencia).  I think you can get this in Waitrose and Tesco.

Jars of preserved peppers such as '''Pimientos del Piquillo de Lodosa''' (DOP Navarra) can be obtained from delicatessens.  In the absence of Spanish ones, Lidl sells a fairly respectable Turkish alternative.
