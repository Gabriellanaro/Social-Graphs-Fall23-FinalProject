===Description===

\"Hola, Traditional Valencian Paella in my opinion is best eaten outdoors and even better with friends. In Spain many family members and friends come together to eat Paella at home, on the beach, in restaurants and at Fiesta time as anytime is a good time to eat Paella. Here are some Paella recipes to help you on your Paella journey. Happy eats,  buena comida, buenos amigos (Good food, good friends) gracias.\"

''Dominic Green'': Paella World

===Ingredients===

| 8 green beans (Chopped)
| 150g Asparagus spears (ends trimmed)
| 1 courgette (Sliced)
| 1 medium Carrot (Diced)
| 1 medium Onion (Chopped)
| Half red pepper (Chopped)
| 200g chopped tinned tomatoes
| 2 cloves of garlic
| 4 strands of Saffron (if available)
| Half teaspoon of Paella Colourant
| Half teaspoon of Paprika Dulce
| 300g Bomba Rice
| 100g Frozen garden peas
| Small tin of black olives
| 250ml of vegetable stock
| 125ml of white wine (optional)
| Water (if required)
| 2 Bay leaves
| Salt and pepper to taste
| Chopped Fresh Parsley
| Lemon wedges to garnish

===Method===


| Chop the garlic, Onion, pepper and vegetables.
| In your Paella pan (38cm to 42cm recommended) pour in around 2 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil and set heat to medium to high.
| Add onions, garlic, red pepper, carrot, green beans and cook for 3  minutes until onions are starting to soften.
| Add the bay leaves, asparagus, courgette, half tin of tomatoes, wine, vegetable stock and bring to the boil.
| Then add Paprika Dulce, Paella Colourant, Saffron (Grind up the strands with a pestle and mortar to start the flavour flowing), garden peas and stir round (the smell from this should be amazing!).
| Sprinkle the Bomba Rice evenly around the pan, stir in and bring back up to boiling and turn down the heat to simmer ( add water if rice soaks up the liquid quickly).
| Cook for a further 20 minutes or until the rice is soft to bite. Keep stirring throughout so the Bomba Rice does not stick to the bottom of the pan (Although in Spain Traditional Paella is cooked to stick to the bottom of the pan so the choice is yours).
| Add the black olives, remove the bay leaves and stir in the fresh chopped parsley. Season to taste with salt and black pepper.
| Take off the heat and cover for 5 minutes to let all the ingredients truly infuse together.
===Serving suggestions===
Serve with lemon wedges and tuck in for a fantastic treat for you and your guests!!

===Chef's notes===
Experiment and add vegetables you like\u0085.mushrooms or artichoke hearts as an example and take out those you don\u0092t.

Add half teaspoon of hot paprika if you like a bit of heat in your food. It also enhances the favours in the dish.

Use of meat substitute eg veggie sausages can be added.

Double the amounts above if cooking for 8 and so on.
