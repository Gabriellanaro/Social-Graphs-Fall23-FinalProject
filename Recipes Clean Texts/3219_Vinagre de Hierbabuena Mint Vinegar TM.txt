===Description===

This is a translation of a recipe in '''Salsas y Ali\u00f1os con Thermomix (Susaeta Ediciones)'''

===Ingredients===TM
| 5 mint sprigs
| 600g white wine vinegar
===Method===


| Put the vinegar in the TM.
| Program '''7 minutes / Temp. Varoma / Speed spoon''', so that the vinegar will heat without boiling.
| Leave to cool a little.
| Wash and dry the mint.
| Place it into a container and pour the vinegar over it.
| When it is totally cold, transfer it into a bottle, together with the mint leaves.
| Cover tightly and leave for 2 or 3 weeks depending on the flavour you want to obtain.
===Serving suggestions===
This aromatised vinegar is especially suited to dress all types of salad, whether a vegetable or a fruit one.  It also goes well with roast lamb.
