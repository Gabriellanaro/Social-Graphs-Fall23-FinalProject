===Description===

Another method of cooking rice in your Thermomix.

===Ingredients===TM
| 50g extra virgin olive oil
| 3 cloves garlic (optional)
| 800g water
| Salt, to taste
| 350g rice [I presume they are referring to Spanish rice such as Valencia, Bomba, Calasparra etc]
===Method===


| Put the oil, water and salt into the bowl and insert the internal steaming basket '''7 minutes / Temp. Varoma / Speed 1''', to boil the water.
| Pour the rice through the hole in the lid '''13 minutes / Temp. Varoma / Speed 4''' (move the rice about using the spatula from time to time.
| When the time is up, check that the rice is cooked to your taste and if not, program for a further '''2 minutes at the same temperature and speed'''.
| Immediately remove the basket with the rice, tip it into a wide dish and leave until it has lost a little heat.
===Recipe source===
* This is a translation of a recipe in '''''Thermomix TM31 - Imprescindible para tu cocina''''' which is the book supplied with Spanish TMXs.
===Variations===
If you want the rice with a garlic sofrito, put 3 cloves of garlic and the oil into the bowl '''3 minutes / Temp. Varoma / Speed 4'''.  Then follow the recipe according to the instructions above.
