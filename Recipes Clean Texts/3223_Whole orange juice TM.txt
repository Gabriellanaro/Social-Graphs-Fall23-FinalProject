===Description===

A Spanish drink made from whole oranges

===Ingredients===TM
| 5 juicy oranges, peeled, pith and pips removed
| 1 lemon, pith and pips removed
| 6 ice cubes
| 100g sugar or 10g saccharine [100g sugar is a lot and I would suggest starting with 60g]
| 500g water
===Method===


| Put all the ingredients in the bowl, except for the water '''1 minute / Speed 5'''
| Next, '''2 minutes / Speed 5-10 progressively'''
| It should be well pulverised, but repeat the operation if necessary
| Add the water and mix for a '''few seconds / Speed 2'''
| Put the internal steaming basket into the bowl and holding it in with the spatula, pour the juice into a jug with ice cubes
