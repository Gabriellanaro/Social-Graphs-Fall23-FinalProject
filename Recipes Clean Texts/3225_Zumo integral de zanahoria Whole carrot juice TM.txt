===Description===

This recipe for carrot juice needs to be made in a Thermomix.  It uses the whole carrots whereas if made in a juicer the pulp will be wasted.

This is a translation of a recipe in '''Thermomix TM31 Imprescindible para tu cocina''', which is the book you receive when buying a Thermomix in Spain.

===Ingredients===TM
| 350g carrots, peeled
| 1 lemon, peeled, pith and seeds removed
| 100g sugar (see Chef's notes below)
| 500g water (approx)
| 6 or 8 ice cubes
===Method===


| Chop the carrots '''5 seconds / Speed 5'''.
| Add the lemon, sugar, water and ice cubes and set for '''3 minutes / Speed 10'''.
| If it is not smooth enough for you, repeat the operation for a little longer.
| Add the basket to the bowl to strain it, hold it down with the spatula and pour into a jug filled with ice.
| If it is well blended, there is no need to strain it.
===Chef's notes===
The sugar content is high and can be cut down.  I found the juice to be very sweet and feel that 60g is sufficient.  However, I did not pour mine over a jug of ice, which would have made it less sweet.

You might need ear plugs when processing at '''Speed 10'''!
