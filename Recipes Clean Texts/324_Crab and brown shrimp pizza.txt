===Description===

Being a seafood lover I thought that crabmeat would be nice on a pizza.  When Anne came in with the ingredients, she surprised me with a pack of peeled brown shrimps so I combined the two and made a fabulous pizza.

The only downside was the amount of liquid in the crabmeat, added to increase the nett weight rather than for any culinary reason.  It made the pizza a little wet.  Next time I make this I will spin the crabmeat in a salad spinner to reduce the amount of liquid.  If you don't have a salad spinner just sit the crabmeat in a sieve for 30 minutes.

===Ingredients===

| 1 portion of Pizza dough (makes 2 pizzas)
| About 6 tablespoons of Tomato sauce for pizza or passata
| 1 small onion, very finely chopped
| 90g peeled brown shrimp (1 small pack)
| 100g white & brown crab meat (1 small pot)
| 2 balls mozzarella cheese torn into small pieces(about 250g in total)
| Chili oil to taste
| sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
===Mise en place===

* Preheat the grill to high - with a pizza stone if you have one

===Method===


| Divide the pizza dough into two and roll out into two pizzas
| Make each pizza individually and place the first one in the oven to keep warm whilst the second pizza completes
| Grill the pizza for about 2 to 3 minutes per side with no toppings added
| Removed the part-baked pizza and spread with Tomato sauce for pizza or passata
| Sprinkle with the finely chopped onions
| Add the peeled brown shrimp and cover with the crabmeat
| Arrange the torn mozzarella over the seafood. Try to cover as much of the seafood as possible so it does not get too crisped
| Season with salt and black pepper and drizzle with chili oil if liked
| Bake for about 3 or 4 minutes under the hot grill until the mozzarella just starts to brown
| Serve immediately
