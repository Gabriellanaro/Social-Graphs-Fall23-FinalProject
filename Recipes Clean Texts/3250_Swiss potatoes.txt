===Chef's notes===
The original recipe was for four, I have adjusted the ingredients for 2 people and allowed for a mixture of olive oil and butter.

Squirty Marmite is ideal for this recipe making it very easy to add without breaking up the potatoes too much.

A fabulous recipe which will be much used, thank you Julia!
