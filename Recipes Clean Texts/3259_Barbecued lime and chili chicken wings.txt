[[Image:Lime and chili chicken wings marinading.jpg|300px|thumb|right|Ready to marinate]]
Lime, chili and salt go so well together that I now have a hankering for a Mexican drink!

===Ingredients===
| 1 kg [2 lb] chicken thighs or wings, skin on and bone in
| 125 ml [4 fl oz] freshly squeezed lime juice
| 4 fresh red bird's eye chillies, finely chopped
| Â½ teaspoon sea salt
| 1 teaspoon demerara sugar or jaggery
| 3 teaspoons olive oil
===Method===


| Mix the lime juice, chili, salt, sugar and oil together in a bowl
| Cut some deep slashes into the flesh so the marinade can 'work' on the meat
| Marinate the chicken in a refrigerator for 2 hours or more, turning a few times
| Barbecue the chicken for about 15 minutes on a well oiled grill, turning often to prevent burning
| Check the chicken is properly cooked before serving
===Serving suggestions===

Serve with a green salad, jacket potatoes, sour cream and Pickled jalape\u00f1os
===Variations===
You could make this with chicken thighs or drumsticks.  Larger pieces will take a little longer to cook.  Check the juices run clear when the thickest part is pierced with a fork.

These can also be cooked on an oven tray with a rack at 180\u00b0 C [350\u00b0 F - Gas 4 - Moderate/Medium]. Allow 40 minutes for small pieces like wings. 50 minutes for larger pieces like thighs and drumsticks. Check juices run clear and leave to rest for 5 minutes before serving.    
Try this marinade with lamb tenderloin fillets or king prawns
