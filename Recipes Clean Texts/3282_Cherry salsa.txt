Great with pork and lamb

I made this and tried it with pork first, then lamb.  It cuts through the fattiness of lamb really well.

===Description===

This tangy salsa goes perfectly with pork and duck dishes such as duck fajitas.

It's also a great way to get your wok bright and shiny again!

===Ingredients===
| 1 red onion, finely chopped
| 1 garlic clove, crushed
| 1 small red chili, deseeded and chopped finely
| 125 g (4½ oz) demerara sugar or jaggery
| 30 ml (1fl oz) Dry sherry
| 450 g (1 lb) cherries, de-stoned
| 100 ml (3½ fl oz) sherry vinegar
| Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
| 1 tablespoon olive oil
===Method===


| Add the oil to a pan and fry the onions and garlic until the onions are translucent and soft
| Add the chili and stir fry for a minute
| Add the sherry and cook until reduced by a half or more
| Tip in the cherries and cook for 4 minutes
| If using jaggery it helps to `powder' it first by bashing with the blunt end of a rolling pin
| Add the sherry vinegar and sugar and bring to the boil, turn down a little and keep it bubbling for 10 minutes or until the cherries soften
| Allow to cool
