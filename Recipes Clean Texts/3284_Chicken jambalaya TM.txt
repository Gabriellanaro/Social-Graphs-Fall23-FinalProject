===Description===

This is a chicken jamabalaya recipe for the Thermomix.  The chicken is steamed in the Varoma basket, but can also be poached in the bowl at 90\u00b0.

===Ingredients===TM
| 1 x 1.3kg chicken, parson's nose removed
| 1 small onion, cut into quarters
| 1 bay leaf
| Garlic, to taste, peeled
| 30g butter, ghee or olive oil
| 100g cooked bacon
| 4 spring onions, chopped on the diagonal
| 2 sticks of celery, chopped into half-moons
| 2 sweet peppers, any colour, deseeded and chopped
| 200g basmati rice
| 2 teaspoons paprika powder
| Â½ teaspoon dried oregano or dried mixed herbs
| 2 tablespoons fresh basil leaves, chopped, if available
| 1 400g tin plum tomatoes, chopped
| 1 tablespoon Worcester sauce
| Chillies, chilli sauce or chilli powder - I used 1 teaspoon extra hot chilli powder and 1 tablespoon Nando's Piri-Piri sauce
| Parsley, chopped (optional)
===Method===


| Fill the TM bowl with 1.2kg water and add the onion and bay leaf.
| Place the chicken in the Varoma basket '''30 minutes / Temp. Varoma / Speed 2'''. 
| Turn chicken over and continue cooking for another 30 minutes. 
| Check for done-ness and cook for longer if necessary. 
| Remove the basket and allow to cool, reserving the steaming water and discarding the onion and bay leaf. 
| Remove the meat from the bones. 
| Add the garlic to the bowl and chop '''5 seconds / Speed 5''' then scrape down the inside of the bowl. 
| Add the butter or oil, bacon, spring onions, celery and pepper and saut\u00e9e '''10 minutes / Temp. Varoma / Speed 1 / MC off'''. 
| Add the rice and cook for '''1 minute / Temp. Varoma / Speed 1 / MC off'''. 
| Add the tomatoes, spices, herbs, Worcester sauce, hot pepper sauce and chicken. 
| Fill the bowl with the reserved steaming water until you reach the 2 litre mark in the bowl.
| Cook '''15 minutes  / 90\u00b0  / Speed Spoon / Reverse Blade''' or until the liquid has gone and the rice is cooked - it may help to remove the MC for part of the cooking time.
| Add a little more water if it dries out before the rice is done. 
| Serve and garnish with the finely chopped parsley if desired.
