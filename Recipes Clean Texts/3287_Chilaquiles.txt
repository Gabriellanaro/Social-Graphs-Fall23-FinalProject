===Description===

Chilaquiles are a traditional Mexican dish. Typically, corn tortillas cut in quarters and lightly fried are the base of the dish. Green or red salsa or mole, is poured over the crisp tortilla triangles, called totopos. The mixture is simmered until the tortilla starts softening. Eggs (scrambled or fried) and pulled chicken are sometimes added to the mix. The dish is topped with cheese (typically grilled chihuahua  cheese ) and/or sour cream (crema), and it is served with refried beans. Like many dishes, regional and familiar variation are quite common.

===Ingredients===
| 10 corn tortillas cut up in triangles (tortilla chips)
| ½ Cup of corn oil
| 3 Cloves of garlic
| ½ Onion
| 4 Medium Size Tomatoes
| 3 chilli peppers (I suggest Chile Serrano)
|* ''Serrano is classed as a hot chilli if you are looking for an equivalent''
| 1 Cup of sour cream 
| 1 Cup of grated chihuahua cheese or Monterey Jack cheese
| 1/2 a teaspoon of salt.
===Method===


| On a deep frying saucepan fry the tortillas
| On a pot toast the tomatoes, chilli peppers,  onion and garlic. Liquidate the tomatoes, salt, chilli peppers, onion and garlic.
| As the tortilla is frying add the sauce.
| Let the tortilla dunk into the sauce but make sure the chips don't get too soft.
| Add the chihuahua  cheese and it will melt with the heat.
===Serving suggestions===
Serve with sour cream and grilled chihuahua cheese on top.
===Chef's notes===
You may add epazote leaves, to the sauce!

===Chef's notes===
If you're making this in Europe, a mild white cheddar is a good substitute for chihuahua cheese or Monterey Jack cheese.
===Chef's notes===
If you want to do this en Ecuador, use ripe mozzarella cheese and you can use paico is the same that epazote (A.V)
