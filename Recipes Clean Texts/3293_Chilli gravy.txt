===Description===


OK chilli freaks, here's a chance to excel!  In common with chillies, chilli gravy goes with just about anything.

It is great over any barbecued meats and sausages and mandatory for Tex-Mex meals.

The beauty is that you can tailor the flavours to suit your tastes.  It also freezes well in 'meal-sized' portions.

===Ingredients===
| 3 tablespoons olive oil (or the less healthy lard option!)
| 2 big garlic cloves, peeled and crushed.
| 1 medium onion, peeled and sliced.
| 2 tablespoons lardons (or home smoked bacon, chopped).
| Your own variety of dried chillies, powdered in a coffee grinder
| ¼ teaspoon cumin seeds, ground in a coffee grinder
| ¼ teaspoon dried oregano
| 2 cups water
| 2 cups beef stock
| 1 tablespoon masa harina
| Sea salt to taste
===Method===


| Saut\u00e9 the onions, garlic and lardons on a medium heat in the olive oil until soft, about 7 minutes.
| Add the herbs and spice and mix well.
| Add the liquids, just bring to the boil and immediately reduce to a simmer and cook, uncovered for 30 minutes.
| Use a little of the stock to mix the masa harina to a paste and then add back into the stock, whisk well and simmer for another 10 minutes.
| Taste and season with salt if required.
===Variations===
Cheat, cheat, cheat!

I found half a pot of commercial onion gravy in the freezer which prompted this recipe. (I wanted something to liven up some meatballs).

If you are starting with a ready-made (onion) gravy, just omit the olive oil, lardons, onions, garlic, stock and water.
===Chef's note===
Probably not at all authentic, but the juice of 1 lime, 2 teaspoons of brown sugar and a tablespoon of tomato puree rounds this off nicely.
