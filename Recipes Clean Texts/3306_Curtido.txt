Curtido is a relish from El Salvador that contains pickled cabbage, onions and carrots

It resembles sauerkraut, for which we also have a recipe and is usually served with pupusas

===Ingredients===
| ½ cabbage, shredded finely and blanched in boiling water
| 1 medium onion, sliced
| 1 carrot, finely grated
| ½ red pepper, finely chopped
| White wine vinegar
| 1 tablespoon lime juice
| 1 teaspoon oregano
| salt to taste
===Method===


| In a large wide-mouthed jar, mix all of the ingredients with a wooden spoon
| Add vinegar to taste and top up with water
| Refrigerate for 1 week so the ingredients pickle.  Leave the cap off and cover with a cloth.
| Don't seal the jar until fermentation is complete as it may explode!
