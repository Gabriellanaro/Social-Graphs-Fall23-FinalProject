So nice, so easy and SO MUCH OF IT!!!

 

The Judge 

This is very cheap and easy to make and it's pretty healthy too.  If you're watching your fats, go for a low fat yogurt.

This is made easier with the chopping attachment of a food processor.

===Ingredients===
| Â½ red cabbage
| 2 carrots, peeled
| 1 apple, peeled and cored
| Handful of raisins, sultanas or dried apricots
| 500g pot Greek yogurt (large pot)
===Method===


| Chop all of the vegetables in the food processor
| Chop the apricots if using
| Mix together and stir in the yogurt
| If you want to be a bit spartan, use less yogurt or even a small pot, but then it won't be creamy coleslaw!
| Chill for 30 minutes before serving
