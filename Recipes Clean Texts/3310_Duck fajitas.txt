Not sure what you call this, but it is just fabulous. Hot and spicy.

===Description===

[[Image:Duck fajitas recipe.jpg|thumb|300px|right|A splash of sherry]]
An unusual slant on the Mexican favourite.  Serve this with '''cherry salsa''', chopped avocados, spring onions and cucumbers and you will have an exceptional evening meal.  As it's a Mexican variation of crispy duck pancakes there is nothing to stop you using Chinese pancakes for this dish (except you can get more in a tortilla!)

===Ingredients===
| 2 duck breasts with skin
| 150 g (5 oz)  Monterey Jack cheese, grated
| 1 red onion, sliced
| 2 sweet peppers of any colour, de-seeded and sliced
| 2 small hot red chillies, deseeded and sliced into rings
| Pinch of cayenne pepper
| ¼ teaspoon of dried oregano
| ½ teaspoon ground white cumin seeds
| ½ teaspoon garlic powder or dried minced garlic (ground)
| Splash of dry sherry
| 1 Packet of corn tortillas
| 2 large spring onions, sliced on the diagonal

1/2 cucumber, peeled and julienned or quartered lengthwise and sliced in a food processor

===Method===


| With a very sharp knife, cut a few slashes in the skin of the duck
| Place the duck, skin-side down in a cold frying pan and cook for 10 minutes on a medium heat, regularly draining any excess fat.
| Flip the breasts over and cook for another 10 minutes or so, until nicely seared. Duck is ok to eat rare.
| Remove and rest for 5 minutes
| Cut the duck width-wise into slices
| Heat the pan, with a little oil until, add the peppers and onions and and fry on a high heat for about 4 minutes. Add all but the sherry and spring onions and stir-fry for a few minutes
| Add a good splash of sherry and stir to de-glaze the pan.
| Place the duck mixture in a serving bowl
| Assemble the pancakes like this
===Serving suggestions===

Bring the tortillas, duck mixture, lime wedges, grated cheese, chopped avocados, spring onions and cucumber slices to the table and let everyone make their own tortillas.

===Chef's tip===

If using legs (I could not get breasts on the day I made this) you will probably be better cooking in an oven - they take so much longer because you don't get good contact with the pan as you do with breasts. 180\u00b0 C (350\u00b0 F - gas 4) for 45 minutes.

Duck is OK to eat rare.  I remember being muttered at by the ''charming'' waiter at in a French restaurant when asking for duck (breasts) ''bien cuit''!
