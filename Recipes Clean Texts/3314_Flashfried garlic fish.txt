===Description===

A wonderfully simple way to cook fish and keep the flavours and freshness.  This recipe makes expensive cod go a long way by slicing it into two thin fillets.

If you want to increase the servings to 4 people, just increase the fish, the rest should be fine as is.

===Ingredients===
| 2 x 200 g cod fillets. Get your fishmonger to slice it lengthwise into two thin fillets
| sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
| Juice from 2 limes and grated zest from 1
| 20 g (1 tablespoon) butter
| 4 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed

''' Garnish'''
* 4 tablespoons roasted sweet mixed peppers or bottled 
* sweet mixed peppers, chopped
* 4 tablespoons freshly chopped parsley
* 2 tablespoons Mayonnaise
* 1 orange, quartered

===Method===


| Season the fish fillets with sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
| Lay in a shallow dish and drizzle with the lime juice
| Leave to marinade for  2 hours
| Heat the butter and garlic for a minute or so, then add the fish and fry for a minute a side, or maybe slightly more if the fish is thicker.
| Plate up and spread with mayonnaise, sprinkle with peppers and parsley.
