[[Image:Garlic chilli courgettes recipe marinading.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Well mixed, now leave them to marinade for 30 minutes]]
Nice spicy side dish that makes a nice accompaniment for any meal.
===Ingredients===

| 2 courgettes, 'topped and tailed'
| 2 tablespoons olive oil
| Freshly ground black pepper
| Good pinch of sea salt
| 4 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed
| 1 tablespoon Taste Sensation Spicy Mango Marinade Flavouring
| 1 tablespoon lime juice

===Method===


| Using a mandoline, slice the courgettes very thinly, to no thicker than 3 mm
| Add the courgettes to a lock and lock box with all the other ingredients, apart from the lime juice
| Pop the lid on and shake like mad for a minute so they are well coated with all the lovely spicy flavourings
| Leave for 30 minutes or so to allow the flavours to mingle
| Heat a wok or large frying pan and stir fry for 3 or 4 minutes, turning regularly
| Add the lime juice, mix well and serve immediately
