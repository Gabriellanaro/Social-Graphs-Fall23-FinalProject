===Description===

This Tabasco style sauce is made with Indian green chillies

===Ingredients===TM
| 600g tomatoes, halved if small or quartered if larger
| 200g Indian green chillies, seeds and skin retained, but stalk removed
| 400g distilled white vinegar
| 4 tbsps dark sugar
| 2 teaspoons sea salt
===Method===


| Put all ingredients in the bowl, '''10 minutes / Temp. Varoma / Speed 2''' 
| Then '''10 minutes / 100\u00b0C / Speed 2'''
| Allow to cool a little, then '''1 minute / Speed 4-10 progressively'''
| Pass through a sieve and pour into a bottle or Lock & Lock tub.

===Recipe source===
* Very lightly adapted from Stef's recipe for '''[http://www.forumthermomix.com/index.php?topic=10345.0 Haba\u00f1ero Sauce Tabasco Style]''' on the '''[http://www.forumthermomix.com/index.php Thermomix Forum]'''
===Variations===
Stef's recipe uses Haba\u00f1ero chillies, which I find are almost impossible to find in the UK as this time of year (July).  If you are lucky enough to obtain any (or Scotch Bonnets), you will find it hotter than making with Indian green chillies.
===Chef's notes===
Stef advises that you wear rubber gloves when you are preparing the chillies.  Also be careful of the fumes when removing the lid of the Thermomix.
===Servings===
Servings: 160 - About 800ml
