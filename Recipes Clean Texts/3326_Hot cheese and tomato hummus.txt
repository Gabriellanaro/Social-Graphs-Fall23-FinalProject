The melted cheese on the top makes all the difference.

Not really a hummus, as I've not heard of a hot hummus before now. It's really a spicy bean pur\u00e9e.  It's based on a Mexican bean and cheese puree and made with leftovers from the freezer.  I added the sliced tomatoes to prevent the bean pur\u00e9e from drying out.

A fantastic recipe and you would never imagine it was vegetarian!

===Ingredients===
| 90 g dried haricot beans
| 90 g dried butter beans
| 2 litres of weak vegetable stock - I make up half the advised quantity of bouillon powder.
| 2 sticks of celery, roughly chopped
| 1 large sweet pepper, deseeded and chopped
| 1 bulb of garlic, peeled and crushed (''or to taste'')
| 1 onion, peeled and roughly chopped
| 3 tablespoons olive oil
| 1 tablespoon of Tex-Mex seasoning, or Old India Taco Seasoning, or chopped chillies, or chilli sauce.
| 110 g mature cheddar cheese, roughly grated.
| 3 large tomatoes, thinly sliced
| 1 to 2 tablespoons of yellow cornmeal.  Use '''only''' if the mixture looks far too wet and the end of the slow cooking process.

===Mise en place===
*  When you are ready to start the final bake, preheat the oven to 180\u00b0 C (350\u00b0 F - gas 4), [fan oven 160\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour].
===Method===


| Soak the beans in cold water overnight, rinsing and draining a few times if possible.
| Add the soaked beans, stock, celery, peppers, garlic, chopped onion, Tex-Mex seasoning (or equivalent) to a slow cooker on low and cook for 4 hours
| Using a stick blender reduce the mixture to the consistency of hummus.  If it is really wet, add a tablespoon of yellow cornmeal, stir well and check in another 15 minutes.  This is a very efficient way of reducing liquid, but use with caution as more than once, I've had to add more stock after doing this!
| Add 1.5 tablespoons of olive oil.  Mix well and remove from the heat.
| At this stage the mixture could be refrigerated or even frozen and the final cooking stage done at a later time.
| Once the oven is hot, coat a shallow oven proof dish with 1.5 tablespoons of olive oil and spread the bean mixture evenly over the surface.
| Sprinkle with grated cheese and top with the thinly sliced tomatoes.
| bake the puree for about 45 minutes to 1 hour.
===Serving suggestions===
Serve with soured cream and plain tortilla chips or broken up taco shells to use as edible spoons!

This dish is equally good hot or cold.  Store any unused pur\u00e9e in a Lock and Lock style box to prevent it drying out.
===Chef's notes===
I used dried black lentils for the beans and for health reasons, olive oil for the vegetable oil as this recipe uses rather a lot. For the cheese I used a mixture of mature gouda and mature cheddar.

===Variations===
This is a great recipe for experimentation.  Almost any vegetables can be added to this recipe.  Just use your imagination!
