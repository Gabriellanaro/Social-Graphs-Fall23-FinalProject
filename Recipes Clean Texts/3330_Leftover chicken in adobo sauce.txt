Looked and tasted divine
 

The Judge 

I've had half a jar of adobo sauce in the fridge since the Westdean chili fiesta in the summer.  I've used a little from time to time, even spread it on bread! but I thought it really should be used up now.

This was really a throw-together of 'fridge-forage', but it was so quick to cook and the picture so colourful, I thought it might give someone a little inspiration.

===Ingredients===
| 1 onion, peeled and chopped
| 3 cloves of garlic, crushed, or to taste
| Olive oil for frying
| Leftover cooked chicken or turkey for two
| 4 heaped tablespoons adobo sauce
| Handful of cherry tomatoes
| 1 cup of mixed beans or pulses
| 30g frozen peas, defrosted
| sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
===Method===


| Heat the garlic olive oil in a large frying pan and saut\u00e9 the onions and garlic for about 5 minutes on a medium heat until the onions are translucent
| Add the chicken or turkey pieces and stir fry for a few minutes
| Pour in the adobo sauce and mix well
| Add the beans and tomatoes and stir-fry for 5 minutes or until the beans are reheated
===Serving suggestions===
Serve hot with plain boiled rice
===Chef's tip===
Every now and then, we open four cans of different beans and pluses, add a cup of frozen peas to them and mix well, then freeze them in small plastic coffee cups for later use in recipes like this
