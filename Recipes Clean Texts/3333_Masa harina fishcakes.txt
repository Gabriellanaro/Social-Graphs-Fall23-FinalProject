===Description===

Another use for your garden squashes and pumpkins and an excuse to use your delicious masa harina.  These freeze well too.

===Ingredients===
| 1 small squash - about the size of a very large grapefruit
| Olive oil
| 2 fresh salmon fillets
| 6 defrosted king prawns, chopped small.
| A little milk
| 2 teaspoons butter
| 1 medium onion, peeled and finely chopped
| A handful of fresh parsley, chopped
| 2 teaspoons of chili flakes
| 2 teaspoons lemon juice
| 2 to 3 ladles of masa harina - I'm afraid I never got around to weighing the masa!
| 1 egg beaten with a little milk
| sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
| 120 g breadcrumbs


===Mise en place===
* Preheat the oven to 190\u00b0 C (375\u00b0 F - gas 5)
===Method===


| Saut\u00e9 the onion in a little olive oil until soft, about 5 minutes. Reserve.
| Place the salmon fillets in a flat dish and add a little milk just so the salmon stays moist.
| Halve the pumpkin and remove the seeds, leave the skin on as it's easier to remove the flesh after cooking than it is to peel first.
| Cut a few slashes in the squash, drizzle with olive oil and season well
| Roast in the top of the oven for 30 minutes or until the flesh is soft
| After the squash has been roasting for 15 minutes, bake the salmon, covered, in the bottom of the oven for the last 15 minutes.
| Scoop the pumpkin flesh into a bowl, add the butter, onions, lemon juice seasoning and chili flakes. mash well.
| Remove the skin from the salmon, drain and flake into the bowl with the squash, add the masa harina and mix well.
| Shape into oval patties, coat with beaten egg and roll in the breadcrumbs. Refrigerate for 30 minutes to allow the masa harina to absorb the moisture.
| Shallow fry for a few minutes a side turning often.
===Serving suggestions===
Serve with a green salad and Allioli a la moderna (garlic mayonnaise)
===Variations===
Add sesame seeds to the breadcrumbs
===Chef's notes===
If you don't want to use an oven, the squash can be sliced and boiled in water as you would potatoes. Leave the skin on for ease of preparation.  Half cover the salmon with milk and simmer in a shallow pan for 6 minutes, turning once.
