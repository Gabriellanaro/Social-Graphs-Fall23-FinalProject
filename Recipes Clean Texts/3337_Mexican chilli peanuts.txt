I've made these plenty of times before now, but the tip in Diana Kennedy's wonderful Mexican cookbook, ''Essential cuisines of Mexico'' ISBN 9780307587725, makes all the difference: \"don't use chilli powder, make your own by grinding up dried Chile de Arbole. The Cool Chile co can supply these.

===Ingredients===
| 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
| 1 cup, 250 ml raw unsalted shelled peanuts, brown papery skins removed and discarded
| 10 Cloves of garlic, peeled and crushed
| 1 to 1.5 teaspoon powdered chile de arbole
| 1 teaspoon fine sea salt
| Lime wedges to garnish
===Method===


| Heat the oil in a frying pan until hot but not smoking
| Tip the peanuts into the oil and fry for 1 minute, keeping them moving all the while
| Add the garlic and cook for another minute, again, stirring constantly
| Reduce the heat, add the chilli and salt and stir fry for a further minute
| Remove from the heat and allow to cool before serving
