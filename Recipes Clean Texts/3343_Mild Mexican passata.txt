Thickened up more, this makes a good covering for a pizza base.

[[Image:Mild Mexican passata ingredients.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Mild Mexican passata, the ingredients]]
Not really a recipe, just opening a packet, adding a few ingredients and heating them up, although you do need Pasilla chillies which you can probably only get from specialist suppliers.

I made this to go with Mexican fishballs in tomato sauce, which it did, admirably. A great recipe in which to try out any of your dried mild chillies.

The pasilla gave it a really nice bitter chocolaty flavour.

===Ingredients===
| 500g packet or bottle of passata, (about 500 ml)
| 2 or 3 spring onions, chopped
| 1 dried chilli pasilla, deseeded and finely chopped
| 1 large red banana pepper (a normal red bell pepper would be fine)
| A shake of Louisiana hot pepper sauce or Tabasco sauce


===Mise en place===
* Soak the dried pepper in half a cup of boiling water for 15 minutes to rehydrate it
===Method===


| Add all of the ingredients to a pan and heat through.  Add a little extra water if it looks too thick for your recipe.
| As I had plenty of time when I made this, I did not rehydrate the chilli first. I crushed the dried pasilla chilli, discarded the seeds, added everything to a pan, heated it up, left it for an hour or two and then reheated to serve.
