[[Image:Moro crispbread buttered.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Glistening with butter]]
The wonderful idea comes from Sam & Sam Clark who run the [http://www.moro.co.uk/ Moro restaurant], whom I had the pleasure to meet a while back.

Try this out, you won't believe how good it is.

===Ingredients===
| 25g butter
| 2 pitta breads (brown or white)
===Method===


| Preheat the oven to 180\u00b0 C( 350\u00b0 F/Gas 4)
| Melt the butter in a pan over a very low heat
| Split the pittas in half lengthwise (so each pitta is two sheets)
| Butter both sides
| Cut in half again (so you now have 8 half-moon shaped breads)
| Place on a tray in the middle of the oven for 10-15 minutes
| Remove and cool.
===Serving suggestions===

Serve with any dip
