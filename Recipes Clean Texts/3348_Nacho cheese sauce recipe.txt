===Description===

A nice spicy cheese sauce.  We make cheese sauce on a weekly basis using Taste Sensation Matured Cheese powder; my new addition to their range will make a nice spicy variation.
===Ingredients===

| 40g Taste Sensation Nacho Cheese Seasoning
| 40g Salted Butter
| 20g plain flour
| 400ml milk (Semi Skimmed)

===Method===


| Gradually add the milk to the Taste Sensation Nacho Cheese Seasoning, stirring until all the milk has absorbed the seasoning.
| Melt the butter in a saucepan.
| Stir in the flour and cook for 1-2 minutes.
| Take the pan off the heat and gradually stir in one- third of the milk and nacho seasoning blend.
| Return to the heat and simmer, stirring, until the milk blend is absorbed.
| Repeat this process, stirring all the time, allowing the sauce to become thick and shiny before adding more of the milk blend.
| When the entire milk blend is added bring to the boil. Simmer gently for 2-3 minutes and season to taste with salt and pepper.
