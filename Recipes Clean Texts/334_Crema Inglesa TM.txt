===Description===

This is a translation of a recipe in '''Salsas y Ali\u00f1os con Thermomix (Susaeta Ediciones)''' and is very similar to custard.

===Ingredients===TM
| 300g milk
| 3 egg yolks
| 75g icing sugar
| A few drops of vanilla essence
===Method===


| Add the ingredients to the TM and cook '''8 minutes / 90\u00b0 / Speed 4'''.
| The result should be a light sauce, but a little creamy.
| Pour it into a bowl and keep stirring with a wooden spoon until it has completely cooled, to avoid it forming a skin.
===Serving suggestions===
This is similar to the custard used in pastries but is much lighter and less dense.  It has many uses:  use it to decorate dishes and also a basis for ice creams and mousses. 
===Variations===
It can be made with different flavours by adding chocolate, caramel, coffee etc to the milk.  
===Chef's Notes===
To save stirring the sauce for ages, just cover it with cling-film to prevent skin formation.
