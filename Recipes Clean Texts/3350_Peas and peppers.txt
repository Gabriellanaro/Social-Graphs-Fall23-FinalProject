It's a bit of a cheek to even call this a recipe as it's so simple.  Anyway, if you want a simple vegatable side dish with colour, this it.

===Ingredients===
| 200 g (7 oz) Frozen peas (frozen weight)
| 1 red bell pepper
| salt and freshly ground black pepper
| A knob of butter
| Chopped zest of lime, but not too much
===Method===


| Skin the red pepper as shown here
| De-seed the pepper and slice it thinly
| Microwave the peas for 3 or 4 minutes
| You may want to pop the peppers in for the last minute if they have cooled down too much
| Melt the butter in a small pan, add the peas, peppers and lime zest
| Stir well, season and serve
===Serving suggestions===

Serve hot
