Hominy was hard to get hold of though.

A rich, heart-warming soup from Jalisco, Mexico, for which you will need dried hominy. The Cool chili co sell this if you are have difficulty finding it in the Uk.

===Ingredients===
| 2 tablespoons olive oil
| 1 onion, peeled and chopped
| 5 cloves of Garlic, peeled and crushed
| 450 g (1 lb) pork tenderloin fillet, cut into small cubes
| ¼ teaspoon pepper
| Chicken stock or water
| 1 teaspoon freshly ground cumin
| ½ teaspoon dried oregano
| 3 cloves, ground
| 5 fresh chillies, de-seeded and chopped into rings
| 2 cups dried hominy
| ½ teaspoon salt


===Mise en place===
* Re-constitute the dried hominy by soaking overnight in lightly salted water.
===Method===


| On a high heat, add the oil to a large saucepan and brown the meat in small batches, remove and reserve
| Add the ground pepper to the oil, reduce the heat and gently simmer the onions and garlic until translucent, about 5 minutes
| Add enough stock or water to cover the meat by at least 5cm (2\")
| Add the remaining ingredients and simmer, covered, for about 2 hours, topping up with stock or water if necessary.
| Season to taste with salt and extra pepper if required.
===Variations===
For extra flavour and to bulk out the soup, add 1/4 of a cabbage, finely chopped after the first hour of cooking.
