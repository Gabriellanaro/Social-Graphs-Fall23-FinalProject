===Description===

A pupusa is a stuffed corn-tortilla, usually served with a spicy coleslaw called curtido.

Pupusas are hand-made and thick. Like all corn tortillas, they are made using masa harina.  They originate from El Salvador. 

This is not true to the original which uses pork rinds.  This slightly healthier version is stuffed with a bacon tomato and green pepper mixture

===Ingredients===
| 8 rashers bacon
| 2 cloves garlic, crushed
| 4 tomatoes
| 1 green bell pepper
| Ghee or olive oil for frying
===Method===


| Fry the crushed garlic for a minute in the hot ghee or oil
| Fry the bacon until cooked, but not crisp
| deseed and finely chop the green pepper
| Grind or blend the bacon and tomatoes into a rough paste
| Stir in the chopped peppers
| Make the tortillas as shown here, but don't cook them yet
| Divide the mixture into balls, slightly larger than golf-balls and place each ball in the centre of the tortilla and press the mixture out, leaving a gap around the edge
| Cover with another tortilla and press together to seal
| Heat a griddle pan or heavy frying pan and wipe over with a lightly oiled kitchen towel
| Cook each  pupusa until it is nicely toasted.  This will take about 4 minutes a side
| Keep warm while you cook the remaining pupusas
===Serving suggestions===

Serve with curtido
===Variations===

Make the pupusas with a combination of this, refried beans and the filling for Cheese pupusas
