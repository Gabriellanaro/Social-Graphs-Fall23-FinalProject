===Description===

A tangy dip, strongly flavoured with herbs that goes well with fish and meat and would be a good addition to a barbecue.  Don't bother making this with dried herbs!

===Ingredients===
| Handful of fresh parsley
| Handful of fresh basil
| 6 tinned anchovies
| 2 tablespoons capers, chopped
| 1 tablespoon sesame seeds
| 2 garlic cloves, crushed
| 1 tablespoon sherry vinegar
| 1 tablespoon white wine vinegar
| 1 slice of white bread, crusts removed, broken into pieces
| Salt and freshly ground black pepper
| 150 ml extra virgin olive oil
===Method===


| Remove and discard the stems from the parsley
| Add all of the ingredients except for the olive oil and the sesame seeds and blitz in a food processor until finely chopped
| Slowly add the olive oil until you have a thick sauce
| Mix in the sesame seeds
| Season to taste with salt and black pepper
===Serving suggestions===

This will keep refrigerated for a day or so.

Try this with fried monkfish in monkfish salsa verde
