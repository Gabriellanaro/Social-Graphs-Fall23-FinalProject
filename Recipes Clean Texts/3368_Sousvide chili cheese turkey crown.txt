Last week we did beef in this marinade and it was better than the turkey.

 

 The Judge 
===Description===

Sounds weird, but I assure you, it's fabulous.

If the flavours disturb you, then just leave the spices out and make it with just sage and onion.

I've found that it's cooked perfectly well after 5 hours, but I like to leave it for about ten hours so the flavours penetrate properly.  It won't dry out during the extended cooking time if it's cooked sous-vide. This is probably the most succulent way we've found to cook turkey.
===Ingredients===

| 1 medium frozen Turkey Crown 
| 1 onion
| Bunch of sage leaves
| A sprig of fresh thyme leaves
| 2 tablespoons of Taste Sensation Chili Cheese marinade
===Mise en place===

* Thoroughly defrost the turkey crown in a cool place.

===Method===


| Peel and chop the onion
| Wash and dry the fresh herbs
| Add the chopped onion, herbs and Taste Sensation Chili Cheese Marinade Powder to the sous-vide bag
| Carefully rinse the turkey crown in warm water and pat dry with paper towels
| Using poultry shears or good scissors, remove and discard the flap of fatty skin at the rear of the bird, where the Parson's nose was.
| Add the turkey crown to the sous-vide bag and shake well to allow the spices and herbs to be evenly distributed throughout.
| Vacuum seal and cook in the sous-vide bath for 10 hours at 67\u00b0 C
| Serve immediately, no need to rest the bird when it's cooked this way.
| The juices make a nice spicy gravy when added 50/50 to chicken gravy granules ðŸ˜ˆ.

===Serving suggestions===
On the day of cooking, we like to serve the turkey as a roast with all the trimmings.  The second and third days, it's lovely with a salad or in pittas.
===Variations===
Slice up a whole leak and add it to the sous-vide bag with lots of herbs so the flavours permeate the turkey.
