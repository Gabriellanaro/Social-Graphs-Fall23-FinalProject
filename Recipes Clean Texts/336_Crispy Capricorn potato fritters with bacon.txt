These are nicer than cheesey-chips!

I think that this light snack recipe from The Lubborn Creamery would make an excellent breakfast, though it's probably a little optimistic to expect it to stretch to 4 people!

===Ingredients===
| 2 medium eggs, beaten
| 25g (1oz) plain flour
| 2 tablespoons snipped fresh chives
| 750g floury potatoes, peeled and coarsely grated
| 1 small onion, grated
| 1 x 100g Capricorn Somerset Goats cheese, finely diced
| olive oil to fry
===Method===


| Mix the eggs and flour together in a bowl to form a thick batter. Stir in the chives and plenty of seasoning.
| Squeeze the excess liquid out of the grated potatoes and onion then spread them out on a clean tea-towel and pat dry.
| Stir into the batter, mixing well, then add the Capricorn Somerset Goats cheese.
| Heat a little olive oil in a frying pan and add 6 tablespoons of batter, pressing down each one to flatten it out. Cook for 2 Â½-3 mins each side until golden.
| Keep warm while you cook the remaining batter, adding extra oil as needed.
===Serving suggestions===
Serve with crispy bacon and grilled tomatoes.
===Chef's notes===
Follow the RSPCA Think Pig Checklist to make sure that your pork has come from pigs that have been reared to higher welfare standards.
