I just don't like sweet potatoes, in any form.  Not for me \ud83d\udd74\ud83d\udd74\ud83d\udd74
 

The Judge 

A really fresh tasting salsa that is really colourful with the dazzling orange of the sweet potatoes and the sharp tangy cut of the lime.  Good with grilled fish as well as grilled chicken or pork.

===Ingredients===
| 675 g (1½ lb) sweet potatoes 
| 1/2 a teaspoon of crushed dried chilies
| 4 spring onions, finely chopped
| Juice of ¾ of an orange
| Juice of ¾ of a small lime
| Finely chopped zest from ¼ of a lime
| Pinch of sea salt
===Method===


| Peel the sweet potatoes and dice to 1 cm (½\") cubes
| Add the cubes to a pan of boiling water and boil for 10 minutes
| Drain and return to the pan for another 5 minutes, covered but unheated, to allow the potatoes to dry out
| Add the dried sweet potatoes to a serving bowl and chill in the refrigerator for 20 minutes
| Mix the orange, lime juice, crushed chillies and spring onions together
| When ready to serve, toss the sweet potatoes in the juice mix, season with sea salt and serve
