===Description===

A really fresh tasting salsa that is really colourful with the dazzling orange of the sweet potatoes and the sharp tangy cut of the lime.

===Ingredients===
| 675 g (1½ lb) sweet potatoes 
| 1/2 a teaspoon of crushed dried chilies
| 4 spring onions, finely chopped
| Juice of ¾ of an orange
| Juice of ¾ of a small lime
| Finely chopped zest from ¼ of a lime
| Pinch of sea salt
===Method===


| Peel the sweet potatoes and dice to 1 cm (½\") cubes
| Add the cubes to a pan of boiling water and boil for 10 minutes
| Drain and return to the pan for another 5 minutes, covered but unheated, to allow the potatoes to dry out
| Add the dried sweet potatoes to a serving bowl and chill in the refrigerator for 20 minutes
| Mix the orange, lime juice, crushed chillies and spring onions together
| When ready to serve, toss the sweet potatoes in the juice mix, season with sea salt and serve
