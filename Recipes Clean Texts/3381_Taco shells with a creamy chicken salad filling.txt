===Description===

We love taco shells and I'm always looking for different ways to use them.  Watching Jamie Oliver's 'Comfort Food' recently, I thought the salad dressing for his 'Insanity Burger' looked interesting so I thought I would try it as a taco shell filling.  It was fabulous. We're having it again tonight!

===Ingredients===

| 140g cooked chicken pieces
| 10 taco shells
| Half a sweet pepper (pick your favourite colour)
| Half a small white onion, finely chopped (or a few spring onions)
| 1 carrot, peeled and julienned with an Oxo Good Grips Julienne peeler
| 3 small tomatoes, quartered
==== for the creamy salad dressing====
===Ingredients===NB
| 3 tablespoons mayonnaise
| 1 tablespoon tomato ketchup
| 1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
| 1 teaspoon Tabasco sauce or my favourite, Louisiana Hot Pepper Sauce
| 1 teaspoon brandy
| 1/3 of an Iceberg lettuce, finely chopped

===Method===


| Add the mayonnaise, tomato ketchup, tabasco, Worcestershire sauce and brandy to a serving bowl and mix well.
| Finely chop the Iceberg lettuce and mix into the salad dressing.
| Prepare all the remaining items and place on small serving dishes.
| Microwave the taco shells for 30 seconds or place in a warm oven for 5 minutes.
| Lay everything out on the table and help yourself!
===Variations===
Turkey left-overs would work well in this
