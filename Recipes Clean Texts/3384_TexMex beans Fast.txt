===Description===

A really quick accompaniment for any Tex-Mex meal.  Kids will love them.  If you have not made any Tex-Mex seasoning, then just use a tablespoon of El Paso taco seasoning, store the rest for another time in a screwtop jar.

===Ingredients===
| 1 tin baked beans
| 1 tablespoon Tex-Mex seasoning
| 1 teaspoon butter
===Method===


| Mix all the ingredients together in a small pan and heat gently.
| Alternatively, add to a bowl, mix well and microwave for 3 minutes
