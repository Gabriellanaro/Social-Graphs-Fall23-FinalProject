===Description===


A great starter, side-dish or mezze, this dip is great for dipping tortilla chips or strips of raw vegetables.

===Ingredients===
| 1 400g can pinto beans or flageolet beans, rinsed and drained
| 6 pickled jalape\u00f1o slices
| 1 tablespoon of the vinegar from the jar of pickled jalape\u00f1o slices
| ½ teaspoon fine sea salt
| ½ teaspoon sugar
| ¼ teaspoons paprika powder (un-smoked)
| ¼ teaspoons onion powder
| ½ teaspoon garlic powder
| ¼ teaspoon chilli powder
===Method===


| Add all of the ingredients to a food processor with a metal blade
| Blend until smooth
| Chill for 1 hour before serving
===Serving suggestions===
Serve as a dip to accompany tortilla chips or raw vegetables.
===Chef's notes===
Almost any cooked canned beans would do for this recipe, apart from baked beans, that is!  I used borlotti beans.

Go easy adding the vinegar, too much vinegar is too much!
