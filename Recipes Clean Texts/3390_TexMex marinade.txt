===Description===


This is great as a marinade for chicken pieces, cubes of steak for kebabs and beef ribs and especially good for barbecues.

Coat the meat in the marinade, refrigerate for a few hours and barbecue.

===Fabulous commercial alternative===
If your feeling lazy and want a really good, high quality commercial Tex Mex Glaze Dry Rub, I promise that you won't get better than Taste Sensations own brand.  It's mainly sold to caterers, but they produce pack sizes as small as 250g for less than \u00a34 and you can buy it directly from [https://www.amazon.co.uk/stores/TasteSensation/node/4434351031 Amazon].  That amount just about fits in to a 500ml Kilner-type jar and get used surprisingly quickly. I don't make my own anymore!

===Ingredients===
| 1 tablespoon olive oil
| 1 garlic clove, crushed
| 1 teaspoon black mustard seeds, crushed
| ½ teaspoon freshly ground white cumin seeds
| ½ teaspoon freshly ground coriander seeds
| 1 teaspoon paprika powder
| ½ teaspoon sea salt
| 1 teaspoon fresh oregano leaves or ½ teaspoon dried oregano leaves
| ½ teaspoon chili powder
| ½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
===Method===


| Mix everything together.
===Serving suggestions===

Use as a marinade for beef or chicken when preparing Mexican-style dishes. 
===Servings===
Enough to marinate meat for 4
