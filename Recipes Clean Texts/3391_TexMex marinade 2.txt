Fabulous stuff

===Description===

This is great as a marinade for chicken pieces, cubes of steak for kebabs and beef ribs and especially good for barbecues.

Coat the meat in the marinade, refrigerate for a few hours and then barbecue or grill.

===Fabulous commercial alternative===
If your feeling lazy and want a really good, high quality commercial Tex Mex Glaze Dry Rub, I promise that you won't get better than Taste Sensation's own brand.  It's mainly sold to caterers, but they produce pack sizes as small as 250g for less than \u00a34 and you can buy it directly from [https://www.amazon.co.uk/stores/TasteSensation/node/4434351031 Amazon].  That amount just about fits in to a 500ml Kilner-type jar and get used surprisingly quickly. I don't make my own anymore!

===Ingredients===
| 3 ancho chillies
| 3 tablespoons dried oregano or marjoram
| 3 tablespoons dried thyme
| Juice of 1 lime
| Juice of ½ an orange
| A pinch of grated lime zest
| A pinch of grated orange zest
| ½ small onion, peeled and sliced
| 2 cloves of garlic
| 4 tablespoons of olive oil
===Method===


| Remove the seeds and stalks from the ancho chillies
| Add to a small bowl and just cover with boiling water, leave to soak for 3 minutes
| Blend the remaining ingredients and the ancho chillies in a food processor using as much of the soaking liquor as is required to make a pourable marinade
===Serving suggestions===

Use as a marinade for beef or chicken when preparing Mexican style dishes.
