[[Image:Tex-Mex potato wedges marinade.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Coated and ready to cook]]
The healthier alternative to chips.  Kids love them and don't realise they're missing their chips.  Served with a salsa or sour cream they also make a very good starter.

If you have not made your own Tex-Mex seasoning, then a packet of El Paso Taco Seasoning Mix will do fine - use 2 tablespoons, not the whole packet. The rest will keep in an airtight container.

===Ingredients===
| 2 tablespoons Tex-Mex seasoning
| 2 large baking potatoes, unpeeled - see Chef's notes below.
| 2 tablespoons olive oil
| 2 tablespoons peanut oil (groundnut oil)
===Method===


| Preheat the oven to  220\u00b0 C (400\u00b0 F - Gas 6)
| Cut the potatoes into wedges 2.5 cm (1\") wide
| Add the potato wedges and both oils to a bowl
| Sprinkle the seasoning over the wedges and with your hands, mix really well to coat the wedges
| Place on the preheated baking tray and cook for  20 to 25  minutes or until golden - check them regularly
| Drain on kitchen paper, serve.
===Serving suggestions===

Serve immediately

===Variations===

Plain potato wedges, prepare the same way, just omit the Taco seasoning.
===Chef's notes===
The best potatoes for making potato wedges are: Cara, Estima, King Edwards, Marfona, Maris Piper or Vivaldi.
