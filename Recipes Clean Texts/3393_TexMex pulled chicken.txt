===Description===

''\"If this is only half as good as our pulled pork recipe, it will be brilliant.\"''

Well, not a quite as good as pulled pork, but very tasty, and it went a long way. Using a medium chicken and lots of home made salsa it would probably stretch to 6 people.  I added crushed new potatoes to the wrap, just because we had some spare - that helped to bulk it out and made it a little different.

===Ingredients===
| 2 tablespoons olive oil
| 1 onion, peeled and sliced
| 2 Cloves of garlic, peeled and crushed
| 1 teaspoon white cumin seeds ground to powder
| ½ teaspoon chilli powder (or to taste)
| ½ teaspoon mustard powder
| ½ teaspoon garlic powder
| ½ teaspoon ginger powder
| 1 teaspoon coriander seeds, ground to powder
| 1 teaspoon of paprika powder, smoked paprika powder is even better if you have it.
| Pinch of ground cinnamon powder
|* Note to self: go easy on the cinnamon!
| 1kg chicken pieces for four people, skin removed - one medium 1.3kg chicken, jointed, is ideal.
| sea salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
| 2 teaspoons of muscovado sugar or brown sugar
| 190 ml (3/4 cup) cup of tomato salsa, you can make your own here but bottled salsa is still pretty good
| 250 ml (1 cup) chicken stock
| Juice and zest of ½ a lime
===Method===


| Heat the olive oil in a pan and gently saut\u00e9 the onion and garlic until it is translucent - about 6 minutes
| Add the spices and stir-fry for a few minutes
| Mix in the chicken, salsa brown sugar and chicken stock, bring to the boil then reduce to a simmer
| Cover and cook for 40 minutes then remove the chicken pieces from the pot and allow to cool a little
| Leave the cover off the pan and continue simmering the sauce until it is reduced by more than half and most of the sauce has gone - probably another 30 minutes.
| Meanwhile use 2 forks and shred the meat from the bones
| Once the sauce has reduced, add back the chicken, mix in the lime juice and zest and season to taste

===Serving suggestions===
Serve on tortillas or similar flat breads
Garnish with avocado slices, slices of lime, soured cream and salad leaves
===Variations===
This makes a great sandwich filler too.
===Chef's notes===
As I almost invariably do after jointing a chicken, I cut slashes all over the chicken pieces; refrigerate and marinade them in the juice of a lime and a big pinch of salt.  It's a habit picked up from an Indian cookery course that seems to make chicken very tender and tasty.
