This beats the (expensive) commercially made Tex Mex mixes, hands down.

===Description===

Rather than buying packets of Mexican spice mix from that well known company, make your own.  It's easy, allows you to tailor it to your taste.  The recipe is easy to adjust to make different quantities.

The Main ingredients that give that authentic flavour are the oregano, cumin seeds and chili powder.  I would suggest you keep those at the levels here and adjust the other items if you have a desire to tinker.

Everything is in teaspoons to make it easy to make different quantities - use tablespoons at the same rate to make more.
===Commercially available Tex-Mex seasoning===
I also use ready made seasoning mixes, but the one I had been using changed and was far too salty so I went in search of another supplier.  This let to my discovery of Taste Sensation Ltd.  if you love your spices and seasonings, take a look at them.  They sell them directly and via [https://www.amazon.co.uk/stores/TasteSensation/node/4434351031 Amazon UK] and I can thoroughly recommend them.  Also, Nick Lumby, who has run the company for 20 years, is a really nice guy!

===Ingredients===
| 2 teaspoons chili powder or chili flakes or crushed dried chillies
| 2 teaspoons paprika powder
| 2 teaspoons dried Mexican oregano or oregano leaves
| 3 teaspoons dried garlic granules or garlic powder
| 1 teaspoon sea salt
| 6 teaspoons white cumin seeds
| 5 teaspoons onion powder or dried onion flakes

===Method===


| Grind all the ingredients to powder in a coffee grinder
| Mix together well if you had to do this in batches
===Chef's notes===

Store in an airtight container out of the light.

35 g of this spice mix is sufficient to season; chicken, pork, beef for four people.  Rub the mix on the meat, coat well with a tablespoon of vegetable oil and 1 tablespoon lemon juice and marinate for 2 hours.

I've recently discovered Old India Taco Seasoning, which saves me from makling this.  It's sold in 500g quantities, which last us about 4 months!  Wonderful stuff.  Give it a try.

A good Asian grocer / wholesaler will stock all of the ingredients for this recipe, and a whole lot more besides!
