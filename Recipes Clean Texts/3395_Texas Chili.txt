===Description===

This is a 1st place winner in an annual North Texas Chili Cook off.
===Ingredients===

| 6 dried Ancho chile peppers (about 1 \u00be ounces), stems and seeds removed, and flesh torn into 1-inch pieces 
| 2 dried Arbol chile peppers, stems removed, pods split, seeds removed 
| 3 tablespoons cornmeal
| 2 teaspoons dried oregano
| 2 teaspoons ground cumin
| 2 teaspoons unsweetened cocoa powder
| 2.5 cups low-sodium chicken broth
| 3 tablespoons vegetable oil
| 2 medium onions, cut into 3/4-inch pieces (about 2 cups) 
| 3 small Jalapeno chilies, stems and seeds removed and discarded, flesh cut into \u00bd-inch pieces
| 4 medium garlic cloves, minced or pressed through garlic press (about 4 teaspoons)
| 2 (14 \u00bd ounce) can diced tomatoes
| 50ml tomato paste
| 2 teaspoons sugar
| 2 teaspoons light molasses
| 4.5 pounds blade steaks, trimmed of gristle and fat and cut into \u00be-inch pieces 
| 1 (12 ounce) bottle lager


===Mise en place===
Preheat the oven to 150\u00b0 C (300\u00b0 F - gas 2), [fan oven 130\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]
===Method===



| Place Ancho chilies in 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat; toast, stirring frequently, until flesh is dry and fragrant, 4-6 minutes, reducing heat if chilies begin to smoke. 
| Transfer to bowl of food processor and cool. Do not wash out skillet.
| Add Arbol chilies, cornmeal, oregano, cumin, cocoa, and 1 teaspoon salt to food processor with toasted Ancho chilies; process until finely ground, about 2 minutes. With processor running, very slowly add \u00bd cup broth until smooth, thick paste forms, about 45 seconds, scraping down sides of bowl as necessary. Transfer to small bowl. Place onions in now-empty processor bowl and pulse until roughly chopped, about four 1-second pulses. Add jalapenos and pulse until consistency of chunky salsa, about four 1-second pulses, scraping down bowl as necessary.
| Heat 1 tablespoon oil in large dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add onion mixture and cook, stirring occasionally, until any exuded moisture has evaporated and vegetables are softened, 7 to 9 minutes. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add chili paste, tomatoes, tomato paste, sugar and molasses; stir until chili paste is thoroughly combined. Add remaining 2 cups broth; bring to boil then reduce heat to simmer.
| Meanwhile, heat 1 tablespoon oil in 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat. Pat beef dry with paper towels and sprinkle with 1 teaspoon salt. Add half of beef and cook until browned on all sides, about 8 minutes. Transfer meat to dutch oven. Add \u00bd bottle lager to skillet, scraping bottom of pan to loosen any browned bits, and bring to simmer. Transfer lager to Dutch oven. Repeat with remaining oil, beef, and lager. Once last addition of lager has been added to dutch oven, stir to combine and return mixture to simmer. 
| Cover pot and transfer to oven. Cook until meat is fully tender, 1 \u00bd to 2 hours. Let chili stand, uncovered, for 10 minutes. Stir well and season to taste with salt.
