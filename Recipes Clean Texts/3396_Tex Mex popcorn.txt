===Description===

Yet another variation on the popular snack.

I first got the urge to try flavoured popcorn when watching a long forgotten cartoon; as mummy dragon was about to go shopping, she warned the two baby dragons not to make garlic popcorn whilst she was gone.  Guess what I did next!

===Ingredients===
| 1.5 litres warm freshly popped corn
| 1 teaspoon ground chili powder
| 1 teaspoon paprika powder
| 1 teaspoon freshly ground white cumin powder
| Â½ teaspoon freshly ground black cumin powder 
| 150 g (5 oz) grated cheddar cheese
===Method===


| Put the popcorn in a large bowl
| Shake the seasoning over the popcorn and mix well
| Sprinkle the grated cheese into the bowl and mix again
===Serving suggestions===

Serve hot
