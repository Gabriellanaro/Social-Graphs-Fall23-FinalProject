===Description===

Make this salsa when you need it, it's nice and zingy when fresh.

Play about with the ingredients to suit your taste

===Ingredients===
| 2  onions ,finely chopped
| 2 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed
| 3 peeled and seeded tomatoes, unless, like me, you have better things to do than peel and de-seed tomatoes!
| 1 teaspoon brown sugar
| 4 tablespoons of chopped coriander
| 6 tablespoons of chopped parsley
| 50 ml white wine vinegar
| Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
===Method===


| Finely chop the onions and tomatoes and add to a serving bowl
| Add the rest of the ingredients apart from the herbs to another bowl and leave for 30 minutes or more to infuse.
| Add the herbs to the tomatoes and toss in the dressing
===Serving suggestion===

Serve chilled

===Variations===

Use a bunch of spring onions instead of onions.  Add any suitable ''fridge forage'' that can be found.
