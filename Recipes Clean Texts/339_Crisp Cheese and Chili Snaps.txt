===Crisp Cheese and Chili Snaps===
Well I seem to remember my mum saying the art of a good cook is to be able to recover from a failure - well Mum, this is what I've made from my first (failed) attempt at making Squeezy cheese cookies.

These are very good, though I've eaten too many while they were still hot and soft so I'll suffer later!
===Ingredients===

| 150 g [5 oz - 1.5 cups] plain flour
| ¼ teaspoon chili powder
| ¼ teaspoon smoked paprika powder
| ½ teaspoon sea salt
| 60 g [2.5 oz] butter cut into small cubes
| 225 g [8 oz] strong Cheddar cheese, roughly grated
===Mise en place===

* Preheat your oven to 190\u00b0 C (375\u00b0 F - gas 5), [fan oven 170\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]
* Ensure the cheese and butter are at room temperature

===Method===


| Add the dry ingredients to a food processor with a metal blade and pulse until combined.
| Add the butter and cheese and mix until it separates into small balls.  Don't over mix.
| Tip into a bowl and knead with your hands to combine into a pliable dough.
| Wrap the dough in cling-film and allow to rest for 30 minutes at room temperature.
| You can refrigerate at this stage and bake the cheese cookies later.  If you do this, allow the dough to get back to room temperature.
| Roll the dough out to form a tube and cut into fairly thin slices, about 2 mm is good, this way they are lovely and crisp once you allow them to cool.
| Lay the slices on a non-greased baking tray 
| Bake in the middle of the oven for 12 to 14 minutes or until the edges begin to brown
| Remove from the baking tray with a metal spatula and leave to cool on a rack.
