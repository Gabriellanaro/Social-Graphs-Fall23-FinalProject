===Description===


These tortilla pots, tortilla baskets are easy to prepare and make fantastic edible bowls which enhances the appearance (and taste) of any meal.

This cooking process works just as well with soft flour wheat flour tortilla wraps as it does with soft yellow cornmeal tortilla wraps.

The idea is really simple, spray or brush the tortilla, shape it into a greased bowl and back it in the oven.  This hardens it  an turns it into a large crispy edible taco!

You must use an oven-proof bowl and you may have to experiment to find the bowl that produces the best shape.  I've found that  a small and a medium glass pyrex bowl work really well.

Fill them with the food of your choice, you'll find them to be much stronger than you might imagine.

===Ingredients===

| 1 pack of soft wheat flour tortilla wraps or soft cornmeal tortilla wraps.
| Olive oil for spraying for brushing
===Mise en place===

* Preheat the oven to 200\u00b0 C (400\u00b0 F - gas 6), [fan oven 180\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]

===Method===


| Lightly spray or brush your oven-proof bowls so the tortilla wrap doesn't stick once it has been baked.
| Lightly spray the top surface of the tortilla with a little olive oil, not too much.
| Push the tortilla into your bowl so it makes a 'useful' shape.
| Bake the tortillas, in the bowls for 6 minutes or until they start to colour.
| Watch them closely as the time between browning and burning is really short!
| Carefully remove the bowls from the oven and invert them over paper towels and knock the shaped tortilla out onto the paper towels.
| They remain soft and pliable while they are still hot so leave them upside down for 15 minutes or so to cool and harden, ready for use.
| If like me, you don't have enough bowls, you can make these in batches, they keep pretty well for a day or so.
