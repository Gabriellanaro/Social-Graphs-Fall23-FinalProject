===Description===

A great fish salad / ceviche recipe for those hot summer evenings when you don't want to cook.

===Ingredients===
| 200g best quality fresh tuna steak (sashimi quality)
| Zest and juice from 2 limes
| Thumb-sized piece of ginger, peeled and finely grated
| 1 fresh red chilli - finely chopped - seeds removed if preferred
| ½ teaspoon light soy sauce
| 2 spring onions, finely chopped
| 1 ripe avocado, peeled, stoned and cut into thin slices
===Method===


| Cut the tuna into 5 mm (¼\u0094) cubes
| Add the tuna and the remaining ingredients to a Lock and Lock-style box
| Close the lid - shake like mad and refrigerate for 3 hours - shaking now and then
| Taste, adjust the seasoning and serve over the avocado slices.
===Serving suggestions===
* Serve in a Martini glass for that 'dinner party' look
* To serve as 'finger food', spoon small amounts onto trimmed green salad leaves
===Variations===
Use a grapefruit or an orange instead of 2 limes

Use a small, finely chopped red onion instead of a spring onion
