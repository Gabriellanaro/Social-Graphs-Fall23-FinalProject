The are cheap to buy, but not expensive and much nicer when homemade.

We also have a good recipe for corn tortillas that uses masa harina for that real authentic taste.

===Ingredients===
| 800 g plain flour, sifted.
| Â½ teaspoon salt.
| 100 ml hand-hot water
| 100 g Vegetable shortening
===Method===


| Rub the flour, salt and shortening together unti it resembles fine breadcrumbs.
| Little by little add the water and mix to a dough.
| Cover with a damp cloth and leave for 20 minutes.
| Divide into golf-ball sized balls or slightly larger.
| Roll out on a floured worktop.
| Cook for about a minute on a hot tava or griddle pan until they puff up.
===Chef's notes===
Vegetable shortening is a solid vegetable fat such as Crisco or Trex.  Lard could be used without any problems but the recipe would no longer be vegetarian.
===Chef's note===
If you don't have a tortilla press, use 2 chopping boards or just two sheets of wood as a substitute.  Place ball of dough between two non-stick surfaces such as small squares of Bake-O-Glide and stand on them!
