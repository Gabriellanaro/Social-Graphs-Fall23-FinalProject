===Description===

[[Image:Yellow rice (Mexican) ingredients.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Yellow rice - The ingredients]]
An unusual rice dish that uses ground achiote seeds (annatto powder) to colour it.  Although it's a Mexican dish, it would work in place of any rice dish.

===Ingredients===
| 200g (7 oz) long grain rice
| 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
| 1 teaspoon ground achiote seeds (annatto powder)
| 1 small onion, finely chopped
| 2 garlic cloves, crushed
| 475 ml (16 fl oz) good vegetable or chicken stock
| 50 g (2 oz) pickled jalepeno chili slices
| sea salt
| Fresh coriander leaves, chopped
===Method===


| In a sieve, rinse the rice for a few minutes under cold running water  to remove excess starch.  The water should run clear once done
| Heat the oil in a pan and fry the onion and garlic for 4 minutes until soft and translucent
| Add the annatto powder and fry for a further 3 minutes
| Mix the rice into the onion mix and stir well to coat all of the rice
| Add the stock, bring to the boil and simmer, covered, for 25 minutes or until the rice has absorbed all of the liquid.  A sheet or so of tin-foil under the pan lid helps to make a good seal
| Add extra water if the rice dries out before it's cooked
| Add the chopped chillies and add salt to taste
===Serving suggestions===

Serve in a large bowl, garnished with coriander leaves

===Variations===

Serve cold as a salad.

If you don't want to add chillies, try some sliced roasted red peppers instead.
