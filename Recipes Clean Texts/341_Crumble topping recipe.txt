I much prefer home-made crumble, it can be made less sweet (for my taste) and it's easy to add your own spices and flavours.

===Description===

This recipe is for a basic fruit crumble topping commonly used to cover cooked fruit.  I have created this recipe separately as Mum wanted me to make her some crumble on its own!

As a basic rule use 4 parts flour, to 2 parts butter and 2 parts sugar, using less sugar as taste demands.

===Ingredients===
| 285g (10½ oz) plain flour
| 150g (5oz) butter (preferably unsalted) at room temperature, cut into small cubes.  
|* Stork margarine is also good for this recipe.
| 150g (5oz)  unrefined brown sugar, Muscovado etc.
| Pinch of cinnamon powder or ginger powder
===Mise en place===
* Preheat the oven to 180\u00b0 C (350\u00b0 F - gas 4)
===Method===


|By hand
| Sift the plain flour into a large bowl and sprinkle with sugar, salt and spices if using.
| With 'light-hands', gradually rub the butter into the flour a few cubes at a time until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs
| Don't over-work it or it will become a useless dough.
| With a food processor
| Add the flour and butter to a food processor with a plastic blade attachment
| Pulse the mixture in very short bursts, regularly opening and scraping any residue from the edge of the bowl if as it forms
| Once it resembles breadcrumbs sprinkle in the sugar and pulse until combined.
| Don't run it continuously or you will end up with pastry
| Break up any lumps with your fingers before sprinkling and baking.
| Normally you would spoon this mixture over the fruit, if, unusually, you are making it on its own, sprinkle over a lightly buttered 24 cm (9\") oven-proof dish
| Bake in the oven for 35 to 40 minutes - keep your eye on it for the last 10 minutes, the transition time between done and burnt is short!

===Variations===
Depending upon your taste, use less sugar. This recipe is fairly sweet for my taste. 

For a nice change, add a little rolled oats for cornflakes to the mixture before baking.
