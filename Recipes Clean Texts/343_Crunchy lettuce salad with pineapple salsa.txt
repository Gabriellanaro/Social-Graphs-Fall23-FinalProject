===Description===

I made a pineapple salsa to go with roast duck legs and it was so good that we made it the next day and added it to lettuce and red peppers to make a fragrant, crunchy salad.
===Ingredients===

| 1 small tin of pineapple rings (4 rings)
| 1 small red onion, peeled and cut into thin rings
| 2 small fresh chillies, deseeded and chopped into rings
| 1 teaspoon fresh ginger - (Frozen ginger paste is the most economical way to use ginger and still have the zing)
| 1 level teaspoon muscovado sugar
| 20 ml lime juice
| 20 ml olive oil
| Pinch of sea salt
| Half an Iceberg lettuce, chopped
| Half a roasted red pepper, deseeded and chopped

===Method===


| Drain the canned pineapple rings and cut into segments - reserve a little of the juice
| Leave the onions to dress the salsa at the end
| Mix the remaining items together and the flavours to combine
| Taste and add a little of the pineapple juice if needed
| Add the lettuce, red peppers and onion rings to a bowl and toss in the salsa
===Serving suggestions===
Great with roast duck.
