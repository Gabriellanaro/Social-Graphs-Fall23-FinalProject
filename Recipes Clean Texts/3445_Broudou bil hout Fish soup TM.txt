===Description===

This Tunisian soup has been adapted here for the Thermomix.  It is more like a stew, so could also be served as a main course.

| 1 teaspoon harissa 
| Salt, to taste (be careful if you are making the stock with a bouillon cube)
| 500ml fish stock, water or court bouillon
| 1 preserved lemon, finely chopped 
| 3 medium tomatoes, peeled and quartered
| 2 medium potatoes, cut into chunks 
| 1 small bulb fennel, with leaves, chopped
| 650g mixed fish and seafood, skinned, boned, peeled etc and cut into small pieces, if necessary

===Serving suggestions===
Serve with bread.
===Variations===
You can also add 2 tablespoons of capers, 2 tablespoons of caraway seeds and/or 1 teaspoon ground coriander. Use the juice of 1½ lemons instead of the preserved lemons and if you do not have any harissa, substitute it with 1 teaspoon paprika and ½ teaspoon Cayenne pepper. 
===Chef's notes===
Use a mixture of firm fish, eg monkfish, gurnard, bream or bass and some delicate fish, eg whiting, cod or haddock, together with small whole fish, eel chunks, squid, prawns or crabmeat.
