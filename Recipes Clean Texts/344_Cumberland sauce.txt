This sauce, invented, it is said, by the 3rd Duke of Cumberland (or Crown Prince Ernst August II of Hanover, 3rd Duke of Cumberland and Teviotdale, if you want the fully Monty!) is fantastic with duck, pork, gammon, ham, chicken and most game. It can be improved by substituting redcurrant jelly with lingonberry preserve if you can obtain it.

===Ingredients===
| 1 Lemon
| 1 Orange
| 4 heaped tablespoons redcurrant jelly
| 4 tablespoons port
| 1 heaped teaspoon mustard powder
| 1 heaped teaspoon ground ginger
===Method===


| Zest the orange and lemon using a mandoline or a speed peeler and then chopping the zest into smaller pieces, or use a lemon zester, which I never find as quick
| Blanch the zest in freshly boiled water for 5 minutes to lose any bitterness then drain well
| Add the redcurrant jelly or lingonberry preserve to a pan with the port, heat and stir to melt the jelly
| In a bowl, add the mustard, ginger powder and juice of half a lemon and whisk up well
| Add the redcurrant jelly and the juice of an orange and whisk again
| Mix in the zest
===Chef's tip===

Serve at room temperature

===Variations===

Substitute the redcurrant jelly with lingonberry preserve.

Use a lime instead of a lemon.

Use a Seville orange when in season.

===Chef's tip===

Don't try to thicken this sauce as it is supposed to be quite thin.
