A nice mixture of pork sausages and lentils.  Great for a winter day meal.

This is my variation of a recipe from featured in ''Sevenoaks Magazine''.

| 2 teaspoons muscovado sugar
| 2 teaspoons English mustard
| 2 tablespoons sherry vinegar (red wine vinegar will be fine)
| 75 ml vegetable stock
| 4 Cumberland sausages
| 8 rashers pancetta or thin-cut bacon
