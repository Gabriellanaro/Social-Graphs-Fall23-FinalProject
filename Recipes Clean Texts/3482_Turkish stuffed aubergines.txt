===Description===


Karn\u0131yar\u0131k (translated into English as 'it's belly halved'!) is a Turkish style aubergine halved into two and stuffed with mince meat and other tasty ingredients! 
, alongside rice, chips or potatoes

===Ingredients===
| 1 aubergine
| 250g of lamb mince meat
| ½ an onion
| ½ a can of plum peeled tomatoes
| salt
| black pepper
| lemon
| Cheese to garnish


===Mise en place===
* Oven temperature - 200 degrees
===Method===


| Wash the aubergine, dry it well, and cut down the middle into two.
| Scrape out the inside of both parts with a knife, leaving only 1cm all around to the edge, and put the scrapings into a bowl.
| Fry the mince meat for around 10-15 minutes (until cooked).
| FINELY chop ½ and onion, and fry it with the inside scrapings of the aubergine for around 5 minutes.
| Add the mince, add ½ a can of CRUSHED plum peeled tomatoes with some of the juice, add salt, black pepper, and lemon, stir it all and leave to fry for a few minutes.
| Separately, fry the 2 cut pieces of the aubergine on both sides, until it starts to become soft and brown (be careful not to over cook it).
| Put 1 glass of water in an oven tray or pyrex, place the 2 pieces of aubergine in the water, and fill them with the mince and aubergine stuffing.
| Cover the top with another tray or some tin foil, place in a preheated oven of 200 degrees, and leave for around 20 minutes.
| After 20 minutes, take off the tray/foil and leave for another 10-20 minutes, checking that the aubergines become soft but do over cook.
| Finally, grate some mild cheese on top of the aubergines and leave in the oven until it melts. Once it has melted take out of the oven and enjoy!
===Serving suggestions===
Serve with natural yogurt, and alongside rice, chips or potatoes.
