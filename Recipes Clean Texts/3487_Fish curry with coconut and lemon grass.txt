[[Image:Fish curry with coconut and lemon grass wok simmer.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Simmering in the wok]]
This spicy fish curry with a Malaysian influence would probably be cooked using rather expensive monkfish.  We are now converted lovers of basa so I thought I would try using that instead.

If you can get galangal, do give it a try, it is one of the oddest spices that I've ever tried.  I've not yet decided on its flavour, but the perfume is similar to a very sweet bubble-gum, though its many decades since I've tried bubble-gum!

Do try this, whatever fish or spices you decide to use!

===Ingredients===

| 2 basa fillets
| Pinch of salt and freshly ground black pepper.
| Zest and juice of a lime or lemon
| ½ whole coconut, flesh removed and grated 
| 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
| 2.5 cm (1 \") fresh galangal root, peeled and thinly sliced
| 2.5 cm (1\") fresh root ginger, peeled and grated
| 2 red chillies or small green indian chillies, finely chopped, ''see Chef's notes below''.
| 3 cloves of garlic, peeled and crushed
| 5 cm (2\") lemon grass very finely chopped
| 1 tablespoon nam pla
| 200 ml of chicken stock
| 1 400 ml can of coconut milk
| 1 tablespoon jaggery of brown sugar
| ½ teaspoon turmeric powder
| Fresh coriander and chopped red chilies to garnish

===Method===


| Chop the fish into large bite-sized chunks and if not using basa, remove any skin and bones.
| Season the fish with a good pinch of salt and half of the citrus zest and juice.
| Using a dry wok, brown the coconut flesh, turning it regularly.
| Add the vegetable oil, ginger and galangal, chillies, garlic, lemon grass and fry for a few minutes.Add the nam pla to the tin of coconut milk and add the coconut milk to the wok by straining through a fine sieve. Reserve the strained cream to add later.
| Add the turmeric powder and the chicken stock together with the remaining citrus juice and zest.
| Taste and season with salt and black pepper if needed.
| Bring to a gentle boil and simmer for 10 minutes.
| Add the fish and simmer for another 8 minutes.
| Remove from the heat and stir in the sieved coconut cream.
===Serving suggestions===
Serve with plain basmati rice and garnish with freshly chopped coriander
===Variations===
Use any firm fleshed white fish or even king prawns.  I think that this recipe would work just as well using chicken instead of fish.

I will try this with next with chicken thighs and chicken drumsticks.
===Chef's notes===
I used 2 Indian green chillies and one similarly sized red chili, finely chopped, seeds not removed, and the heat was perfect.
We would normally serve this with rice, but we had just been gifted some freshly dug new potatoes which actually went really well with this. Great for soaking up all that lovely gravy!
