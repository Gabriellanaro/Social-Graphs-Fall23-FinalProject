===Description===

Only this morning we mentioned that we hadn't had lamb shanks for a while, then this afternoon as I was thumbing through some old cookbooks, this recipe jumped out at me from my 1986 \"The Manhattan Chili Co. Southwest American Cookbook.  I have amended it to use a slow cooker and for once, used commercial curry powder rather than a homemade blend.

===Update===
The ingredients shown below have been much reduced from the original recipe because, to my taste, it was almost bitter.  To rescue the meal, I discarded all of the original gravy and served it with potatoes, carrots, peas and a normal onion gravy.  It still had a little of the curry bite so was not a complete disaster. The lamb shanks were perfectly cooked and delicious.

If you do make this, taste the gravy and adjust the seasoning before the extended cooking period.

===Ingredients===

| 100 ml olive oil
| 2 lamb shanks
| sea salt & freshly ground black pepper
| 2 onions, peeled and sliced
| 1 bulb of garlic, peeled and crushed
| 2 teaspoons of curry powder
| 1 teaspoon cumin seeds, lightly toasted and finely ground
| 1 teaspoon of dried Mexican oregano
| 1 tablespoon muscovado sugar
| 1 tin peeled plum tomatoes
| 330 ml Guinness (1 bottle)
| 100 ml beef stock
| ''optional'' - 2 teaspoons mild chilli powder (''guajillo'')

===Method===


| In a large flameproof casserole or dutch oven, heat 100 ml of olive oil, when hot add a good pinch of black pepper and  brown the lamb shank really well on all sides, this should take around 15 minutes.
| Sprinkle the lamb shanks with a pinch of salt and pop them in the slow cooker.  Discard the used oil.
| Return the pan to a low heat, add the remaining oil and the garlic and the onions, cover and saut\u00e9 for 15 minutes stirring now and then.
| Add the chillies, chilli powder, oregano and cumin and stir-fry uncovered for 5 minutes.
| Chop the tomatoes with a sharp knife while they are still in the can.
| Add them to the onions together with the Guinness, beef stock, 1/2 a teaspoon of sea salt,muscovado sugar and stir well.
| Add everything to the slow cooker, set to medium and cook for 5 hours, covered.
| After 5 hours, remove the lamb shanks and keep warm
| Test the gravy for seasoning, if you need it hotter, spice it up with your favourite chili sauce.
| Pour the cooking liquor through a sieve and press out all of the juices, discard the solids.
| Add the strained gravy to the casserole over a high heat and to bring it to the boil.  For the next 15 minutes, reduce this by one third by stirring, boiling and skimming.
| Serve the lamb shanks with the hot gravy.
===Serving suggestions===
