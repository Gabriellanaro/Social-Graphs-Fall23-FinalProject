Neither do you eat bacon, I'm certain - nice recipe though!

Pork belly with caramelized sauce and boiled egg.

===Ingredients===
| 500g pork belly - as I live in Turkey I get Bulgarian \"bakon\"
| 2 tablespoons sugar - I like brown sugar for more flavour
| 1 tablespoon fish sauce 
| 1 tablespoon soy sauce
| black pepper - fresh coarsely ground
| water - coconut juice is sweeter
| 3 boiled eggs

===Mise en place===
* Boil the eggs, peel and set aside for later.
* Cut the pork belly into 2cm chunks.
===Method===


| First caramelise the sugar: put a couple of tablespoons of sugar in the bottom of a small pot and add a little water. Apply medium low heat and wait until it turns brown, thick and bubbly.
| Add the chunks of pork belly, a tablespoon each of fish sauce and soy sauce, and a tablespoon of black pepper. At this point also add some water or coconut water if available. Add just enough liquid to reach the top of the pork chunks.
| Simmer until almost fully cooked and add the boiled eggs. Make sure to stir them so they turn brown all over and soak up the sauce.
| When the pork is cooked and shrunk it's ready!
===Serving suggestions===
Best served with freshly cooked rice.
===Variations===
I'm sure there are many variations of this recipe. I find this to be the easiest that I can do here in Turkey surrounded by non pork eaters who couldn't point to Vietnam on a map.
