I now make this in large batches and freeze it in plastic coffee cups, one cup per person. So easy!

===Description===

===Note to self===
Don't forget there is now the industrial version - tried and tested, makes 6 litres of curry sauce, ready to freeze.
----
I have now made this curry sauce recipe around twenty times and I think it is now perfect. It is our 'go to' recipe for curries.  Give it a try!

The recipe below makes about 1500 grams of curry sauce which we split into three 500 gram portions and vacuum seal and freeze for later use. A 500g portion is ideal for two people once meat or fish is added.
===Ingredients===

| 1 tablespoon of ghee
| 2  tablespoons olive oil
| big pinch of ground black pepper
| 2 medium onions, peeled and sliced
| 5 cloves of garlic, peeled and thinly sliced
| 1 can of coconut milk
| 2 cans of chopped tomatoes
| 1 teaspoon of malt vinegar - '''no more!'''
| 1 can of drained mixed beans or kidney beans
| 2 heaped teaspoons of Hot Madras curry powder
| 1 heaped teaspoon of hot chilli powder
| 1 heaped teaspoon of turmeric powder
| 1 heaped teaspoon of paprika powder
| 1 teaspoon of whole fenugreek seeds
| 1 tablespoon of muscovado sugar
| 3 teaspoons of dried parsley
| 1 teaspoon of vegetable stock powder
| 2 pinches of garam masala
| ½ teaspoon of sea salt

===Method===


| Mix all of the dried ingredients together so they can be added in one go
| In a wok, fry the onions for 5 minutes over a medium heat
| Add the sliced garlic and stir fry for a minute or so
| Stir in all of the dried ingredients and mix well
| Immediately add the vinegar, tinned tomatoes, coconut milk and kidney beans
| Mix well and add to the slow cooker on a low setting
| Slow cook for 5 hours
| Blend to a fine sauce using a stick blender.
===Serving suggestions===
500g lamb neck fillet cut into cubes and slow cooked; low setting, for 5+ hours, makes the best lamb curry.

We served this with roasted butternut squash, baked for 90 minutes at 200\u00b0 C
===Variations===
This works as a vegetarian curry sauce but would work equally well with meat or fish.

I would be inclined to add any meat at the start of the slow-cooking process, but I would add fish or prawns just for the final hour, to prevent over cooking.

===Quantities for freezing===
We vacuum seal the curry sauce in packets of around 500g which are good for two people once meat or vegetables are added.  If you were making double quantities of this recipe you can make six 420g bags of curry sauce for the freezer.
