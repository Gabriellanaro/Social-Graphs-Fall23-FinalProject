I loved these when mum made them, though they never looked like this picture!

===Description===

Another recipe from Mum's scribbled cookery notes.  Her original notes used self-raising flour but she later changed it to plain flour as she thought it was 'nicer'.  I'll leave it to you to decide which is best.

===Ingredients===

| 450 g (1 lb) cooking apples
| 50 g (2 oz) walnuts
| 100 g (4 oz) stoned dates
| 100 g (4 oz) wholemeal flour (see notes)
| 100 g (4 oz) muscovado sugar or jaggery
| 1 tablespoon honey
| 25g (1 oz) butter, melted
| 1 free range egg
| Pinch of salt


===Mise en place===

* Preheat the oven to 200\u00b0 C (400\u00b0 F - gas 6), [fan oven 180\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]
===Method===



| Peel, core and dice the apples
| Chop the dates and crush the walnuts
| Add all the ingredients to a mixing bowl and mix until combined well
| Spread the mixture into a lightly greased 20 cm (8\") square shallow baking tray
| Bake for 30 minutes or until golden brown
===Serving suggestions===
Cut into squares and server warm with soured cream
