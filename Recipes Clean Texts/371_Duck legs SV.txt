===Description===

This is a straightforward and easy recipe for cooking duck legs sous vide in a water bath.

===Ingredients===

| 4 Barbary duck legs
| 4 teaspoons ground black pepper
| 4 teaspoons garlic powder
| 2 heaped teaspoons ground mustard
===Mise en place===

* Preheat the water bath to 82\u00b0C (''179.6\u00b0F'')

===Method===



| Mix together the pepper, garlic powder and mustard.
| Rub all over the duck legs.
| Place the legs into separate pouches.
| Vacuum pack, seal and cook in the water bath for 8-10 hours.
| If they are not to be served immediately, plunge the pouches in iced water, leave to cool and refrigerate, then follow the instructions below re searing.
| If serving immediately, remove the duck from the pouches and sear each side in a very hot frying pan until both sides are crisp (about 1-2 minutes each side).
===Serving suggestions===
Serve with mashed potatoes and vegetables.
===Variations===
Any type of duck legs will be fine.  I just happened to have Barbary ones.
