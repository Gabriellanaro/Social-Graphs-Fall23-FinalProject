These crispy suet dumplings are easy to make and a great addition for stews and casseroles.

===Ingredients===
| 110 g (4 oz) self raising flour
| 50 g (2 oz) shredded Suet
| 2 tablespoons fresh parsley, chopped
| 1 tablespoon finely chopped onion
| Cold water to mix 
| ¼ teaspoon dried mixed herbs
| Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
| A good pinch of bicarbonate of soda (not essential, but good if you have it)
===Method===


| Add the ingredients to a bowl, gently rub the flour into the suet with your fingers.  When you can no longer feel the suet with your fingers, gradually add a few tablespoons of cold water and mix to form a soft but not sticky dough.
| Adjust the consistency of the dough by adding extra flour or water if required.
| Divide into 6 to 8 and form into balls
| Drop then into a stew or casserole about 20 to 30 minutes before the end of cooking
| Alternatively, boil in water or stock for 20 to 30 minutes
===Method: Crispy suet dumplings===
# Preheat the oven to 200\u00b0 C (400 \u00b0F - gas 6)
# Follow steps above
# Gently float on top of a stew or casserole
# Baste with a little of the gravy
# Bake (uncovered) at the top of the oven for 30 minutes or so - the dumplings should be cooked and crispy on the top
===Serving suggestions===
Dumpling are really nice, crisped under a grill once they have cooked. Especially cheese dumplings
===Variations===
Add 2 tablespoons of grated Cheddar cheese to make cheese dumplings
===Extend the shelf life of shredded suet===
Suet, once opened, has a very limited shelf life and will go rancid.  Once opened, if you do not need to use the whole packet, freeze the remainder; once properly defrosted it is a good a fresh suet, and it lasts for years in the freezer.
