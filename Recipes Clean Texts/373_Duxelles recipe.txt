You can't make Beef Wellington with this; and it's pretty good on its own too.

===Description===

'''Duxelles''' is a finely chopped mixture of mushrooms , onions or shallots and herbs, saut\u00e9ed in butter, and reduced to a paste (sometimes cream is used as well). It is a basic preparation used in stuffings and sauces (notably, beef Wellington), or as a garnish. Duxelles can also be filled into a pocket of raw pastry and baked as a savoury tart (similar to a hand-held pie).

'''Duxelles''' is made with any cultivated or wild mushroom, depending on the recipe. Duxelles made with wild porcini mushrooms will be much stronger flavoured than that made with white mushrooms or brown mushrooms. Fresh mushrooms are usually used, however reconstituted dried varieties are used as well. If you want a stronger flavour, use a mixture of both.

'''Duxelles''' is a useful way to freeze and store mushrooms that would not normally be reusable after freezing.

Duxelles is said to have been created by the 17th-century French chef Fran\u00e7ois Pierre La Varenne (1615\u20131678) and to have been named after his employer, Nicolas Chalon du Bl\u00e9, marquis d'Uxelles, mar\u00e9chal de France.

===Ingredients===
| 250 g mushrooms chopped very finely. A mixture of chestnut mushrooms, shiitake mushrooms and wild mushrooms works well.
| 2 shallots peeled and chopped very finely
| 2 cloves of Garlic, peeled and crushed
| 4 tablespoons butter
| 50 ml dry white wine
| Splash of lemon juice
| 1 sprig of thyme
| sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
===Method===

Don't rush this, it's quite long-winded and will probably take around 30 minutes cooking.

| Gently saut\u00e9 garlic and shallots in the  the finely chopped mushrooms in the butter for about 6 minutes until soft.
| Add the chopped mushrooms and the whole sprig of thyme and gently cook for 10 minutes so most of the mushroom liquor is cooked off.
| remove the sprig of thyme
| Add the wine, a splash of lemon juice and season to taste.
| Cook gently until all of the liquid has gone.
| The duxelles should stick together easily.
| Remove from the heat and allow to cool.
| Use in your recipe, spread on bread or crackers or freeze for later use.

===Chef's notes===
I never have white wine so use a little less dry sherry, watered down instead - no one has noticed yet!
