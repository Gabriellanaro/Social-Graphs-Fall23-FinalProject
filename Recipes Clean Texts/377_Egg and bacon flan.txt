Homemade quiches are the dog's!  So easy to add all of your favourite ingredients; normally lots of chillies. :D

[[Image:Remember the greaseproof.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Twice now, I've forgotten to put greaseproof paper under the baking beans.  Perhaps this picture will remind me next time!]]
Another recipe that has come about as a result of my recent craze, making quiches.  This time I thought I would use some of our Home smoked bacon and fresh eggs from our hens.

I'm using Jus Rol ready made shortcrust pastry and find that 1 500g pack is too much pastry for a (shallow) 10\" Push-out flan dish, so this time I used about half - which means I can make another one tomorrow!

===Ingredients===
| 250 g (9 oz) from block of ready-made shortcrust pastry
| 2 free range eggs, beaten
| 45 ml (4 tablespoons) of milk
| 3 tablespoons of mascarpone cheese
| 5 rashers of cooked bacon, home smoked bacon or ham, chopped into tiny pieces.
| freshly ground black pepper
| Slices of tomato or red pepper or green pepper or a mixture of all to garnish


===Mise en place===
* Allow the pastry to get to room temperature before rolling it out.

===Method===


| Preheated the oven to 200\u00b0 C (400\u00b0 F - Gas 6)
| Roll the pastry and use it to line a greased 20 cm (8\") push-out flan dish
| Bake blind at 200\u00b0 C (400\u00b0 F - Gas 6) for 10 minutes
| Beat the eggs, milk, mascarpone cheese and season to taste with pepper -  salt won't be needed with the bacon
| Stir in the bacon pieces
| Pour the egg and bacon mixture into the blind-baked flan case
| Decorate with whatever you have to hand, I used half of a green pepper, sliced, but use whatever you have to hand, tomatoes look and taste are good.
| Reduce the heat of the oven to 180\u00b0 C (350\u00b0 F - Gas 4)
| Bake for a further 40 minutes
===Serving suggestions===

Serve hot or cold
===Notes===
Our bacon is smoked and dried for 4 months so can be eaten without cooking rather like ham. If you're using normal bacon I would cook it first.
