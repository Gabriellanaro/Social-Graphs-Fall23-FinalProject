This recipe for the classic English milk loaf is made in a Thermomix, then baked in the oven. 

To give this its traditional shape, you will need a Mermaid Milk Loaf Tin which in the UK can be obtained through Amazon and other specialist kitchenware shops.  For those of you in Australia, I found some on E-bay (Australia), but unfortunately they don\u0092t seem to be available in Canada or the USA.

===Ingredients===
| 7g dried yeast or 15g fresh
| 270g milk
| 450g strong bread flour
| 1 tablespoon dried full-fat milk powder

| 2 tablespoons oil
| ½ teaspoon salt

===Method===

| Put the yeast in the bowl with the milk '''3 minutes / 37\u00b0 / Speed 1'''
| Add the remaining ingredients in the order given '''15 seconds / Speed 4'''
| Then '''2½ minutes / Speed Knead'''
| Leave in the bowl until the dough is pushing up the MC then '''10 seconds / Speed 4'''
| Leave to rise again as before (optional)
| Tip the dough out onto a lightly floured surface
| Lightly, but thoroughly grease the milk loaf pan with an oil such as groundnut which is low in monounsaturates and shake over a light dusting of flour. 
| Shape the dough into a cylinder the same length of the tin. 
| Place the dough into the bottom of the tin, engage the tabs and clip the tin together. 
| Set the tin aside in a warm place to allow the bread to rise - watch the dough through the small vision hole at the top. 
| Heat the oven to 200\u00b0 C (400\u00b0 F - gas 6). 
| As soon as the dough can be seen rising towards the hole, bake for 30 minutes (fan-assisted oven) or 35 minutes (conventional oven). 
| Allow the tin to cool for 2-3 minutes before unclipping and turn out onto a cooling rack.
===Recipe source===
* Adapted for Thermomix from the recipe supplied with the tin.  You don\u0092t get one now, probably because it was appalling (the quantities were wrong and too small to allow the dough to rise to the top of the tin.)
