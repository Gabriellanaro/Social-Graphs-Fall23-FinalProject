This recipe is based on one that I made at bread school day course at the '''[http://www.miele.co.uk/events/simply-cooking/Default.aspx M\u00edele Experience Centre]'''.

We have a separate recipe for making this in a Thermomix.

See '''Variations''' below for instructions on how to partially make this in a food mixer and breadmaker

===Ingredients===
| 15g fresh yeast
| 300ml (approx) sparkling water, at room temperature (see Chef's notes below)
| 500g strong white bread flour
| Â¾ teaspoon salt
| 15g olive oil
===Method===


| Crumble and dissolve the yeast in half of the water.
| Sieve the flour and salt into a mixing bowl.
| Cut the butter into the flour and thoroughly rub it in.
| When the yeast has dissolved mix it in with the flour and add the rest of the water as needed to form a moist dough - it is better for the dough to be a little bit too wet than too dry.
| Leave to rest for 10 minutes.
| Lightly flour a work surface and your hands and knead the dough for about 10 minutes until smooth and elastic.  Don't worry about the dough sticking to your hands as it will become less moist as you work it.
| Shape into a ball, place in an oiled bowl and cover with clingfilm.
| Leave until the dough has almost doubled in size (about an hour).
| Gently knock back with your finger tips and repeat steps 7 and 8, but the proving should only take about 45 minutes.
| Gently knock back again, face downards into a rectangle, one side being the same length as the tin.
| Roll the dough towards you as tightly as you can.
| Flatten and stretch the ends and tuck them underneath so that they meet up in the middle.
| Place into a 900g / 2lb loaf tin, cover with clingfilm and prove until the dough reaches the top of the tin.
| Make some diagonal slashes across the top or one long one across the lenghth and bake at 220\u00b0 C (425\u00b0 F - gas 7), [fan oven 200\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour] for 30-35 minutes until golden.
| Cool completely on a wire rack.
===Variations===
The first 4 stages can be done in a food mixer.  

Stages 1-9 can be done in a breadmaker on the longest dough setting. Panasonic SD253 breadmaker, this is French dough, for the Panasonic SD-ZB2502 automatic breadmaker, use menu option 21, French dough.
===Chef's notes===
The amount of water you need can depend on the heat and humidity of your kitchen.  It can also depend on the flour you are using.  I used very strong Canadian bread flour, which like wholemeal, needs much more water than ordinary bread flour.
