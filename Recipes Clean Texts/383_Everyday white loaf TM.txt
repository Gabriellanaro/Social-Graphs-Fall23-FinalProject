===Description===

This recipe is based on one that I made at bread school day course at the '''[http://www.miele.co.uk/events/simply-cooking/Default.aspx M\u00edele Experience Centre]''' and has been adapted for making in a Thermomix.  There is also a recipe for making this using the conventional method.

===Ingredients===TM
| 15g fresh yeast
| 300g (approx) sparkling water, at room temperature (see Chef's notes below)
| 500g strong white bread flour
| Â¾ teaspoon salt
| 15g olive oil
===Method===


| Add the yeast and water to the TM bowl.
| Mix for '''2 minutes / Temp. 37\u00b0 / Speed 1'''.
| Add the remaining ingredients in the order given above.
| '''3 minutes / Knead'''
| Leave in the TM bowl until the dough has rested and is touching the lid.
| '''12 seconds / Knead'''
| Tip the TM bowl upside down on a lightly floured surface .  
| Loosen the blades by undoing the blade unit at the base.  The weight of the blades will help the dough to drop out of the bowl onto the surface.  
| Pull any remaining bits of dough off the blades and out of the bowl.
| Shape into a ball, place in an oiled bowl and cover with clingfilm.
| Leave until the dough has almost doubled in size (about an hour).
| Gently knock back, face downards into a rectangle, one side being the same length as the tin.
| Roll the dough towards you as tightly as you can.
| Flatten and stretch the ends and tuck them underneath so that they meet up in the middle.
| Place into a 900g / 2lb loaf tin, cover with clingfilm and prove until the dough reaches the top of the tin.
| Make some diagonal slashes across the top or one long one across the lenghth and bake at 220\u00b0 C (425\u00b0 F - gas 7), [fan oven 200\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour] for 30-35 minutes until golden.
| Cool completely on a wire rack.
===Chef's notes===
The amount of water you need can depend on the heat and humidity of your kitchen.  It can also depend on the flour you are using.  I used very strong Canadian bread flour, which like wholemeal, needs much more water than ordinary bread flour.
