===Description===

This warming soup is made out of 4 of my favourite ingredients, namely cauliflower, cheese, garlic and chillies.  This recipe is designed to be made in a Thermomix.

===Ingredients===TM
| 380g cauliflower, broken into florets
| 1 bulb garlic, peeled
| 5 small chillies, de-stalked, with seeds left in
| 40g olive oil
| 150g strong, hard cheese, cut into chunks
| 300g-400g milk
| Up to 2 teaspoons vegetable bouillon powder
| Seasoning, if necessary
===Method===


| Add 500g cold water into the TM jug and place the steaming basket containing the cauliflower, inside.
| Steam for '''30 minutes / 100\u00b0 / Speed 1'''.
| Remove from TM and reserve.
| Add the garlic, chillies and oil to the jug  and saut\u00e9 '''10 minutes / Temp. Varoma / Speed 1'''.
| Add the reserved cauliflower and the cheese and mix '''10 seconds / Speed 5''' to chop the cheese.
| Add the milk and bouillon powder and cook for '''6 minutes / 90\u00b0 / Speed 4'''.
| Check seasoning and serve immediately.
===Variations===
Substitute the cauliflower with broccoli.
===Chef's notes===
Adjust the quantities of chillies and garlic to your own taste.  I like strong flavours so some people may find the above quantities excessive.  It also depends on the type of chilli as to its heat.  I used 'Superchilli' which is slightly on the spiteful side.

This recipe is ideal for using up any odd bits of cheese in your fridge and I added a mixture of Meldon (Devon) and Lake District Mature (Cumbria).  Parmesan, Beaufort or a vintage Cheddar would be ideal.
