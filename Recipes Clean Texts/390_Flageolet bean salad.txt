===Description===

Another recipe from my Mum's sheaf of cookery notes.  This went very nicely with some sliced ham.

===Ingredients===

| 225 g (8 oz) dried flageolet beans
| 1 whole lemon

| 4 tablespoons Olive oil
| 2 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed
| 3 tablespoons of freshly chopped parsley
| sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
===Mise en place===

* Soak the beans overnight in cold unsalted water
===Method===



| Add the beans to plenty of cold water
| Bring to the boil, reduce and simmer viperously for 1 hour or until tender but not mushy
| Drain and allow to cool a little
| Mix the remaining ingredients together and pour over the drained beans
| Cover and marinade for 2 hours or more
| Season to taste and serve
===Recipe source===

* My Mum!
===Variations===
It would have been nice garnished with a few slices of raw onion.

Use 2 x 400g cans of well rinsed and drained flageolet beans instead of dried beans.  Any beans or chick peas would work well in this recipe.
