This is a recipe based on French onion soup, but uses four types of the 'Allium' family and has cider as the alcoholic liquid rather than wine and/or brandy.  Also I have used a good cheese to sprinkle on top.

===Ingredients===
| 4 bulbs garlic, whole
| Olive oil
| 2 large onions, coarsely sliced
| 1 tablespoon olive oil
| 40g butter
| 1 teaspoon salt
| ½ teaspoon of sugar
| Bunch of spring onions, finely chopped
| 1 extremely fat leek or 2 medium ones, sliced thickly and washed thoroughly
| 40g flour
| 1.85 litres boiling vegetable stock
| 150 ml dry cider
| 225g Single Gloucester cheese, grated


===Mise en place===
* Preheat the oven to 180 C/350 F/Gas 4.
===Method===


| Keeping the bulbs intact, slice off the tops so that the flesh of each clove is exposed, and place in foil and put into a baking dish.
| Sprinkle with olive oil and loosely enclose in the foil.
| Bake for about an hour on a low shelf of the oven.
| In the meantime, place the onions in a large pan on a lowish heat, with the tablespoon olive oil and the butter.
| Cover and allow to stew for 15 minutes.
| Add the salt and sugar, and allow to caramelise slightly.
| Add the spring onions and the leeks and cook very gently, uncovered for about 30 minutes.
| Meanwhile, squeeze the garlic cloves from their skins into a bowl.
| Stir in the flour and cook for 3 minutes.
| Add the garlic, stock and the cider and simmer for a further 40 minutes.
| Serve in bowls with the cheese sprinkled on the top.
