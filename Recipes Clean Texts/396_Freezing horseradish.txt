===Description===

Initially I was uncertain if this idea would work - it works perfectly and I'm now a convert.  This is the way to store horseradish!

I have had superb success in freezing ginger and garlic for later use in small amounts so as I thought I would experiment with horseradish to see if it be treated in the same way.

I've chosen not to grate it before freezing at a I don't want to lose any of the essential oils.  After leaving it frozen for a week, to finish this experiment I made a horseradish dip by grating an inch of the root with a few tablespoons of Greek yogurt and a teaspoon of lime juice. It was superb, not too harsh and just lovely for dipping Twice fried, air fried potato chips.

===Ingredients===

| Dig up 2 medium horseradish plants
| The yield from 1 medium-sized horseradish plant is about 250g once trimmed and cleaned
| 500 g horseradish root

===Method===


| Soak the roots in a bucket for a few hours so you can remove the loose earth easily.
| Trim the leaves from the roots and discard them.
| In a ventilated place, use a sharp knife to trim root hairs and small roots from the main roots.
| Scrub the roots clean and use a sharp knife to  scrape the roots, rather as you would clean an old carrot.
| Cut the roots into thumb sized pieces.
| Dry the pieces of horseradish roots in a salad spinner.
| Vacuum seal the roots in dated bags and freeze for later use.
===Serving suggestions===
Defrost at a later date to make horseradish sauce or horseradish dip.
