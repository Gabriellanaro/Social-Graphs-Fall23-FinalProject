===Description===


Peas, ham and garlic are three flavours that really go well together.  This simple recipe combines all three as a great side dish, add a little pasta and you have a superb supper.

It is ideally made using fresh peas but is equally good with frozen baby peas.  I would not use minted peas for this, though that's a personal preference.

===Ingredients===
| A dash of olive oil
| 2 Cloves of garlic, peeled and finely sliced
| 175 g (6 oz) fresh or frozen peas
| 4 slices or parma ham, Home smoked bacon or good quality dry-cured bacon
| A grind of black pepper


===Mise en place===
* If using frozen peas or large fresh peas, cook as you would do normally, either microwave or boil for a few minutes. Drain well.
* Omit this stage if you are using fresh baby peas.
===Method===


| Slice the bacon into bite-sized strips
| Heat the oil in a small pan and add the garlic slices
| As soon as it starts to colour, add the ham or bacon
| Stir fry for a few minutes, until the meat takes a little colour
| Add the peas and continue to heat whilst jiggling the pan
| Serve immediately
===Variations===
This would work well with baby broad beans too
