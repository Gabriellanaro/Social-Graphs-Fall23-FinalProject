If the crumble mixture is over-blended are more like dough, spread it out over the baking tray as above, but periodically remove from the oven and bash into crumbs until you get the right texture

The fruit can be fresh, frozen and defrosted or confit / jarred and strained), stalks, cores, stones etc removed and peeled if necessary.
