===Description===

Use any combination of game for this slow cooker recipe.  I made it with bits of venison, pheasant, pigeon, duck and partridge.  If you buy any game and have just a little too much for the recipe you are making, just put the excess in a bag in the freezer and soon you will have enough to make a mixed game meal

'''For the casserole'''
===Ingredients===
| 2 tablespoons oil or goose fat
| 750g mixed game, cut into chunks
| 1 large red onion, chopped
| Garlic to taste, chopped (use lots of it!)
| 2 tablespoons plain flour
| 300ml robust red wine
| 300ml game or beef stock
| 1 tablespoon tomato pur\u00e9e
| 2 bay leaves
| 150g carrots, sliced lengthways
| 250g leeks, thinly sliced
| Seasoning
'''For the dumplings'''
===Ingredients===NB
| 150g self-raising flour
| 75g suet
| 3 tablespoons mixed fresh herbs, or 1 tablespoon dried herbs
| 75ml-100ml water
| Seasoning


===Mise en place===
* Preheat your slow cooker, if necessary, according to the manufacturer's instructions.
===Method===


| Heat the oil or fat in a pan to a high temperature.
| Add the game pieces and fry on all sides until they start to brown, then place them in the slow cooker.
| Add the onions to the pan and fry for a few minutes until soft, stir in the garlic and cook for a further minute of two.
| Transfer to the slow cooker.
| Stew the flour in the frying pan for 1 minute and slowly stir in the wine, stock and tomato puree ensuring that you are not left with any lumps.
| Add to the slow cooker and cook on low for about 7 hours.
| Stir the casserole, add the carrots and cook on high for 45 minutes.
| Meanwhile, mix together the dumpling ingredients, adding enough water to make a soft, but not sticky dough.
| Shape into 8 balls.
| Stir in the leeks and add the dumplings to the slow cooker.  At this stage, you may feel you need to add more stock, wine or water.
| Cook for a further 30-45 minutes until the dumplings are light and fluffy.
===Serving suggestions===
Serve with a hunk of bread.
===Variations===
Try this with beef, or with pork and cider.  Add mushrooms or other vegetables of your choice.
