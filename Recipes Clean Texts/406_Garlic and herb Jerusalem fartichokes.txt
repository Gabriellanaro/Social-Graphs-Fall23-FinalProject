===Description===


Gerard's Herbal (1621) had a view on Jerusalem artichokes: \"which way soever they be dressed and eaten, they stir and cause a filthy loathsome stinking wind within the body, thereby causing the belly to be pained and tormented, and are a meat more fit for swine than men.\"

Anyway, lets not let that get in our way.  Anitra has, by daughter-proxy, given us a huge pile of Jerusalem artichokes that I am determined to use.  This shall be the first attempt.
===Update===
Gerard had something here.  Pretty non-descript, this, even with all the garlic and bay leaves.  Sweet tasting, rather similar to parsnip or sweet potato, neither of which are my favourites.  These are also quite a fiddle to prepare and there is a fair deal of waste too.  I would feed these to worms. 

===Ingredients===
| 600 g (1lb 2 oz) Jerusalem artichokes (peeled weight)
| A few glugs of olive oil, flavoured with a few good grinds of black pepper.
| 4 Cloves of garlic, peeled and sliced thinly
| 6 bay leaves - you can use less, but if you have a bay tree to hand, why not?  Let's go for big flavour here.
| 2 tablespoons sherry vinegar
| sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
===Method===


| Peel the artichokes and cut into even side pieces, about the size of halved ping-pong balls
| Heat a wok or frying pan with a few glugs of olive oil and saute over a fairly high heat until they have golden edges
| Lower the heat a little, add the garlic and fry it off a little
| Deglaze the pan with the sherry vinegar, add the bay leaves, seasoning, cover and cook for 25 to 30 minutes
| Remove the cover and the bay leaves, turn up the heat and crisp up the artichokes for 3 or 4 minutes
| Season and serve immediately
