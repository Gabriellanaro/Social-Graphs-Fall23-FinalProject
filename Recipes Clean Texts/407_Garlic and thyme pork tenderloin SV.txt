===Description===

A simple recipe using one of the best pork cuts, cooked sous vide.

===Ingredients===

| 1 piece of pork tenderloin (fillet) weighing about 650g
| 1 tablespoon garlic powder
| 1.5 tsps. dried or 1-2 tablespoons fresh thyme
| Freshly ground pepper
| Salt (see Chef's notes below)
| Oil
===Mise en place===

* Preheat the water bath to 56.5\u00b0C (''149\u00b0F'') for medium rare or 60\u00b0C (''140\u00b0F'') for medium

===Method===


| Pat dry the pork.
| Smear with the garlic powder. thyme and pepper.  Sprinkle with salt if desired at this stage (see Chef's notes below).
| Place in a suitable vacuum packing bag and seal.
| Put into the bath and cook for a minimum of 2 hours and a maximum of 8 hours.
| Remove from the bag and drain.
| In the meantime, preheat oil in a frying pan as hot as you can.
| Season with salt if you have not previously done so.
| Sear the meat for a minute each side until browned.
| Pat dry, rest for a few minutes, the cut into slices.
===Serving suggestions===
As part of a main course, serve with roast potatoes or mash, vegetables and onion gravy.  Alternatively serve hot or cold as a snack or tapa with salad and/or a salsa
===Variations===
Use oregano or marjoram instead of the thyme
===Chef's notes===
Season with salt by all means, BUT if a) you are not starting the cooking process straight away or b)  cooking for a long period or c) using the cook-chill method, it would be better to salt just before searing.  Contact between meat and salt for a longer length of time may cause the meat to be dry.
