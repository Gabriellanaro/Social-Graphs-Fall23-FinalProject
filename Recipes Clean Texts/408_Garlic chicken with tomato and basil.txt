[[Image:Garlic chicken marinade.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Ready to marinate]]
A simple and very tasty chicken dish.

===Ingredients===
| 2 skinless & boneless chicken breasts
| Juice of one lemon (see method)
| A good 3 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil
| 5 cloves garlic crushed
| Salt & pepper
===Method===

'''Prepare chicken'''

| Slash chicken breasts across about 5 times. Make the cuts fairly deep because you want the marinade to really penetrate.
| Place in a shallow bowl
'''Marinade'''

| First microwave the whole lemon for about 15 seconds. This will enable you to extract the maximum amount of juice
| Cut the lemon in half and squeeze the juice out into a small mixing bowl removing any pips
| Add the oil and the Crushed garlic and season generously
| Mix well and pour over the chicken breasts
| Cover with clingfilm and place in the fridge
| After half an hour turn the chicken over in the marinade, re-cover and put back in the fridge.
| Turn chicken over after half an hour (the chicken needs at least 1 hour of marinating)
| Heat a smallish frying pan over a medium heat and when hot put the chicken in the pan cut-side-up together with half of the marinade
| Cook for 10 minutes basting regularly with the marinade
| Check the underside of the chicken after about 10 minutes. If nicely brown, turn it over and put in the rest of the marinade.
| Give this side 10 minutes, again basting regularly.
| The lemon juice will evaporate leaving a nice brown sticky residue on the meat. The oil will separate.
| Give the meat a little cut in the middle and check that it's not pink. 
| Stir in 3 tablespoons of oven dried tomatoes and a big handful of chopped basil leaves.
===Serving suggestions===
Serve immediately with croquette potatoes and peas with the juices and oil from the pan poured over
