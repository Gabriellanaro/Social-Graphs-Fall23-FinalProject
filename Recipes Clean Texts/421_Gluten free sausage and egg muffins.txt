===Description===

[[Image:Harrogate-pork-sausages.png|300px|thumb|right|Debbie and Andrew's Harrogate 97% Gluten Free Pork Sausages]]
These sausage and egg muffins are far tastier than their well known namesake because they contain award winning debbie and andrew's sausages, they are also gluten free.
===Ingredients===

| 1 pack Debbie and Andrew's Harrogate 97% Gluten Free Pork Sausages
| 6 free range eggs
| 3 English muffins (if you can't find gluten free, try Gluten Free Rolls like these from Udi's)
| 15g Butter to spread
| A little olive oil
| Salt and pepper
===Mise en place===

* Preheat your oven to 190\u00b0 C (375\u00b0 F - gas 5), [fan oven 170\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]

===Method===


| Drizzle a little oil into a baking tray and place the sausages in the tray. Roast in the preheated oven for 25 minutes, shaking the tin once or twice in that time.
| Remove the tray from the oven and drain the sausages on kitchen paper. When they have cooled a little, cut each in half lengthways and drain on kitchen paper again.
| In a large frying pan, fry the 6 eggs (to taste) in a little hot oil. Season with salt and pepper and put to one side.
| Meanwhile, half and toast your muffins (in your toaster if they fit, under the grill if not). Spread all 6 halves generously with butter.
| Place the muffin halves on plates - 2 to each plate. Top each half with two sausage halves, then top each with an egg.
===Serving suggestions===
Season with more salt and pepper and serve.
