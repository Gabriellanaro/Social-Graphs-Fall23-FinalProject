Pretty tasty. I think a lot of sausages nowadays are gluten free also.

This warming gluten free sausage cassoulet is easy to make and can be completed in less than one hour.  It is brought to Cookipedia courtesy of debbiesandandrews sausages.
===Ingredients===

| 1 Pack of Debbie and Andrew's Harrogate 97% Gluten Free Pork Sausages
| 2tbs olive oil
| 200g smoked lardons
| 1 brown onion, diced
| 2 carrots, diced
| 2 celery sticks, diced
| 1 sweet potato, cubed
| 2 cloves garlic, minced
| 10 sage leaves - roughly chopped
| ½ bottle of red wine
| 400g can cannellini beans - drained and rinsed
| 400g can of chopped tomatoes
| 2tbs honey
| 50g gluten free breadcrumbs

===Method===


| Use a large, stove-top and oven friendly dish. On a medium/high heat, fry off the lardons, onion, carrot, sweet potato, celery and sage in the olive oil until golden brown - about 10 minutes. Add the garlic and red wine and cook out for 5 minutes until reduced by half.
| Add your tomatoes, cannellini beans, honey and season with salt and pepper to taste.
| Place the debbie&andrew's Harrogate 97% Pork Sausages carefully on top being careful not to fully submerge as you want the sausages to get a lovely golden brown colour.
| Sprinkle with breadcrumbs, drizzle with a little extra olive oil and lay a few extra whole sage leaves on the top.
| Place in the oven and bake for 40 minutes.
===Serving suggestions===
Serve hot with crusty gluten free bread.
