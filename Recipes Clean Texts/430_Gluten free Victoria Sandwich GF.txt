[[Image:Gluten_free_angel_cake_(GF)_ready_to_fill.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Gluten free Victoria Sandwich cake, ready to fill]]
This is an all-time family favourite and well worth the bit of effort.

===Ingredients===
| 170 g/6oz Wellfoods Gluten Free Flour Alternative
| 2 teaspoons of baking powder, (Check its Gluten Free), sifted into the flour.
| 170 g/6oz Vanilla Sugar, (or 1 teaspoon of vanilla essence added to caster sugar)
| 170 g/6oz Soft Margarine
| 3 Large free range eggs, lightly beaten
'''filling'''
* 180 g Filling of your choice, for example, Strawberry jam. (Beaten slightly to soften)
* 1 Teaspoon of caster sugar for dusting.

===Mise en place===
* Preheat the oven to 190\u00b0 C (375\u00b0 F - gas 5), [fan oven 170\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]
* Grease and baseline 2 x 7\" (18cm) sandwich tins.
===Method===


| Cream the margarine and sugar together until soft, fluffy and pale in colour.
| Add the one third of the egg, and a spoon of flour, beat in with each addition.
| Add final spoon of flour and carefully fold into the mixture.
| Divide mixture between the tins, check the weight on scale.
| Level the tops with a knife, making a slight hollow in the centre of each.
| Bake in the centre of the oven for about 20 minutes until golden and slightly shrinking away from the edges of the tins and when lightly pressed with a finger, should spring back into shape.
| Remove from the oven, cool slightly, and then turn out onto a wire cooling rack. 
| The sponge is delicate\u0085so handle with care. 
| When completely cold, peel off the greaseproof paper and sandwich together with the filling of your choice. Dust with caster sugar.
| Variations:
| Finish the cake when cool by filling with butter cream and decorate with walnut pieces.
| This basic recipe could be divided into 15 or so bun cases, or iced to form a birthday cake.

===Variations===
Substitute one tablespoon of cocoa (check as usual for suitability) for one of flour; add a tablespoon of hot water to enrich the cocoa. Fold into mixture carefully or make a marble effect. 

Fill with vanilla butter cream and finish with a melted chocolate topping.

Or
 
Add two tablespoons coffee granules in 1 tablespoon almost boiling water. Stir well.

When cool, add it to the cake mix with the last of the flour.
===Chef's notes===
Unfilled, the cake freezes well. Wrap the two cakes separately in cling film. 
Freezer storage for 3 months. Defrost at room temperature for an hour.
