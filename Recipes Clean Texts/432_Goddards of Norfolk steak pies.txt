This is just a personal aide-memoire so I know the correct temperature and time to cook these wonderful local pies.

150\u00b0 for 15 minutes is all that's needed to re-heat their pies as they are already cooked
===Ingredients===
| 1 Goddard's Steak pie, or
| 1 Goddard's Steak and kidney pie, or
| 1 Goddard's Steak and ale pie, or
| 1 Goddard's steak and stilton pie

===Method===


| Cut your chosen pie into four quarters
| Place the portions in the basket of the Pro Breeze air fryer
| Cook at 150\u00b0 for 15 minutes
| Serve immediately
