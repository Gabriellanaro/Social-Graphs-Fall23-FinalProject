The Judge 

A tasty, but rather unhealthy change from turkey for Christmas lunch.  This is a treat for my husband who for the best part of the year restricts his consumption of saturated fat.  The recipe is vaguely based on a healthier '''[http://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/9098/sticky-slowroast-belly-of-pork James Martin recipe]'''.

===Ingredients===
| 1.4 kg belly pork, boned and scored
| 2 teaspoons goose fat
| 2 teaspoons green peppercorns, crushed
| Coarse sea salt
| 1 teaspoon dried thyme
| 3 large onions, sliced
| Garlic to taste, separated, but not peeled
| 2 tablespoons of extra goose fat


===Mise en place===
* Preheat the oven to 180C/fan 160C/gas 4.
===Method===


| Place the pork, skin-side up, on a rack in a roasting tin. 
| Smear with 2 teaspoons goose fat, then lightly press on the crushed peppercorns, a sprinkling of coarse sea salt and thyme. 
| Put in the oven, then cook for 1 hour. 
| Remove from the oven and baste with the juices. Continue to cook for a further 1Â½ hours, basting every 30 minutes.
| Put the sliced onions and garlic in the roasting tin underneath the pork. 
| Brush 2-3 tablespoons of goose fat over the pork, then increase the oven to 200C/fan 180C/ gas 6. 
| Cook for a further 30-40 mins, basting occasionally. Once cooked and tender (this can be easily tested by piercing the flesh with a knife), remove pork from the oven, then leave to rest for 10-15 mins.
| While the pork is resting, heat the tin on the stove with the onions, adding 2 tablespoons of water. This will lift any residue from the pan, creating a moist cooking liquor. Season the onions with salt and pepper, then divide between 6 plates. 
| Carve pork into 6 portions, then serve on top of the onions and pour over the cooking liquor.  Squeeze the garlic over the top.
===Serving suggestions===
Serve with roast potatoes, vegetables and white wine gravy.
===Chef's notes===
If making in smaller quantities you will need to reduce the cooking times in proportion to the weight of the pork.
