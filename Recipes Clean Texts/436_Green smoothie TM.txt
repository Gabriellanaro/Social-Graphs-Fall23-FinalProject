===Description===

This healthy recipe is delicious although it may sound strange.

===Ingredients===TM
| 1 large apple, quartered, stem discarded
| 2 ripe bananas, peeled
| 35g fresh watercress (see variations below)
| 1 fresh lime - juice of the whole lime plus ¼ of the squeezed lime including skin and pith
| 150g kefir or natural live organic yogurt (kefir has more probiotics)
| 30g hemp seeds or linseeds or chia seeds or 1 raw organic free-range egg or 30 to 50 g nuts of choice
| 25g agave syrup or Sweet Freedom or 15 g honey or 15 g palm sugar (optional)
| ½ sheet dried nori or 1 tablespoon dried seaweed pieces - an excellent source of minerals (optional)
| 150g ice cubes
| ⅛ teaspoon sea salt or pink Himalayan salt - an excellent source of minerals 
| 500g water, divided 300 g and 200 g
===Method===


| Add or weigh in all ingredients except the last 200 g water. 
| Blend 2½ minutes/Speed 10.
| Add remaining 200 g water and mix 10 seconds/Speed 4. Add more water if you prefer.
===Recipe source===
* ''My Thermomix'' newsletter for January 2012
===Variations===
Substitute any of the following for the watercress:  
*rocket
*flat-leaf parsley  
*spinach  
*swiss chard
*lettuce  
*kale  
*green outer cabbage leaves
*wild greens, e.g. dandelion leaves or fresh nettle tops 
*a mixture of any of the above 
I find that it is particularly good with a stick of celery and a couple of cabbage leaves.
===Chef's notes===
Drink immediately for best nutritional benefits, or keep in the fridge for up to 24 hours in a clean glass bottle/jar with a lid or stopper.  If using Sweet Freedom, I find that 15g is enough.
