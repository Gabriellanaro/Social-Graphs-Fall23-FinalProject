A lovely way to cook whole corn on the cob (sweetcorn).

Toasting the sweet corn adds a lovely flavour  which I've done by using a blowtorch.  This can be achieved using a very hot frying pan too.

===Ingredients===

| 1 fresh corn on the cob
| A knob of butter
| A pinch of sea salt
===Mise en place===

* If using a frying pan or griddle pan, pre heat this while the sweet corn is being prepared.

===Method===


| If the sweetcorn cob has a leaves and silk ( is the name for the pistillate flowers), remove them first.
| Soak for 4 minutes in cold water.
| Microwave for 2 minutes
| If using a hot pan to finish them, pat them dry, once the pan is very hot, add them to the pan, without any oil and toast them for 4 minutes turning regularly with tongs.
| If using a blowtorch, place the corn cob in a dry frying pan and toast the kernels while turning the cob with tongs.  This only takes 20 seconds and is very easy to overdo it with a good blowtorch.
===Serving suggestions===
Serve with butter and a pinch of salt.
===Chef's notes===
To strip the kernels from the cob, hold with a tea-towel if it's very hot and cut downwards with a knife.
