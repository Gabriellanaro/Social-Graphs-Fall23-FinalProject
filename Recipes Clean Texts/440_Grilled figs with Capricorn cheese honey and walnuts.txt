===Description===

This unusual dessert recipe is reproduced by the kind permission of The Lubborn Creamery.

===Ingredients===
| 40g (1 Â½oz) walnut halves
| 8 fresh figs
| 1 x 100g Capricorn Somerset Goats' cheese, diced
| 18 teaspoon Greek honey to drizzle
| crisp almond biscuits to serve


===Mise en place===
* Preheat the grill to a moderate setting
===Method===


| Spread the walnuts out on a baking tray and toast under the grill for 1-2 mins, watching closely so that they don't burn. Remove and break up into smaller pieces.
| Cut a cross in each fig, keeping them attached at the base, then squeeze so that each one opens up like a flower.
| Divide the Capricorn Somerset Goats' cheese between the figs and place on the baking tray. Place under the grill and cook for 2-3 mins or until the cheese is bubbling and golden.
| Transfer to serving plates, scatter with walnuts and drizzle each fig with a teaspoon of Greek honey.
| Serve immediately, accompanied by crisp almond biscuits
