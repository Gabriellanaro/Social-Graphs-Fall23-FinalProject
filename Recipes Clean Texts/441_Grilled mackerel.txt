As mackerel is quite an oily fish, it's nice to have clean citrus flavours to cut the oil.  This would be nice with a dollop of horseradish cream and a grapefruit salsa.

Your fishmonger will fillet mackerel if you ask.

===Ingredients===
| 2 fresh mackerel fillets
| Olive oil
| Zest and juice of a lime
| Freshly ground black pepper
===Method===


| With a sharp knife, slash the skin at regular intervals, not cutting all the way through
| Season each side with salt, pepper and lime zest and juice and then drizzle with a little olive oil
| Grill for 5 minutes per side then set aside to rest for 5 minutes
===Serving suggestions===

Serve hot or cold with a dollop of horseradish cream and grapefruit salsa

===Chef's notes===
Don't be tempted to add salt as processed mackerel can be quite salty already.
