===Description===

A quick and easy recipe that is idea for students or anyone who is short on time and cooking equipment.

===Ingredients===

| 2 cloves of garlic, peeled and crushed
| 1 onion, peeled and finely chopped
| 2 tablespoons olive oil
| 125 g pack of cooked sliced ham, chopped finely
| 1 tablespoon tomato puree
| ¼ teaspoon caster sugar, or cheat: crush normal sugar between 2 tablespoons
| ½ teaspoon dried oregano
| 1 400g can of chopped tomatoes
| 225 g (8 oz) spaghetti
| Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
| 1 ball of mozzarella cheese, grated or finely sliced and chopped

===Method===


| Boil a kettle full of water for your pasta
| Add the olive oil to a frying pan and give it a good twist of black pepper
| Gently fry the onions for 4 minutes, stirring now and then
| Add the garlic and fry for another few minutes, don't let it burn
| Add the ham and 'stir-fry' it for a minute so it can absorb the flavour of the garlic and onions
| Meanwhile, cook the spaghetti for 8 to 10 minutes in lightly salted boiling water
| Drain and return to the pasta saucepan
| Pour the sauce over the cooked pasta and mix really well
===Serving suggestions===
Serve with the grated mozzarella sprinkled on top.

A few fresh tomatoes dotted about look and taste nice and could be part of your 5 a day.
===Variations===
Use any herbs of your choice, as a general rule you can usually use double the amount of fresh herbs compared to  dried herbs.

Spoil yourself, add a little grated parmesan cheese as well
===Chef's notes===
Cheat on the chopped tomatoes, use normal canned tomatoes  and while they are still in the can, use a sharp knife to chop them up.
