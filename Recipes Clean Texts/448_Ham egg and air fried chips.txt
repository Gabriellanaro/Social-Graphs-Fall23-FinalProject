===Description===

Experimenting with our new Tefal air fryer, ham, egg and chips seemed to be an obvious choice. It was made much easier using our new (\u00a311.00) chip cutter.

37 minutes was perfect time for MacDonald's sized fries pictured.
===Ingredients===

| 450 g Maris Piper potatoes
| 4 medium eggs
| 200g sliced honey roast ham
| 5 medium tomatoes

===Method===


| Peel the potatoes and cut to McDonald's size fries
| Rinse off excess starch by soaking in cold water for 5 minutes
| Dry using a salad spinner
| Add the chips to your air fryer together with 3 teaspoons of oil
| Switch on and time for 30 minutes to remind you to cook the eggs
| Meanwhile grill the tomatoes under a low grill
| When the alarm goes, it's time to fry the eggs
| Silicone egg rings are the best way to get nice neat 'round' eggs - they are also easy to clean.
| '''Serve once the fries have cooked for 37 minutes'''
