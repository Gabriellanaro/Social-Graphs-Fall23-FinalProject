Lovely spicy flavour, complex, but not too hot.

===Description===

Another excuse to play with Taste Sensation's spice mixes.  This time Taste Sensation harissa seasoning.

I've used a similar recipe as the basis for this, but used only the harissa seasoning, rather than a selection of spices as I wanted to really taste their seasoning in this.

Our butcher has been very generous with the ribs too. More of a loin cut than ribs.  We've used about 900g of the ribs for two greedy people as a main.
===Ingredients===

| 900g pork spare ribs - separated
| 3 fat cloves of garlic - or lots of miserable little ones
| 250 ml red wine -  we freeze any leftover red wine, great for recipes like this.
| 2 tablespoons sherry vinegar
| 2 tablespoons tomato puree
| 1 tablespoon honey
| 2 scant tablespoons of Taste Sensation harissa seasoning
===Mise en place===

* Preheat your oven to 140\u00b0 C (350\u00b0 F - gas 4), [fan oven 160\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]

===Method===


| Separate the ribs (or meat) into manageable chunks, or get your butcher to do this.
| Add everything to a Lock & Lock box, close the lid and shake like crazy for a minute or so.
| Leave to marinade for 24 hours in a cool place
| When ready to cook, shake up again and then tip everything out onto a deep baking tray, cover with a tray or tin-foil and roast at the top of the oven for about 4 hours stirring up occasionally.
| About 15 minutes before you are ready to serve, turn the heat up to 220\u00b0, uncover and cook until all the juices have turned dark and sticky and coated the ribs.
| Serve
===Serving suggestions===
This went very nicely with peas, sweetcorn, carrots and a simple, non-spicy gravy. 
===Recipe source===

* Inspired by Taste Sensation Seasonings!

===Chefs notes===
Because Christmas dinner got in the way of devouring these, they actually spent 3 days marinating in the fridge. And were no better or worse for that, so don't be concerned about how long you marinade them for, providing it is in a cool place.
