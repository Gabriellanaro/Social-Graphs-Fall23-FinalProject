You cannot beat local fresh veg.

===Description===

We bought some lovely fruit and veg. from our local vegetable stall and I knocked this recipe up to use them.  It was fabulous, easy to make and  even easier to modify to suit your particular tastes.

The squash was the colourful winter squash (dumpling squash) and as this was a side dish for two people, half the squash was enough for both of us. The  tangerines were tiny, packed full of flavour with thin skins and very little pith.  The carrots had been picked that day, complete with leaves.

Choose whatever herbs you enjoy and just sprinkle them over the vegetables before roasting.
===Ingredients===

| Half a small colourful winter squash (dumpling squash)
| 3 carrots
| 3 tangerines
| 1 scant teaspoons of dill seeds
| 1 scant teaspoon of caraway seeds
| 10 Szechuan peppercorns, crushed in a pestle and mortar
| Pinch of sea salt
| 1 tsb olive oil
===Mise en place===

* Preheat your oven to 220\u00b0 C (425\u00b0 F - gas 7), [fan oven 200\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]

===Method===


| Scoop the seeds from the squash and peel it and cut into small slices.
| Peel or scrape the carrots, cut into halves or quarters lengthwise and then into pieces so they are the same size as the squash pieces.
| Remove the peel from the tangerines and separate the segments and leave un-peeled; we're going to use them whole.
| Tip everything into a roasting tray and spay or brush them with about a tablespoon of olive oil.
| Sprinkle the seeds and seasonings over the top, shake the tray well and roast for about 30 minutes or until the carrots are done to your liking - everything else should be done nicely if the carrots are cooked as you like them.

===Variations===
Use any herbs or spices that you like - chilli flakes and fennel would be nice with this too.
