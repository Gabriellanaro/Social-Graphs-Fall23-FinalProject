From the Ministry of Food leaflet \"All about Herrings\" - reprinted in 1948!

I had no idea what lemon substitute might have been, but editor Roses2at has done a little research and has come up with either apple peel or citric acid - see the comments page for more details.

===Ingredients===
| 8 oz grated raw potato
| 8 oz grated raw apple
| 3 oz chopped onion
| Â¼ level teaspoon nutmeg
| 2 level teaspoons salt
| Pinch of pepper
| 1 teaspoon lemon substitute
| 4 herrings, cleaned and boned
| 6 oz [shortcrust] pastry
===Method===


| Arrange half the potato, apple and onion in a pie dish
| Sprinkle on the nutmeg, seasoning and lemon substitute
| Lay the herrings on the top
| Cover with the remainder of the potato, apple and onion mixture
| Roll out the pastry
| Cover the dish with it, and bake in a hot oven (220\u00b0 C / 425\u00b0 F / Gas 7) for 30 minutes
