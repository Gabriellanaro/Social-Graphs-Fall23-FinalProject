===Description===


I love cauliflower cheese and this one is probably the best I have ever made.

===Ingredients===TM
| 50g white caster sugar
| 100g white wine vinegar
| 2 small cauliflowers, broken into florets and divided into three
| Groundnut oil
| 500g vegetable stock
| 300g water
| 1 bulb garlic, peeled
| 300g white wine, reduced to 30ml ('''10-15 minutes / Temp. Varoma / Speed 1''')
| 120g Gruy\u00e8re cheese, grated
| 20g cornflour
| 30g cream cheese
| Knob of butter
| 25g extra grated Gruy\u00e8re or Cheddar for the topping

===Mise en place===
* Add the sugar and vinegar to the bowl and set the TM to 100\u00b0.
* Once it has reached this temperature, pour the mixture over one third of the cauliflower.
* Allow to cool somewhat and leave in the fridge overnight.
===Method===


| The next day, grate the cheese for cooking and topping separately in the TM and coat the cooking cheese in the cornflour (I used Gruyere for cooking and a mixture of that and mature Cheddar for the topping) and set aside.
| Put one third of the cauliflower into the internal steaming basket with the vegetable stock and water '''16 minutes / Temp. Varoma / Speed 1.'''
| Meanwhile, deep fry the remaining third of the cauliflower at 180\u00ba C until golden brown.
| Drain the cauliflower on kitchen paper and deep fry the garlic until golden brown, but make sure it doesn't burn.
| Remove the steamed cauliflower (keep the liquid), mix with the others and place in a baking dish or casserole.
| Reduce the stock / water mix to 200ml '''18 minutes / Temp. Varoma / Speed 1''' and leave in the bowl.
| Preheat the grill to high. 
| Add the wine, cornfloured cheese, butter and the fried garlic to the TM bowl with the butter '''5 minutes/ 90\u00ba / Speed 4'''.
| Add the cream cheese and cook at the same setting for a further 1 minute.
| Process '''15 seconds / Speed 5-10 progressively''', so that the garlic is well pulverised. 
| Mix the sauce with the cauliflower, sprinkle over the grated chase and grill for several minutes.
