===Description===


This is my take on shepherds' pie which I am topping with Purple Majesty potatoes.  My wife wears a lot of purple and she is a bit hippy-ish, hence the name.   Do not be alarmed however, at the use of hemp seed oil.  Although it comes from the seeds of ''Cannabis sativa'', the oil does not contain the psychoactive contents of the plant.  Looks weird, but tastes delicious!

'''For the mutton'''
===Ingredients===
| Olive oil
| 500g shoulder of mutton, trimmed of fat and cut into smallish chunks
| Hemp seed oil
| 150g celery, hacked rustically
| 150g carrots, peeled and hacked rustically
| 1 medium green pepper, hacked rustically
| 1 medium yellow pepper, hacked rustically
| 1 medium onion, chopped
| 1 red onion, chopped
| 1 bulb garlic, crushed
| 400ml meat stock
| 1 tablespoon tomato pur\u00e9e
| 30ml worcestershire sauce
| Seasoning
| 3 heaped teaspoons cornflour
'''For the potato topping'''
===Ingredients===NB
| 1kg Purple Majesty potatoes
| 60ml hot milk
| 40g butter
| 30ml olive oil
| 1 egg yolk
===Method===


| Heat a little olive oil in a saucepan to smoking point.
| Add the mutton and cook until the juices have evaporated and the meat has begun to caramelise.
| Transfer the mutton into a deep oven-proof dish.
| Using the same pan, heat a little hemp seed oil and reduce the heat to medium.
| Add the celery and carrots and cook until they are beginning to colour and soften.
| Stir in the onion and peppers, adding more hemp seed oil if necessary, and cook for about until they, too, are soft, stirring from time to time
| Add the garlic and fry for 2-3 minutes - do not allow it to burn.
| Mix the vegetables with the mutton and season to taste.
| Still using the same saucepan, heat the stock, tomatoe pur\u00e9e and Worcestershire sauce.
| Put the cornflour in a mug or jug and add some hot stock to it, a little at a time, stirring until you have a thick, smooth paste.
| Add  a little more stock to it, stir, and pour into the saucepan with the rest of the stock.
| Tip the mutton and vegetable into the stock, reduce the heat and simmer, partially covered, for 10-15, stirring occasionally.
| The stock should be fairly thick.
| Pour back into the oven-proof dish and allow to cool completely.
| Meanwhile, boil the potatoes in unsalted water until the are cooked - about 20 minutes.
| Preheat the oven to 140\u00b0 C (257\u00b0 F - gas 1)
| Drain the potatoes in a colander, place the colander on a metal tray and put in the oven to dry out for about 15-20 minutes.
| Mash or rice the potatoes, gradually incorporating the hot milk, butter, oil and egg yolk.
| Allow to cool competely.
| Using a palette knife, spread the potato mixture over the mutton,
| Run a fork, which has been dipped in milk, over the top of the potato to make a pattern.
| Bake at 200\u00b0 C (400\u00b0 F - gas 6) for 10 minutes, reduce the heat to 180\u00b0 C (350\u00b0 F - gas 4) and bake for a further 30 minutes.
===Variations===
Of course, you can use whatever mashing potatoes, vegetables and oil you like.  
The garlic quantity may seem large, but it will not be overpowering.  I would have added more, but I couldn't be bothered to peel more than one bulb.

Use lamb or beef instead of mutton.

Substitute some of the stock with red wine.
