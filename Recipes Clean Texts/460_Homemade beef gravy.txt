===Description===

Tasty and easy to make homemade gravy.

===Ingredients===
| Beef trimmings, including offal such as kidney, liver, heart, etc.
| 1 onion, cut in half, one half chopped finely
| 8 black peppercorns
| Handful of parsley leaves and stems
| 1 teaspoon of beef dripping or butter
| 1 tablespoon of plain flour
| Gravy browning (optional)
| sea salt to taste
===Method===


| Place the meat trimmings, half of the onion, the peppercorns, parsley and a pint of water
| Bring to the boil, reduce the heat and simmer, covered, for 1 hour
| Remove from the heat and strain the stock into a separate bowl
| In the same pan, melt the dripping and fry the chopped half of the onion until it is nicely browned 
| Stir in the flour and mix well
| Little by little add the stock, stirring as you go
| Add a little gravy browning if needed
| Season to taste and serve immediately
===Variations===
Use other seasonal herbs as available.  Odd vegetables such as carrot or parsnips can be added to the stock.
===Chef's note===
Cheat if you are short of time, use stock from a stock-cube and then continue from step 4.  that way you can pretend to everyone that you made it.
