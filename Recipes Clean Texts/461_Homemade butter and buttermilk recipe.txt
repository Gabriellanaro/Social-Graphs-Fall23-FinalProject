It works, but worth doing?

Not sure that buying buttermilk might not be easier and simpler.  If you want to experiment though, this is how to do it.

===Description===

Most people want buttermilk for a bread recipe.  This neat idea gets you not only the buttermilk, but alos the butter to spread on the bread once it's made.  All you need is 700 ml of double cream (heavy cream) and a hand whisk.

Once you over-beat the double cream, the butter begins to separate into buttermilk and butter.

This can be done by hand if you have the time and the energy.  ''tip''; Have an electric whisk to hand for when you give up !

===Ingredients===
| 700 ml double cream
| ¼ to ½ a teaspoon of fine salt, optional for salted butter

===Method===

| Pour the double cream into a large bowl
| Start by using the beating attachment and whisk until the cream starts to solidify - this took about 3 minutes of continual whisking.

| Once the butter starts to appear, I found it easier to continue with the dough-hook attachment as butter starts to clog the whisk.
| To prevent covering the kitchen in buttermilk it's probably a good idea to decant the buttermilk you have at this stage to another container.
| Another few minutes with the dough hook and the separation should be complete.
| Strain off the remaining buttermilk, whisk in a ¼ to ½ a teaspoon of fine salt if you want salted butter.
| On a cool day you can pat the butter into shape.  If it's very warm you can do this by hand in a bowl aof very cold water.
| Use your buttermilk to make the bread and the butter to spread on it

===Chef's notes===
This is probably a long-winded method of making butter, but it's very nice butter and quite fun, if not a little messy.  Let me know if you manage to beat it all by hand!
