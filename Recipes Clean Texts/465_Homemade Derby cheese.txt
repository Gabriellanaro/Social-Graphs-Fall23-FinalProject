Home-made cheese is divine

There is no better feeling than eating cheese you have made yourself.  This was divine! (we don't have a dairy either, so used normal milk.)

===Description===

Traditionally, this cheese is made with 50% evening milk and 50% morning milk.  However, not having my own cows, this is not possible, and unless you live near a farm that is registered to supply unpasteurised milk, probably not for you either.  This version is made with pasteurised shop bought milk.

The quantity given will fit a small Ascott hard cheese mould measuring 82 x 82 x 90 mm.

===Ingredients===
| 4 litres pasteurised full-fat milk
| A small pinch of DVI or 2 ml liquid starter
| 1.5 ml calcium chloride, mixed with a little cooled, boiled water
| 1.5 ml rennet (animal or vegetarian), mixed with a little cooled, boiled water
| Salt
| Brine, made with 180 ml salt [12 level tablespoons] per 1 litre of water


===Mise en place===
* Sterilise all equipment
===Method===


| Heat the milk slowly, using a double boiler until it has reach a temperature of 29 degrees C.
| Stir in the DVI or liquid starter and leave for 15 minutes.
| Add the calcium chloride and stir throughly.
| Stir in the rennet, stir and leave in a warm place for 45-60 minutes, until set.
| Cut the curds into 1.2 cm cubes and slowly heat, stirring until the temperature reaches 36 degrees.  This should take 15 minutes.
| Allow to settle for 15 minutes.
| Drain off as much of the whey as you can and transfer the curds to a piece of cheesecloth.
| Tie the cloth at the top and tighten every 15 minutes for one hour as the whey drains.  A sterilised plastic clothes peg is useful for this.
| Take the curd from the cloth and cut the curd into 4 strips.
| Stack the strips on top of each other and cover.
| After 30 minutes, put the inner curd strips on the outside and leave for another 30 minutes.
| You then need to dry-salt, so weigh the curd, cut it into pea sized pieces. 
| Add the salt.  If you have a kilo of curd, add 14g of salt, or for 500g curd add 7g.  You will need to work this out accurately depending on your exact weight!
| Mix well.
| Line your mould with clean cheesecloth (although personally, I did not actually line mine).
| Press lightly for 1 hour and then increase the pressure a little for each hour afterwards.
| Then leave under full pressure for 24 hours.
| Remove the cheese from the mould, turn, and replace in a clean cheesecloth.
| Press under maximum pressure for a further two days.
| Briefly place the cheese in brine (for about and hour), then seal in water at 66 degrees C for one minute.
| Allow to dry, paint with rapeseed oil and wrap in a bandage until mature - about 2 months.
| Unless you have a cave handy, the fridge is probably the best place to mature your homemade cheese although it's really going to be too cold. After discovering the top shelf of my often-opened fridge could be as much as 5\u00b0 C warmer than the bottom, I've decided to mature my cheeses there.  As all fridges differ, check various areas of your fridge with a thermometer to find the area that is around 11\u00b0C [51\u00b0 F], the ideal 'cave' temperature.
