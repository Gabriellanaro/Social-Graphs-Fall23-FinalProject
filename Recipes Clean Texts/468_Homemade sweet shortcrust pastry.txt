===Ingredients===
| 225 g plain flour, sieved
| 50 g icing sugar
| 115 g cold butter, cut into small chunks
| Grated zest of 1 lemon
| 1 large free range egg, beaten
| Splash of milk
===Method===


| Sieve the flour from a height over a clean work surface
| Repeat with the icing sugar
| Rub the butter into the flour with cold hand, using the tips of your fingers, until the mixture is like breadcrumbs.
| Add your lemon zest or any other flavouring you may be using
| Now add the egg and a tiny splash of milk and combine until you have a ball of dough. Don't overwork the pastry here of you won't get a crumbly pastry
| Keep adding the milk until you can form the mixture into a ball, which will hold together, but not be sticky
| Wrap in cling-film and place in the fridge for half-an-hour before use.
| This can be made in a food processor, in which case process the flour, sugar, egg and butter together, using the pulse setting.  Slowly add the milk and the mixture should automatically form itself into a ball when enough milk has been added.  Do not over-process though, as it will make the mixture too warm.
===Chef's notes===
Once the pastry has rested in the fridge, roll it out according to your recipe's instructions and add the other ingredients.  However, I always put it back in the fridge at this stage for a further 30 minutes, before I put it into the preheated oven.  I do this even with ready-made pastry.
