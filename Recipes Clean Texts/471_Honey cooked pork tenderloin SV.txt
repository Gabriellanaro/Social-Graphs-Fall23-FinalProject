===Description===

Pork tenderloin marinated in honey and cooked sous-vide served with root vegetables
===Ingredients===

| 180g carrots, peeled and cut into batons
| 150g piece of swede, peeled and cubed
| A large knob of butter
| 2 x 225g pieces of pork tenderloin
| 30ml clear honey
| 30ml cold pressed rapeseed oil
| Grated zest of half an orange
| A pinch Chinese five spice
| Salt and pepper
| Italian parsley, finely chopped
===Mise en place===

* Pre-heat the water bath to 84\u00b0C (''183\u00b0F'')

===Method===


| Place the carrots, swede and butter in a vacuum bag.
| Season and seal.
| Add to the water bath and cook for 1\u00bd hours.
| Meanwhile, mix the honey, oil, orange zest, Chinese five spice and seasoning in a bowl.
| Add the pork and coat with the marinade on all sides.
| Cover and place in the fridge for at least 1 hour.
| Place in a vacuum bag and seal.
| Once the cooking time is up for the vegetables, reduce the water bath temperature to 56.5\u00b0C (''134\u00b0F'') (for medium rare) or 60\u00b0C (''140\u00b0F'') (for medium).
| Add the pork to the bath, leaving the pouch containing the vegetables where they are, and cook for 1\u00bd-2\u00bd hours.
| Pre-heat to high, a pan containing a little oil.
| Remove the pouches from the water bath.
| Open and drain the one containing the pork and sear for about 30 seconds on each side.
| Cut the pork into slices and serve with the drained vegetables.
| Sprinkle the vegetables with the chopped parsley
===Serving suggestions===
Serve with mustard sauce

===Variations===
Vary the combination of vegetables, but bear in mind that the pork is orange scented, so beetroot and carrots would go best.  You could replace the orange with herbs.
