Sweet and sour salad. \ud83c\udf6f\ud83c\udf4b\ud83e\udd57

===Description===

This takes fruit salad to the next level. Incredible, zingy, Asian-inspired flavours for something a bit more impressive than your run-of-the-mill fruit salad, and it only takes ten minutes to make.

===Ingredients===

| 5 handfuls of a selection of fruit (opt for 3-4 different varieties if possible)
| 2 tablespoons honey
| 2 teaspoons fresh ginger root, finely chopped or grated
| 1 lime, zest and juice
| A few fresh basil leaves (optional)
| A large handful of cashews, toasted

===Method===


| Cut your fruit into bite-sized bits: Thinly slice your pears, apples or plums. Segment those oranges. Pit your cherries. De-stalk strawberries. (You get the idea.)
| Toss everything in a bowl, or arrange them prettily on a plate.
| Gently warm the honey in a saucepan. Take off the heat. Swirl the ginger through. Grate in some lime zest. Add a good squeeze of juice.
| Drizzle the mix over the fruit. Scatter cashews over the top. Finish with a little fresh basil, if you wish. Pudding ready.
