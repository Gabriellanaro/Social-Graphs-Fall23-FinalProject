===Description===

Think flapjack isn't quite sticky enough? Pear and honey do the trick. No pear to spare? Swap for the same weight of grated apple or mushed up banana.

===Ingredients===

| 125g unsalted butter ''see Chef's notes below''
| 125g brown sugar ''see Chef's notes below''
| 75g honey
| 1 teaspoon vanilla extract or seeds from \u00bd vanilla pod
| 1 lemon, zest only (optional)
| 200g porridge oats
| 1 teaspoon mixed spice
| A pinch of sea salt
| 200g pecan nuts (whole or chopped) and/or seeds
| 150g coarsely grated pear
===Mise en place===

* Preheat the oven to 160\u00b0 C (325\u00b0 F - gas 3), [fan oven 140\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]

===Method===


| Line a 20cm square tin (or something of a similar size) with greaseproof paper or Bake-O-Glide. It makes getting the flapjacks out the tin much easier.
| Melt the butter, sugar, honey, vanilla and lemon zest (if using) a saucepan till the sugar dissolves.
| Mix the oats, mixed spice, a good pinch of sea salt and the nuts/seeds. Fold the grated pear through.
| Stir the melted butter mix through the oat mix till sticky and thick.
| Press the mix into your prepared tin. Place in the centre of the middle shelf. Bake for 30 mins or till the flapjacks are golden on the top and crispy around the edges.
| For best results, allow them to cool fully before cutting into them: tricky, but worth the wait.
===Chef's notes===
*Vegan? Use coconut oil instead. It'll give the flapjacks a softer consistency but it's delicious nonetheless.

*No brown sugar? Use caster or granulated sugar instead. The texture will be slightly softer but they\u0092ll still taste superb.
