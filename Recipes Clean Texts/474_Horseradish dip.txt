===Description===

This horseradish dip can be made as strong as you like, but I find if it contains too much horseradish it is difficult and almost unpleasant to eat.

Five tablespoons of yogurt to an inch of grated frozen horseradish root was perfect. The root is quite thin, about the size of a big fat cigar.

This was great for dipping twice fried, air fried potato chips.

===Ingredients===

| 5 tablespoons of Greek-style yogurt
| 1 inch (2.5 cm) of horseradish root
| 1 teaspoon lime juice
| Pinch of sea salt

===Method===


| Add the yogurt to a serving bowl
| Grate the horseradish root into the yogurt
| Stir in the lime juice and salt and mix well.
| Leave for 10 minutes, or longer, then give it a final mix and serve.
===Variations===
A little chopped fresh parsley can add a little colour without overpowering the dip.
