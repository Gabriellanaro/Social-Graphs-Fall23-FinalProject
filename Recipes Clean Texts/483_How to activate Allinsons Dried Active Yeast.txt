Not sure why but the labelling on this product used to make very clear that it was not suitable for breadmakers, now it just about whispers it.  Not Good Guys!

===Description===

I thought I had a problematic batch of yeast so I returned it to Allinson (The Silver Spoon Company) as faulty.  They tested it and even baked a loaf of bread with it.  it transpires that Allinsons Dried Active Yeast is unsuitable for breadmakers and needs to be ''activated'' first.  These instructions are verbatim from Allinson - Jane Johnson; Customer Quality Co-ordinator. 
===Ingredients===

| 1 teaspoon sugar
| 150 ml warm water (1 part boiling, 2 parts cold)
| 15 g Allinson's dried active yeast

===Method===


| Dissolve the sugar in warm water
| Sprinkle in the dried active yeast and whisk thoroughly.
| Leave in a warm place until the surface is covered in froth. This usually takes 15 minutes.
| Whisk again and use immediately.
| Liquid used to activate '''should not''' be used in addition to the amount of liquid in the recipe.
===Chef's notes===
Like me, you were probably not aware that this was necessary as I had been using this yeast in our breadmaker for years and years.  However, the loaves are much better after following this procedure.
