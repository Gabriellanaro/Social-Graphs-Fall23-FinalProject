Better than oven, grilling or toasting

===Description===

Cook taco shells in your air fryer; the result is way superior to using a micro wave and they even go a little toasty!
===Ingredients===

| A 12 pack of Asda taco shells
| These are much cheaper than El Paso and just as good

===Method===


| Tip the taco shells into your air fryer basket
| Air fry for 15 minutes at 180\u00b0 C
| Serve immediately
