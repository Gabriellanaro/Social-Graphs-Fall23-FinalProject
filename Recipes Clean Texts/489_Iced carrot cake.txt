I wonder if this recipe came about because of wartime rationing?

===Description===

Another recipe from Mum's scribbled cookery notes, this one for an carrot cake with orange icing.  In her hey-day she would have used a hand whisk, it's probably easier and quicker to use an electric whisk.  I also use a food processor to grate carrots but that's because I like playing with kitchen toys!
