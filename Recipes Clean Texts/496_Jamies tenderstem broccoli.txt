[[Image:Jamie's tenderstem broccoli recipe ingredients.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The ingredients - Only half of the wine was used (frozen leftovers)]]
During one of Jamie Oliver's 15 minute meals he used tender-stem broccoli (purple sprouting broccoli) in a spaghetti dish, I think.  Halving the stems to ensure they cook quickly seemed a clever idea to me so I thought I would try it as a standalone vegetable accompaniment. I'm pretty sure that Jamie used sliced chilli as well as garlic, but this is to accompany Spicy lamb meatball potato and onion hotpot which already has a chilli kick so left it out.

The tiny bunch of purple sprouting broccoli seemed expensive at \u00a31.50, but as I was prepping it, it was plain it would easily serve 4 people, so not too expensive after all.

If you are not too keen on really crunchy stems, I would be inclined to blanch the slices broccoli for a few minutes before pan frying it.

===Ingredients===

| A teaspoon of olive oil
| Half a small bunch of tenderstem broccoli (purple sprouting broccoli)
| A sprig of rosemary
| 4 cloves of garlic, peeled and crushed
| 100 ml white wine
| 5 ml Light soy sauce

===Method===


| Carefully slice tenderstem broccoli lengthwise along the whole length if each stem
| Heat a frying pan or wok over a high heat with a teaspoon of olive oil. just enough to prevent it sticking but not so that it is greasy
| Strip the leaves from the rosemary and add them to the pan together with the broccoli
| Toss the pan and keep turning the broccoli for about 5 minutes then reduce the heat to low
| Add the crushed garlic and stir it or toss the pan so it cooks evenly
| The moment it starts to take any colour, add the white wine and cover
| Leave covered for 5 minutes or so until most of the wine has reduced
| Add a splash of soy sauce and serve immediately
===Chef's notes===
If you prefer your broccoli soft and not crunchy, blanch it in boiling water for a few minutes beforehand
