===Description===

I saw this recipe on Jamie Oliver's ''At Home'' series and thought to myself: we'll have this on Saturday night!!  So here is what I remember of the program.

It uses shoulder of lamb, which, because of the time spent cooking at a very low heat, will be tender and just fall off the bone when the dish is done.

Cooking does not get much simpler (and tastier) than this!

We have a large selection of '''slow roast recipes''' that are similar to this one.

===Ingredients===
| 1.5 kg shoulder of lamb on the bone
| 1 whole garlic bulb
| Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
| Lots and lots of fresh of rosemary stems.
| Olive oil for drizzling

'''For the hot caper and mint sauce'''
* 1 tablespoon plain flour
* 2 big handfuls of freshly picked mint leaves
* 4 tablespoons capers
* 1 pint of chicken stock
* 2 tablespoons sherry vinegar

===Mise en place===
* Preheat the oven to its '''hottest''' setting.

===Method===


| With a sharp knife, score the skin of the joint every 2.5 cm (1\"). Cut about halfway through the fat.
| Using plenty of salt and pepper, season the lamb on both sides, ensuring you get plenty into the slashes you have made.
| Smash the garlic bulb to separate all of the cloves and place half of them, unpeeled, in the base of a suitable sized roasting tray.
| Distribute most of the rosemary stems evenly into the base of the tray.
| Sit the meat, skin-side upwards, into the roasting tray and place the remaining garlic cloves on the top of the skin, together with the remaining rosemary stems.
| Drizzle 3 or 4 tablespoons of olive oil over the skin of the lamb.
| Cover with 2 layers of tin-foil and fold the edges over the edge of the roasting tin to ensure a good seal.
| Check that the oven has reached its highest temperature and place the joint in the oven on the top shelf and '''immediately turn the oven down to 160\u00b0 C (325\u00b0 F - gas 3)'''
| Leave to roast slowly for 4 hours.
| After 4 hours, remove the lamb, together with the garlic, and put the meat on a preheated plate. Cover loosely with a piece of foil and leave to rest for a while before carving and serving with the sauce. 

'''To make the hot mint and caper sauce'''
# Discard most of the rosemary and any excess oil, leaving just the lovely caramelised juices from the roasting.
# Heat the roasting tray on the hob and add a tablespoon of plain flour and stir well to soak up all of the lovely juices.
# Roughly chop the mint leaves and the capers and add to the roasting tray.
# Squeeze a few of the roasted garlic cloves into the gravy.
# Add the chicken stock to the tray, stirring well to thicken, but don't cook it for ages.
# Add a final splash of sherry vinegar to the gravy, stir and serve.

===Serving suggestions===

Serve hot with squash mash and Parmesan turnip tops.

===Chef's note===
If you are using a smaller joint then you can reduce the cooking time; a small (800g) joint would only need half the cooking time.  However, it wont hurt to cook it longer as it will just do a better job of breaking down the collagen and sinews.  It's also worth noting that Lamb is safe to eat rare.

Don't be put off a recipe that calls for a leg of lamb because of the high cost.  This recipe can be adjusted for half a leg of lamb and you buy that (frozen) for just \u00a36.00! (March 2013).
