Just as great with normal ham

Made this with Morrison's ham-offcuts and it was even better than with prosciutto.

I saw Jamie Oliver make this on a recent TV program, it might have been 15 minute meals.

This is my lazy version of a similar recipe.  The feta cheese adds a really interesting flavour, sour, almost lemon-like.  I only used 150g of pork fillet as that was what was in the freezer.  As it was it was plenty for 2 people.

Next time I would try this with a nice ham or very thinly sliced bacon. Prosciutto is probably a bit fiddly for this recipe.  jamie made an impression with his thumb to put the cheese in; I found using cocktail sticks meant that you could leave the cheese as photographed here.
===Ingredients===

| 2 tablespoons of olive oil
| Pinch of freshly ground black pepper
| 150 g pork fillet (half of 1 fillet, sliced lengthwise)
| 100g feta cheese (half a pack)
| 1 pack of prosciutto (or thinly sliced streaky bacon, see above)
| 2 medium onions, peeled and chopped
| A good pinch of dried oregano

===Method===


| Cut the pork fillet into squares
| Spread the pork fillet pieces evenly on a chopping board and cover with a silicone baking mat (or clingfilm) and bash flat with a rolling pin
| Measure out your feta cheese and put the pack back in the fridge - it's very easy to get the cheese cross-contaminated in preparing a recipe like this.
| Meanwhile gently fry the onions in a little olive oil.
| Roughly distribute the cheese on the flattened pork squares - you don't have to be that neat, the cocktail sticks will save the day!
| Shake dried oregano and black pepper over the cheese.
| Roll up each square in a sheet of prosciutto (or bacon) and pin with a cocktail stick.
| Leaving the onions in th epan, place each pice of pork in the pan making sure it contacts the base of the pan.
| Pan-fry for about 5 minutes.
| Tun over and fry the other side for a further 5 minutes.
| Pick the thickest piece of pork to make sure it's properly cooked.
| Serve!
===Serving suggestions===
Serve with mashed potatoes, vegetables and onion gravy.
