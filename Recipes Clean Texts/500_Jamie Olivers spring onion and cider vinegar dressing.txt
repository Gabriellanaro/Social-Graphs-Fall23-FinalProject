===Description===


This is an interesting dressing, it's so simple that it's hardly a recipe.

It originated as one of the accompaniments for Jamie Oliver's recipe: Guinness lamb shanks with dark sticky gravy but would go well with any fatty meat or oily fish dishes.

===Ingredients===
| 3 large spring onions
| 5 tablespoons cider vinegar
| A pinch of salt
===Method===


| Finely chop the spring onions
| Mix with up to 5 tablespoons of cider and a pinch of salt
===Serving suggestions===
This is nice with a fatty meat dish like lamb and would even be quite nice with an oily fish like mackerel.
