I've tried this recipe with all sorts of beans and pulses and it works well with them all.  You may need to adjust cooking and soaking times though.

===Description===

I saw Jamie Oliver cooking  cannellini beans as 'Humble home-cooked beans in his Jamie at Home TV series. I thought I would try a pink version using kidney beans - very nice they are too.

The potato adds some substance to the sauce, the tomato helps to break down the beans and the garlic and herbs add bags of flavour.

This would be great as garlicky beans on toast or as an addition to any meal.
===Ingredients===

| 500g pack of dried kidney beans - you'll find the KTC beans in the Asian section of your supermarket, very reasonably priced too!
| 8 cloves of garlic, unpeeled
| A few small tomatoes
| A sprig of rosemary
| A sprig of thyme
| A handful of bay leaves
| 1 small potato, peeled and quartered
| 1 small stick of celery, I've used frozen celery
| A large bunch of fresh parsley, finely chopped
| 5 tablespoons olive oil
| 2 tablespoons red wine vinegar
| Salt and pepper
===Mise en place===

* Soak the kidney beans in lots of fresh water for 24 hours (or more).  Change the water and rinse them well at least 3 or 4 times during the soaking.
* Do not add any salt during this process as this will inhibit the re-hydration process.

===Method===


| Drain the kidney beans after they have soaked for 24 hours.
| Put them in a big pot and cover with cold water.
| Add the herbs, apart from the parsley, garlic, potato, celery and a good pinch of black pepper. Again do not add any salt at this stage.
| Cover, bring to the boil and simmer gently for about an hour. Skim and discard any scum that rises to the surface.
| After an hour, drain the beans, reserving the liquor.
| Discard the celery stick and the herbs.
| In a separate bowl, add the potato.
| Squeeze the garlic from the cloves over the potatoes and discard the skins.
| Do the same with the tomatoes, again, discarding the skins.
| Add a small ladle-full of the cooking liquor, a good pinch of salt and pepper and using a potato masher, mix into a runny sauce.
| Add this mixture back into the drained beans and add the chopped parsley, olive oil and red wine vinegar and mix really well.
| Add a little more liquor if needed.
===Serving suggestions===
Serve on toast, garnished with fresh parsley.

===Variations===
Any variety of dried beans will work well, they just won't be pink if they are not kidney beans!
