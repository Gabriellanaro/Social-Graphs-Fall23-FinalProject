With a name like that it just has to be British!! Usually served with English homemade custard!

===Ingredients===
| 250 g (8 oz) self-raising flour
| 125 g (4 oz)  shredded suet - eg: Atora
| 8 tablespoons water
| 4 tablespoons raspberry jam
| 1 egg, beaten
| Caster sugar for dusting
| Milk for brushing
| Pinch of table salt
===Method===


| Preheat the oven to 200\u00b0 C (400\u00b0 F - gas 6 - Moderately hot)
| In a sieve, sift the flour into a bowl with the pinch of table salt
| Add the water and suet and knead to make a soft, dryish dough - not sticky
| Tip the dough onto a floured surface and roll into a rectangle, about 20 cm x 30 cm (8\" x 12\")
| Warm the jam for a few seconds in the microwave or over a bowl of hot water so it can be brushed easily
| Brush the jam onto the pastry., leaving a 1 cm (1/2\") gap all around the edges
| Brush the border with milk
| With the short side nearest you, loosely roll up, away from you
| Lightly pinch the edges to seal
| Sit the roly-poly (long sealed edge) on a greased baking sheet
| Brush with the beaten egg and sprinkle with caster sugar
| Bake in the oven for 35 to 40 minutes. It should be golden brown when done
===Serving suggestions===

Sprinkle with a little caster sugar and serve hot with homemade custard
===Shelf life===
I have found that packet suet has a limited shelf life once opened. I thought I was unable to make decent dumplings until I threw out what turned out to be rancid suet and made them with a fresh packet!
