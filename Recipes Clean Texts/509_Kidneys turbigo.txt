===Description===

[[Image:Kidneys turbigo ingredients.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The ingredients]]
I remember my mum used to cook kidney turbigo when we were small children and I even remember it being spicy.  This is as close to her recipe that I have been able to get to the recipe she used to make.

===Ingredients===
| 12 shallots
| 50 g (2 oz) butter
| Olive oil for frying
| 6 lambs kidneys, washed, skinned, cored and cut into small chunks
| 1 pack of thin chipolata sausages (about 340 g)
| 150 g fresh button mushrooms, quartered
| 2 teaspoons plain flour 
| 1 teaspoon tomato puree
| 1 tablespoons of sherry
| 1 tablespoon of sherry vinegar
| 284 ml (1/2 pint) beef stock
| Good splash of Louisiana hot pepper sauce or Tabasco sauce
| 1 bay leaf
| sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
| 2 tablespoons freshly chopped parsley
===Method===


| Blanch the shallots in boiling salted water for 2 minutes, drain and peel - it's easier after they have been blanched. Set aside.
| Heat a splash of olive oil in a pan and saut\u00e9 the kidneys and sausages on a fairly high heat until browned all over. Lift out the kidneys and sausages with a slotted spoon and set aside. I prefer to discard the juice and fat at this stage.
| Give the pan a wipe round, add 50 g of butter and add the onions and mushrooms. Saut\u00e9 for 5 minutes, stirring often.
| Leaving the mushrooms and onions in the pan, remove it from the heat and stir in the flour.
| Deglaze the pan with the sherry and the sherry vinegar, add tomato puree, stock and bay leaf, 1 tablespoon of the parsley and season to taste with salt and pepper
| Cut the sausages in half or smaller pieces if you wish.
| Return to the heat, bring to the boil and return the kidneys and sausages, reduce the heat, cover and simmer for 40 minutes.
| Discard the bay leaf and serve immediately, sprinkled with the remaining parsley.
===Serving suggestions===
The classic accompaniment for this dish is fried croutons, but I prefer it with peas and mashed potatoes.  Plain tortilla chips would be a nice side dish for this.
===Variations===
A few rashers of home smoked bacon added with the sausages would go well with this.
