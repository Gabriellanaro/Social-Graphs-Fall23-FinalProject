===Description===

You may see this mentioned in some historic recipe books.  Use to dust parsnips and carrots before roasting them.  

Also good in bean stews and casseroles.

===Ingredients===
| 1 tablespoon black peppercorns
| 2 whole nutmegs
| 3 teaspoons ginger powder
| 1 tablespoon anise
| 1 tablespoon coriander seeds
| 2 tablespoons clove buds
===Method===


| Cover the nutmegs with a strong tea-towel and smash with a rolling pin
| Add all the spices and the nutmeg shards to a coffee grinder and reduce to a powder
| Store in an airtight container for up to 4 months
===Chef's notes===
If you cannot get anise, use an equivalent amount of anise-like spices such as fennel, star-anise, aniseed myrtle, etc.
