===Description===


A nice variation on bangers and mash.

===Ingredients===
| 500g sweet potatoes, peeled and cut into even-sized chunks 
| 300g floury potatoes, peeled and cut into even-sized chunks 
| Â¼ teaspoon ground cumin 
| 50g butter 
| 1 tablespoon olive oil 
| 8 lamb sausages 
| 1 jar Belazu Balsamic onions in balsamic vinegar 
| 1 tablespoon redcurrant jelly
===Method===


| Place the sweet potatoes and floury potatoes in a large saucepan and cover with water. 
| Bring to the boil and simmer, covered, for 15-20mins, until fully cooked and tender. 
| Drain and return to the pan. 
| Mash the potatoes and stir in the ground cumin and butter until smooth. 
| Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper and keep warm.
| Meanwhile, heat the oil in a large frying pan over a medium heat, and cook the sausages for 5 mins on each side. Add the onions with their balsamic liquor and bring to the boil. Lower the heat and simmer for 5 mins until the sausages are cooked and sauce reduced. 
| Stir in the redcurrant jelly and season to taste. 
===Serving suggestions===
* Serve with the sweet potato mash and some blanched spinach.

===Variations===
If like me, you're not so keen on sweet potatoes, try using any variety of squash instead.  The cooking times will be similar.
