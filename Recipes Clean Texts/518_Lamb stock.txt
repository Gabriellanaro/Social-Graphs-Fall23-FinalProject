Stocks are a fiddle to make and this, I'm afraid is no exception. However, if you want a recipe for restaurant quality lamb stock, this is it.  Freeze in plastic or paper vending-type coffee cups and you won't have to use an stock cubes for months!

===Ingredients===
| 900 g (2 lb) lamb bones and meat trimmings with any excess fat removed. This calls for a trip to your friendly local butcher!
| Half an an onion, peeled and chopped
| 1 carrot, peeled and chopped
| 1 stick of celery, with leaves, chopped
| 4 button mushrooms, brushed clean and halved
| 2.25 litres (4 pints) of cold water
| 1 sprig of thyme
| 1 sprig of mint
| 2 Cloves of garlic, with skins, smashed
| 1 bay leaf


===Mise en place===
* Preheat the oven to  204\u00b0 C (400\u00b0 F - Gas 6)

===Method===


| Place the bones in  a large Roasting tray and roast for 40 minutes
| Drain any fat and reserve
| Add the bones and the remaining ingredients to the largest pan you have, bring to the boil, reduce the heat and simmer uncovered for 3 hours, skimming any scum or surface fat as it appears
| Allow to cool slightly and strain being careful not to disturb the ingredients or force them through the sieve
| Allow to cool properly and remove the remaining surface fat
| Refrigerate or freeze in plastic coffee cups until required
