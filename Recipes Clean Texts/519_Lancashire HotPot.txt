A meat and potato casserole.  This recipe is from ''The Main Cookery Book'' (edition unknown, but ''c''.1939).  It was first published in 1929.

===Ingredients===
| 1 lb [450 g] neck of mutton
| 2 onions
| 2 sheep's kidneys
| ½ pint [280 ml] warm water [or stock]
| 2 lb [900 g] potatoes
| Seasoning
| ½ oz [15 g] melted butter
===Method===


| Skin and core the kidneys, and cut the meats into small neat pieces.
| Wash, peel and slice the potatoes, and slice the onions.
| Line the casserole with a layer of these vegetables.
| Season well and fill the casserole with layers of meat, vegetables and seasonings.
| Pour on the water [or stock].
| Have a layer of potatoes on top, brush over with a little melted butter, cover with a \"lid\" of buttered paper, or the lid of the casserole, and cook for half-an-hour at fairly hot [220 C/425 F/Gas 7], then for 1½ hours in a slow oven [150 C/300 F/Gas 2].
| Remove the lid, and continue cooking for a further half hour to brown the top layer.
===Variations===
This is a very traditional and basic recipe.  Nowadays other root vegetables and herbs are included and neck of lamb takes the place of mutton.
