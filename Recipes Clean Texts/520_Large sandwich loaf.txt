===Description===

[[Image:The crumb.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The crumb]]
This loaf is baked in a 1.8kg (4lb) loaf tin and these are produced by Alan Silverwood.  Grease the tin well with groundnut oil.  Start making this the evening before you want to eat the bread.

===Ingredients===
| 1kg strong white bread flour
| 650ml cold water
| 50g butter
| 7g dried yeast
| 2 teaspoons salt
===Method===


| Mix the flour and water and leave to autolyse for 30 minutes.
| Incorporate the butter, yeast and salt and then knead according to your chosen method.
| Shape into a ball, place in a bowl, cover and refrigerate overnight.
| The next morning, remove from the fridge and wait until the dough has risen sufficiently.
| Divide the dough into 4 equal pieces and shape into balls.
| Place the balls, side by side, in the greased loaf tin, cover, and leave to rise until almost double in size.
| Preheat the oven to 230\u00b0 C (450\u00b0 F - gas 8), [fan oven 210\u00b0 C].
| Shake some flour over the top.
| Place the bread in the oven and reduce the temperature to 200\u00b0 C (400\u00b0 F - gas 6), [fan oven 180\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour].
| Bake for about 50 minutes.
