===Description===


These rolls are very easy to make and the idea has been taken from Richard Berthinet's '''Dough''' (ISBN 9781856267625).  I have started by making an overnight sponge, to encourage yeast activity, but you can omit that stage if you like and mix in all the ingredients at the same time.

See 'Variations' below for instructions on partially making these rolls in a breadmaker, food mixer and Thermomix.

===Ingredients===TM
| 10g fresh yeast
| 350g sparkling mineral water
| 500g strong bread flour - you may need to use more water if using very strong bread flour
| 10g salt
===Method===


| The night before you want to bake the bread, dissolve the yeast in the water,
| Sieve 250g flour into a large bowl and stir in the water and dissolved yeast.  Do NOT add the salt at this stage as its will interfere with yeast activity.
| Mix thoroughly.
| Cover with clingfilm and leave at room temperature overnight.
| If it becomes very active, refrigerate and bring to room temperature in the morning.
| The next day, sieve the remaining 250g flour with the salt and add to the bowl.
| Mix thoroughly and leave to rest for 20 minutes.  The dough should be fairly sticky, so add more water if necessary.
| Knead, using your desired method until you have an elastic dough.
| Shape into a ball and leave it to rest for an hour in an oiled bowl, covered with clingfilm, until the dough has almost doubled in size.
| Lightly flour a work surface and gently deflate the dough.
| Knead briefly and repeat the two previous steps.
| Gently spread the dough on a floured work surface and roll out until it is about 5mm thick.
| Using a plain 6cm pastry cutter cut out circles of dough and place them on a baking tray.
| Lightly dampen the circles with water.
| Cut out the equivalent number of circles again and place on top of the others.
| Dampen the top circles and go through the same process a 3rd time.
| Cover with a damp cloth and leave to prove for up to 45 minutes.
| Bake at 230\u00b0 C (450\u00b0 F - gas 8), [fan oven 210\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour] for 15-20 minutes. 
| Allow to cool on a wire rack.
===Variations===
* Stages 1-11 can be done in a food mixer.
* Stages 6-11 can be done in a breadmaker on the longest dough setting.
*Stages 1-11 can also be done in a Thermomix. Add the sponge ingredients all together, having dissolved the yeast. Mix for 6-20 seconds at Speed 3 until the dough has formed into a ball that begins to clean the sides of the bowl. Add the remaining flour and the salt the next day and knead for 90 seconds at the kneading setting. Tip the TM bowl upside down on a lightly floured surface . Loosen the blades by undoing the blade unit at the base. The weight of the blades will help the dough to drop out of the bowl onto the surface. Pull any remaining bits of dough off the blades and out of the bowl. Continue from step 12. 
===Chef's notes===
You will find that the rolls slant somewhat during rising but that is part of their charm!  The more they slant, the longer they may need baking.
