| Toss the contents to mix well and roast for 20 minutes.
| Reduce the heat to 200\u00b0 C (400\u00b0 F - gas 6), [fan oven 180\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]
| Cut a deep slit in each chicken breast and fill with a bay leaf between two slices of lemon, drizzle with the  white wine or stock and return to the oven for 25 to 30 minutes, basting now and then until the chicken is properly cooked.
===Serving suggestions===
On its own or maybe with a small green salad

===Chef's notes===
The alert amongst you will notice these are not new potatoes but what was in the kitchen at the time.  Cut large potatoes into   fairly small even-sized pieces so they cook at the same rate.

If you have free access to fresh bay leaves, use them!  Scatter a handful into the vegetable mix at the start.  The same for any left over lemon pieces, squeeze the lemon juice over the vegetables and scatter the pieces over the vegetables.  They can be discarded at before serving but they add a little more aroma and flavour to the dish.

Not being a white-wine drinker, but having sherry for cooking, if white wine is called for I often mix dry sherry with a little water instead.
