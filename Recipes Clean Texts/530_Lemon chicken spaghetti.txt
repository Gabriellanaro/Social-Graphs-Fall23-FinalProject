===Description===

A different way to make a simple evening meal with spaghetti and chicken.
===Ingredients===

| 2 onions, peeled and chopped
| 4 cloves of garlic, peeled and crushed
| 2 tablespoons olive oil
| Pinch of black pepper
| 700 g boneless chicken breasts cut into bite-sized pieces
| Juice from half a lemon plus a little zest
| 2 tablespoons fresh parsley, chopped
| Pinch of sea salt
| 5 spring onions, chopped
| 4 tablespoons creme fraiche 
| 400 g dried spaghetti

===Method===


| Add the olive oil to a pan or wok together with a pinch of black pepper
| Sautee the onions for 3 or 4 minutes over a medium heat, then add the garlic for a minute or two, stirring so it does not catch
| Add the chicken, lemon juice and zest and cook over a low heat for 15 to 20 minutes until the chicken is properly cooked
| Meanwhile cook the spaghetti in salted boiling water for 7 to 10 minutes
| Stir in the creme fraiche and spring onions and season to taste
===Serving suggestions===
You can serve the sauce over the spaghetti or mix it in, whatever takes your fancy.

A few tomatoes make a refreshing accompaniment to this recipe.
===Variations===
We done this twice now, the second time with fresh thyme instead of parsley.  About a teaspoonful of freshly picked leaves was very nice.
