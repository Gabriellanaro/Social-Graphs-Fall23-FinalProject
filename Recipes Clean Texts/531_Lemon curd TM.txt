===Description===

I loathe shop-bought lemon curd and hadn't eaten it for years, until I made this recipe, which is delicious.

===Ingredients===TM

| 75g sugar
| The rind of 1 large, unwaxed lemon, thinly peeled
| 40g lemon juice from the above
| 2 large eggs
| 50g unsalted butter

===Method===


| Put the sugar and the rind into the bowl '''20 seconds / Speed 10'''
| Add the remaining ingredients '''10 seconds / Speed 6'''
| Scrape down the inside of the bowl '''5 minutes / 80\u00b0C / Speed 4''' - you may wish the mixture to be thicker or runnier, in which case adjust the cooking time by a minute or two.
| Transfer to a bowl and allow to cool before use.
| If you want to keep it, tip into sterlised jars or Lock&Lock tubs and refrigerate.
