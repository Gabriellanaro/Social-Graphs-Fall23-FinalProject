The classic British dessert, this version includes the recipe for the filling.  You could cheat of course, and use lemon curd and pre-rolled pastry.

'''pastry'''
===Ingredients===
| 175g plain flour
| 100g butter, straight from the fridge and cut into small pieces
| 1 tablespoon icing sugar
| 1 egg yolk [reserve white for meringue]
'''filling'''
===Ingredients===NB
| level tablespoons cornflour
| 100g golden caster sugar
| zest from 2 large lemons
| strained juice from 2 large lemons
| strained juice from 1 orange
| 85g butter, cut into small pieces
| 1 whole egg and 3 yolks [reserve whites for the meringue]
'''meringue'''
===Ingredients===NB
| 4 egg whites at room temperature
| 200g golden caster sugar
| 2 level teaspoons cornflour


===Mise en place===
* Preheat the oven to 200\u00b0 C (400\u00b0 F - gas 6)
===Method===

'''pastry'''

| Add the flour, butter, sugar and egg yolk to a food processor with a plastic blade and pulse the mixture until it binds together.  Don't over-work it.
| Roll out to fit a 23 cm fluted non-stick baking tin, ideally with a loose bottom for easy release.
| Prick the base with a fork and chill for at least 30 minutes.
| Blind bake the case for about 20 minutes or until golden.
'''filling'''

| Mix the lemon zest, cornflour and sugar in a medium pan and gradually add the lemon juice.
| Separately, mix the orange juice with enough water to make 200 ml.  Add this to the pan. Cook this over a medium heat until it thickens, stirring all the while.
| Remove from the heat and stir in the butter
| Beat the 3 yolks and whole egg together and add to pan.
| Return to a medium heat and stir constantly until the mixture bubbles and thickens.
| Remove from the heat and set aside.
'''meringue'''

| Add the whites to a large bowl and whisk to soft peaks with an electric mixer.
| Try not to overwork the meringue from now on.
| Mix the sugar with the cornflour and add a spoonful at a time, lightly whisking between each addition.
'''baking the pie'''

| Reheat the filling if needed and pour into the pastry case.
| Top with the meringue mixture by adding a spoonful at a time. Start around the edges and work into the centre to prevent the meringue from sinking into the filling.
| Give the pie a final jiggle before you bake in the centre of the oven for 18 to 20 minutes or until the peaks colour slightly.
| Remove from the oven and rest for 30 minutes before removing from the baking tray.
| It's best to leave for another 30 minutes before slicing.
