[[Image:Lentil lasagne2.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The interior]]
Lentils often sound boring, but used this way they are delicious especially if made with earthy Puy lentils (Lentilles vertes du Puy)

===Ingredients===

| 350g Puy lentils
| 125g Parmesan or Grana Padano cheese (for a vegetarian alternative, use Bookham's Twineham Grange cheese)
| 30g butter
| 2 tablespoons olive oil
| 1 large onion, thickly sliced
| Garlic to taste, thickly sliced
| 2 teaspoons ground coriander
| 600g vegetable stock
| Seasoning
| 40g plain flour
| 40g butter
| Freshly ground white pepper
| Freshly ground nutmeg - use plenty
| 600g milk
| Lasagne sheets (use the ones that don't require cooking first)
| Extra butter for dotting (optional)

===Method===


| Wash the lentils and put them in a jug covered with boiling water.
| Meanwhile cut the cheese into chunks, add to the bowl '''6 seconds / Speed 10''''''Bold text'''
| Remove from the bowl and reserve
| Add the butter, oil, onion and garlic to the TM bowl '''25 minutes / Speed 1 / Temp Varoma / Reverse blade / MC off''', but increase to '''Speed 2 for the last 10 minutes'''
| Drain the lentils and add to the bowl '''2 minutes / Speed 2 / 100\u00b0 C / Reverse blade / MC off'''
| Add the coriander and vegetable stock '''25 minutes / Speed 2 / 100\u00b0 C  / Reverse blade / MC off''' - much of the liquid should have been absorbed.  If not, increase the cooking time, but watch it because you don't want the mixture to be totally absorbed
| Season to taste, but bear in mind that the cheese will be salty
| Remove from the bowl and reserve
| Rinse the bowl so that any traces of the lentils mixture have disappeared (no need for a thorough wash)
| Add the butter, flour, pepper, nutmeg and milk to the rinsed out bowl '''7 minutes / Speed 4 / 90\u00b0 C / MC on'''
| In the meantime, preheat the oven 200\u00b0 C (400\u00b0 F - gas 6), [fan oven 180\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]
'''To prepare for the oven '''

| Take a lasagne or baking dish and pour half of the lentil mixture into the bottom - spread it out fairly evenly
| Cover with lasagne sheets
| Pour half of the sauce over the sheets, then top with half of the grated cheese
| Add the remaining lentils, lasagne sheets, sauce and cheese as just described
| Dot the top layer of cheese with butter if desired.
| Bake for about 45 minutes

===Chef's notes===
The timing for cooking the lentils is approximate and you may find that you will need a little less stock or a shorter cooking time.  Puy lentils are cooked in 20-25 minutes if boiled, so try not to overcook them, especially as they have had a short soaking beforehand.  Just don't let the mixture get too dry and bear in mind that the liquid will continue to evaporate whilst making the b\u00e9chamel sauce.
