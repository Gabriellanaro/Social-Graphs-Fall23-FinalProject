Tastes fab too.  I marinate mine for 24 hours or more though.

===Description===


London broil is a North American beef dish made by grilling marinated flank steak, then cutting it against the grain into thin strips.

The name generally refers to the marination method rather than the cut of beef.

This recipe can also be cooked on a barbecue.

Please ensure that you rest the meat for at least 10 minutes before serving.  It won't go cold and this method ensures a tender steak that is not too bloody.

===Ingredients===

| 900g (2 lb) Flank steak
| Juice and zest from 1 lemon (or lime)
| 5 tablespoons olive oil
| 4 fat cloves of garlic, peeled and crushed
| 4 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
| 3 tablespoons dijon mustard
| 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
| 1 tablespoon light soy sauce
| 1 teaspoon chilli powder
| 1 teaspoon dried oregano
| 1 teaspoon dried thyme
| Splash of good chilli sauce (to taste)

===Method===


| Place all of the ingredients in a shallow Lock & Lock style box.
| Shake vigorously for a minute.
| Refrigerate for 12 hours, shaking and turning now and then.
| Prepare a very hot grill, barbecue or griddle pan
| Grill for 3 to 4 minutes per side (or to your liking)
| Allow the cooked meat joint to rest for 10 minutes in a warm place.
| Slicing the meat against (across) the grain will give you the most tender cuts of meat.
===Serving suggestions===
Serve with horseradish cream, thrice cooked chips and a green salad.
