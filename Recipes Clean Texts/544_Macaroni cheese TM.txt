===Description===

This recipe is for a delicious macaroni cheese made in a Thermomix.  It is more time consuming than most, but is well worth the effort and the first two stages can be made in advance.
===Ingredients===TM
====For the cheese topping====
===Ingredients===NB
| 120g Cheddar and / or mature Swiss cheese, cut into chunks
| 30g water
| 1.25g sodium citrate
| 50g tapioca flour (starch)
| 50g panko
====For the macaroni====
===Ingredients===NB
| 1.5kg water
| \u00bd teaspoons salt
| 200g macaroni or other short pasta tubes
| A little flavourless oil
====For the cheese sauce====
===Ingredients===NB
| 270g mixed extra mature Cheddar and Parmesan, cut into chunks
| 185g full fat milk
| 13g sodium citrate
| 80g full fat cream cheese

===Mise en place===

* Pre-heat the oven to 180\u00b0 C (350\u00b0 F - gas 4), [fan oven 160\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]

===Method===


| Put the cheese into the bowl 5 seconds / Speed 5
| Remove from the bowl and divide into 100g and 20g.  Reserve.
| Add the water to the bowl with the sodium citrate '''2 minutes 30 seconds / 98\u00b0 C / Speed 2'''
| Add the cheese, a little at a time '''3-4 minutes / 98\u00b0 C / Speed 2'''.  Make sure that each addition of cheese is melted and smooth before adding the next.
| Add the tapioca flour, a third at a time '''5 minutes / 98\u00b0 C / Speed 2'''.
| Empty onto a sheet of Bake-O-Glide or silicone mat whilst still warm.
| Soread out the mixture until thin and even.
| Place the sheet onto a baking tray and bake until completely dry and golden brown for about 25-40 minutes.
| Allow to cool and break into pieces.
| Place in the bowl and blitz '''10 Seconds / Speed 10''' (or use a spice grinder)
| Add the remaining cheese and the panko and mix '''6 Seconds / Speed 3'''
| Refigerate in an airtight container until needed.
| The cheese topping will keep for 2-3 days.
====For the macaroni====

| Chill a metal baking sheet in the freezer for a minimum of 30 minutes.
| Boil the water in the TM jug and add salt '''11 minutes / 98\u00b0C / Speed 2''' then add pasta. 
| Cook '''3 minutes / 98\u00b0C / Speed Spoon / Reverse Blade''', turning down to 90\u00b0C if it bubbles up onto TM lid.
| Drain (do not rinse) and spread on the baking sheet in a single layer.
| Leave the pasta to cool for 5 minutes, then transfer to a bowl.
| Lightly dress in the oil, cover and refrigerate until ready for use.
====For the cheese sauce====

| In a dry bowl, grate the hard cheese '''7 seconds / Speed 5'''.
| Remove and reserve. 
| Put the milk and sodium citrate into the bowl '''3 minutes 30 seconds / 98\u00b0 C / Speed 2'''.
| Keeping the '''same speed and temperature''', gradually add the hard and cream cheeses and mix until they have melted and the mixture is smooth - about 4 minutes.
| Leave to cool very slighty.
====To assemble and bake====

| Pre-heat the oven to 220\u00b0 C (425\u00b0 F - gas 7), [fan oven 200\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]
| Mix the cheese sauce with the pasta and tip into a casserole dish.
| Sprinkle the cheese crumble mixture over the top.
| Bake for about 15 minutes covered then remove the lid and bake for a further 10 minutes or until the top is golden brown.
| Serve whilst still hot.
===Serving suggestions===
This is very filling, so best served with just salad.
