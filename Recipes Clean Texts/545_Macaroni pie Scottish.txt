===Recipe for Scottish macaroni pie===
I have been struggling for a while to obtain a recipe for a Scottish macaroni pie, without much luck.  Bearing in mind that I have never tasted one, the following may be a close approximation.

I made two portions of hot water crust pastry, hand moulded it into 8  '''not''' 12 pie cases, blind baked these for 20 minutes at 180\u00b0 C (350\u00b0 F - Gas 4), made half a portion of basic macaroni cheese and used it to fill the pie cases.  Sprinkled a little extra cheese on the top and baked these for 15 minutes at 180\u00b0 C (350\u00b0 F - Gas 4).

I have to say that I found the hot water crust pastry unbelievably greasy and not very nice at all.  I will repeat the experiment using shortcrust pastry, which may not be authentic but will probably be nicer.
===Visitor's tip for making hot-water crust pastry===
You want to make the pie crust with as cold water as possible. The dough should also be worked together as quickly as possible, not to generate to much heat.

Leave to rest in the fridge for 30 min before rolling it out.  --Siri-Ann
