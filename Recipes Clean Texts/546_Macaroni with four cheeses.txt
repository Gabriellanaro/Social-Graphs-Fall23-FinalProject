===Description===

Macaroni cheese (Mac and cheese), simple yet tasty - especially when made with four cheeses, though there is nothing to stop you replacing these just one cheese.

===Ingredients===
| 250 g (9 oz) dried macaroni
| 40 g (1½ oz) butter
| 40 g (1½ oz) plain flour
| 600 ml /(1pint) milk
| 110 g (4 oz) grated Gruy\u00e8re cheese
| 110 g (4 oz) grated Emmental cheese
| 1 teaspoon of chili flakes (optional)
| 50 g (2oz) grated Cheddar cheese
| 50 g (2oz) grated Parmesan cheese
| Freshly ground black pepper
===Method===


| Cook the macaroni in a large saucepan of boiling salted water for 8-10 minutes; drain well and set to one side.
| Melt the butter over a medium heat in a pan slightly and add the flour, stir to form a roux, cooking for a few minutes.
| Whisk in the milk, a little at a time. Cook for 10-15 minutes until you have a thick, smooth sauce.
| Meanwhile, preheat the grill.
| Remove the sauce from the heat and add the Gruy\u00e8re and Emmental and stir well until the cheese has melted and combined into the sauce.
| Season with black pepper.
| Sprinkle the chili flakes into the cheese sauce, if using, and mix well.
| Tip the macaroni into the sauce and mix well. Pour the mixture into a deep ovenproof dish.
| Sprinkle the Parmesan and Cheddar over the top and place under the grill until the cheese has melted and some of the macaroni has crisped up a little.
===Serving suggestions===
Serve immediately.
