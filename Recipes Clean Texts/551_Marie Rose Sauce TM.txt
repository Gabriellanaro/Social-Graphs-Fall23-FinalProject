I don't usually make this with oranges, but it made a nice change.

===Description===

This is a translation of a recipe in '''Salsas y Ali\u00f1os con Thermomix (Susaeta Ediciones)'''

===Ingredients===TM
| 2 very fresh egg yolks
| 1 orange
| 100g tomato ketchup
| 1 teaspoon brandy
| 450g olive oil
| 1 teaspoon mustard
| A dash of Tabasco
| Salt
===Method===


| Squeeze the juice from the orange and pour it into the TM with all the other ingredients except for the oil.
| Mix '''4 seconds / Speed 5'''.
| Keeping the motor running at '''Speed 5''' and with the MC in position, pour the oil onto the lid allowing it to fall, little by little, into the TM, until the sauce has emulsified.
| Check the texture, and if it is not thick enough, add a little more oil.
| You can add a little more ketchup if it is too pale.
===Serving suggestions===
This is one of those sauces derived from mayonnaise.  It is perfect with fish, seafood, salads and white meat.  
===Variations===
A variation is made with milk, where you substitute the egg yolks for 200g milk and reduce the oil by half.
