===Description===

This is for making mashed potatoes in a Thermomix is based on a recipe in '''Fast and Easy Cooking''', the Thermomix UK recipe book.

===Ingredients===TM
| 500g boiled hot water, weighed in TM bowl
| 1kg potatoes, peeled and cut into 2cm cubes
| 40g butter or olive oil (if vegan)
| Salt, pepper and grated nutmeg, to taste
===Method===


| Place the potatoes in the internal '''Steaming Basket''' and cook over the water in the bowl for '''18 minutes / Temp. Varoma / Speed Spoon'''.
| Check the potatoes for done-ness and if needed, cook for a few minutes more until fully cooked.
| Drain the potatoes.
| Empty the bowl of water and insert the '''Butterfly Whisk'''.
| Add the butter or oil and seasonings.
| Mix for '''4 - 10 seconds / Speed 4''', depending on desired consistency.
===Chef's notes===
You can use the potato water for stock or for bread making.

Timings will vary according to quantity and type of potato used.  I would personally recommend King Edward.  The mashed potato illustrated was mixed for 10 seconds and looks very gluey, so if you want something rather less pur\u00e9ed I should start with 4 seconds and keep checking until it has achieved your preferred consistency.
