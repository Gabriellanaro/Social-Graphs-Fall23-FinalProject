What a brilliant idea, I have never thought of that!
 

The Judge 

Floury potatoes such as Desir\u00e9e, King Edward or Maris Piper mash very well.  Instead of a potato masher, you can use a potato ricer to make really smooth mashed potatoes.  We also have a recipe for making mashed potatoes in a Thermomix

===Ingredients===
| 900 g) (2 lb) Desir\u00e9e or King Edward potatoes
| 2 oz (50 g) butter
| 4 tablespoons milk
| 2 level tablespoons cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche
| Salt and freshly milled black pepper
===Method===


| Peel the potatoes and cut into 5cm (2\") square pieces
| Place the potatoes in boiling water and boil until soft (about 25 minutes)
| When the potatoes are cooked, remove and drain
| Add the cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, butter and milk
| Using a potato masher, mash to the desired consistency
| Season with salt and pepper
===Serving suggestions===

Serve hot, sprinkled with chopped chives
===Variations===
* Make them with 50/50 carrots
* Make then with 50/50 butternut squash
* Freeze the special mixes above in portion sized freezer bags so you have special mash, easily to hand
