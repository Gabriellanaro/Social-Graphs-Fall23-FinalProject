===Method===


| Slit the chicken breasts down the middle so that they fold out and look relatively symmetrical but do not cut them in half
| Carefully put the chicken in a plastic freezer bag and bang them out with a meat mallet.
| Take the chicken out of the bag and cover them with 2 slices of bacon per breast
| Sprinkle finely chopped spring onions and mushrooms over the meats, but not too thickly.
| Season with a little salt and pepper.
| Fold the chicken back up like a sandwich and use cocktail sticks to keep them together. Just poke them through tightly.
| Wrap in cling-film and let them settle for half an hour in the fridge.
| Put in the oven for 25 mins at 180 C/350 F/Gas 6 on bottom shelf of oven.
| Take out the cocktail sticks and enjoy.
===Serving suggestions===
Serve with salad
