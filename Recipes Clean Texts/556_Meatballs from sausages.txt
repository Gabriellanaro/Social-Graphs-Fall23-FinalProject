I did even better than you: 40 meatballs from 6 sausages.

 

 The Judge 
===Description===

We bought some lovely Italian-style sausages from Gourmet sausage maker - Bexley (Hall Place Farmers' Market, Bexley, Kent), but this time, instead of using them as sausages we would extract the sausagemeat from the sausages and make meatballs.

We'll use half of them to make a pizza each and the remainder can be frozen to be used later in a nice tomato sauce with some spaghetti.

I've added fresh basil as it will works very well with the Italian sausages.  Use whatever fresh or dried herbs you feel would suit your particular sausages.
===Ingredients===

| 6 meaty Italian-style sausages
| Pinch of freshly ground black pepper
| 4 tablespoons olive oil
| 1 small white onion, very finely chopped
| Bunch of fresh basil leaves, finely chopped
| 2 tablespoons of yellow cornmeal

===Method===


| With a sharp knife, carefully cut the sausages lengthwise and scoop the sausagemeat from the skins, which you can discard.
| Peel and very finely chop the white onion.
| Finely chop the fresh basil.
| Mix the chopped onion, herbs and sausagemeat together in a bowl and scrunch it together in your hands, squeezing it  through your fingers to mix really well.
| Using a teaspoon as a rough measure, roll the mixture into quite small balls - I managed 35 small meatballs from 6 sausages!
| Toss the meatballs in yellow cornmeal.
| Add a pinch of black pepper to the olive oil and gently fry for about 5 minutes, turning once.

===Serving suggestions===
Ideal for adding to pizzas or to serve in a tomato sauce with pasta.
===Chef's notes===
I'm deliberately using more olive oil than I really needed to fry the sausages in because I want any remaining oil from the frying to drizzle over the pizza before baking it.
