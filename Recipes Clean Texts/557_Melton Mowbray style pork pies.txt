Such fabulous pies from such an unassuming place.  I stayed there years ago, it's the kind of place where nothing ever happens - however, they invented a great pie!

===Description===

This recipe makes about 6 single portion Melton Mowbray style pork pies using hot water crust pastry and best quality ingredients.

Raised pies are easier to make whilst the pastry is warm.

'''Hot water pastry'''
===Ingredients===
| 225 g (8 oz) strong plain flour
| Pinch of crushed sea salt
| 25 ml (1 fl oz) milk
| 25 ml (1 fl oz) water
| 75 g (3 oz) lard or shortening
| 1 large egg yolk, whisked, for glazing and sealing
'''Pork pie filling'''
===Ingredients===NB
| 350 g (12 oz) pork shoulder, including a little fat
| 110 g (4 oz) unsmoked back bacon rashers, rind removed
| 1.5 teaspoons chopped fresh sage
| ½ teaspoon anchovy essence or 1 teaspoon finely chopped anchovies
| ¼ teaspoon ground allspice
| ¼ teaspoon ground mace
| Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper 


===Mise en place===
* Preheat the oven to 180\u00b0 C (350\u00b0 F - Gas 4)
===Method===

'''Prepare the filling'''

| Add all of the ingredients to a food processor and chop to a coarse mix using the pulse button a few times.  Don't over do it or you will end up with meat paste
'''Hot water crust pastry''' 

| Sift the salt and flour into a bowl
| Mix the water and milk into a small pan gently heat
| Cut the lard into small pieces and drop into the milk/water mix
| Once the lard has completely melted, raise the heat and bring to the boil and then immediately remove from the heat
| Pour into the flour and using a wooden spoon, mix well
| Dust a chopping board with a little extra flour and knead the dough for a minute or two
| Use 2/3rds of the dough for the pies and 1/3 for the lids
| Divide 2/3rd into 6 and roll into balls, using your hands, mould each ball into a pie shape
| Divide the filling into six portions and fill the pies
| Using a pastry brush, paint a little of the egg yolk around the rim of each pie
| Divide the remaining 1/3rd into six pieces, roll into balls and then roll each ball flat to make the pie lids
| Crimp the lids to the pies with the tines of a fork and glaze the pies with any remaining egg yolk
| Make a little steam slash in the top of each pie and bake on a tray for about 50 to 55 minutes
| Allow to cool on a wire rack
===Serving suggestions===

Serve warm or cold

===Chef's notes===

Having made these, I would suggest that this quantity is better suited to 4 slightly larger pies.  Although unconventional, to prevent them collapsing, I would bake them in muffin trays.

===Authenticity===

Please note: True Melton Mowbray Pork Pies do not and never have contained cured pork (''bacon'').
