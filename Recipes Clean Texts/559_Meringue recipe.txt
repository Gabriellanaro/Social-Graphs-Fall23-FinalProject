===Description===


The trick to making successful meringues seems to be turning the oven heat down, immediately they go into the oven and then killing the heat after an hour and not touching them until the oven is completely cold.  It's something I learned from following Delia Smith and it has served me in good stead ever since.

===Ingredients===
| 175 g (6 oz) golden caster sugar
| 3 egg whites from 3 large free range eggs
| 2 tablespoons of unrefined icing sugar
| 570 ml (1 pint) double cream


===Mise en place===
* Preheat the oven to 150\u00b0 C (300\u00b0 F - gas 2)

===Method===


| This recipe is easier to create using an electric hand-whisk or food processor and the meringues may be best made the day before
| Measure the caster sugar and place on a plate
| Place the egg whites in a clean bowl and whisk until the peaks are firm
| Add the golden caster sugar a tablespoon at a time, not adding more until the previous tablespoon has been combined into the egg whites
| Line a baking tray with grease-proof paper and using a tablespoon as a measure, dollop the mixture in rows on to the baking tray
| Put the tray on a middle shelf and immediately turn the heat down to 140\u00b0 C (275\u00b0 F -  gas 1)
| Leave them in the oven to bake for 1 hour
| After one hour, turn the heat off, but leave them in the oven until it is completely cold
