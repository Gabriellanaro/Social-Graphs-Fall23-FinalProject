===Description===

Minced beef in a vaguely Scottish way with mashed potato and vegetable accompaniment.
[[Image:Mince and tatties ingredients.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The basic ingredients]]
===Ingredients===
| 250g fresh lean beef mince.
| 300g potato.
| 150g tinned sweetcorn in water.
| 150g lentils.
| 120g mushrooms.
| 150g leeks.
| 2 onions.
| knob of butter.
| salt.
| pepper.
| splash olive oil.


===Mise en place===
* Finely chop the onions.
* Slice mushrooms.
===Method===


|Boil potatoes in unsalted water 15 minutes.
|Steam leeks above potatoes.
|Boil lentils in separate saucepan - small lentils only take about 10 minutes.
|Heat the olive oil in a large saucepan.
|Add onion and stir until beginning to caramelise.
|Add the mince and stir the mince until all the pinkness has changed to brown.
|Add the mushrooms, sweetcorn and boiled lentils.
|Season to taste.
|Stir well until the mixture is good and hot.
|Season and mash the potatoes with butter, milk and seasoning.
===Serving suggestions===
Serve directly onto warmed plates.
===Variations===
Peas substitute for sweetcorn.

Butter substitute for olive oil.

Proven\u00e7al herb coarse salt if required.

Turnip or swede or carrots for the leeks.
===Chef's notes===
It is deliberate that the mince is added to the saucepan before the mushrooms because I have found that by adding the fungi too early they tend to disappear in the mixture and deprive the tongue of that texture.

Some cooks add water to the cooking mince but in my opinion that makes it too moist.

Any mashed potato not eaten at the time may be held over and fried crisp & brown with bacon and egg for the next day's breakfast!

Note minimum salt used in all my recipes and never in boiling/steaming vegetables.

Not an expert chef, merely a survival cook developing simple foods to my taste.

''Alastair has not specify where the leeks are used, but as there were already lots of onions in the mince, I though they would go rather well in the mash - which they did.  Especially when leftovers were re-fried as a sort of bubble-and-squeak.''

''I would also recommend a big dollop of brown sauce to complete this meal, though I don't know how Scottish that is!'' --Chef 18:22, 27 September 2011 (BST)
