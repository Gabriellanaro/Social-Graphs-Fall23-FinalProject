===Description===

This is a slight variation in that it uses puff pastry instead of shortcrust which I think makes them slightly lighter.

It's also cockney rhyming slang and tasty dessert - can you think of any others?

===Ingredients===
| 1 Packet pre-rolled puff pastry
| 450 g (1 lb) jar of mincemeat
| 55 g (2 oz) caster sugar
| 1 whole egg
| 60 ml (2 fl oz) milk


===Mise en place===
* Preheat the oven to 200\u00b0 C (400\u00b0 F - Gas 6 - Moderately hot)

===Method===


| Beat the egg and add a tiny pinch of salt
| Using a pastry cutter, stamp out 24 x 7.5 cm (3\") circles of puff pastry for the bases
| Push the circles into 2 molded baking trays
| Fill each base with 2 teaspoons of mincemeat and brush the edges with a little milk
| Using a pastry cutter, stamp out 24 x 6 cm (2.5\") circles of pastry for the lids
| Put the lids on the bases and ensure they are sealed
| Brush the egg mixture over the tops of the pies and sprinkle with a little caster sugar
| Bake for 20 minutes and allow to cool on a raised grid to prevent them sweating
===Serving suggestions===

Serve hot with custard
