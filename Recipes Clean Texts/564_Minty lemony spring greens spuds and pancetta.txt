===Description===

With a barbecue, or perch a poached egg on top and call it supper.

===Ingredients===

| 500g new potatoes, cut into 3-4cm chunks
| 140g spring greens, spinach or chard, after stems removed, sliced into thin ribbons*
| Olive oil
| 70g pancetta or smoky bacon, snipped into little squares
| \u00bd onion (red, if you have one), finely sliced
| 2 garlic cloves, roughly chopped
| Lots of freshly ground pepper
| 1 lemon
| A dash of cider or red wine vinegar
| A handful of fresh mint, finely chopped, plus a bit to garnish

===Method===


| In salted water, with a splash of oil, boil your small pieces of potatoes till tender. Test by piercing though the centre of one with a small knife.
| Fold your greens through the boiling water and cook, with the spuds, for a min. Drain. Let them rest for a min to steam off any remaining moisture. Dust with a pinch of salt and pepper. Splash a bit of olive oil over to gloss.
| Fry the pancetta till crisp and golden. Remove from the pan. Add the onion, garlic and a splash of olive oil, if needed. Sizzle till softened.
| Dress the veg with lemon juice and zest. Add the onion and garlic. Toss with the chopped mint. Taste. Add a drop of vinegar, to give it a bit more oomph. Scatter over the pancetta. Finish with the fresh mint. Devour.
===Variations===
If you don't have spring greens to hand, you can swap them out for florets of pan fried or roasted cauliflower, or use fresh rocket or watercress.
