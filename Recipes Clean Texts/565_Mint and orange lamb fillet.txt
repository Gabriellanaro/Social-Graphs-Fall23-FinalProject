[[Image:Mint and orange lamb steaks the ingerdients.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The basic, and very simple ingredients]]
Mint and lamb go really well together, as does orange and lamb, so I thought I would try them both together in the same recipe.
===Ingredients===

| 3 tablespoons of the olive oil
| Freshly ground black pepper
| 1 x 300g lamb fillet, cut in half lengthwise
| 1 medium sized red onion, peeled and chopped
| 100g bottled red pepper drained and roughly chopped.
| 50g black olives, pitted
| 1 orange, zested and peeled then chopped into bite-sized segments
| A splash of lemon juice
| A handful of mint leaves, chopped
| sea salt

===Method===


| Add a good pinch of black pepper to a wok or large frying pan, add 3 tablespoons of olive oil
| Add the chopped red onion and the lamb steaks and brown the lamb fillets, turning often.
| Once the steaks are browned the onions should have also taken some of the colour
| Turn the pan down and add the chopped red peppers and olives
| Add the chopped orange segments and orange zest, together with a splash of lemon juice
| Stir well and simmer gently for about 5 minutes
| Stir in the chopped mint and simmer for a further 5 minutes
| Taste for seasoning and serve
===Serving suggestions===
Serve with roast potatoes and minted peas
