===Description===

This is more of a story than a recipe...

I was talking to my Mum about the historic recipes section and she mentioned this.

\u201cAfter the war, when I worked at Unilever House as a secretary, sometimes, as a treat, Mum used to make me banana sandwiches.  

We had no bananas after the war, so they were made with sliced parsnips flavoured with banana essence!\u201d

I found the recipe below in [http://www.amazon.com/Well-Eat-Again-Marguerite-Patten/dp/0600325245 ''We'll Eat Again'': Marguerite Patten]

===Ingredients===
| 3 Parsnips
| Banana essence or extract
| Sugar to taste

===Method===

| Choose young parsnips if possible for they are more tender and have a sweeter taste. Peel the parsnips, do not slice. 
| Either cook in a small amount of unsalted water until tender or put into a steamer, cover and cook over boiling water.
| If boiling the parsnips, then dry well on kitchen paper. If steaming the parsnips, simply remove from the steamer and dry.
| Slice the cooked parsnips and put into a bowl and mash, add a few drops only of banana essence or extract. The easiest way to obtain a small amount of essence or extract is to dip a skewer into the bottle and then hold this over the bowl so the drops fall.
| Continue adding banana flavouring until you get the right taste. Add sugar to taste then mash until smooth.

Use as a sandwich filling or as a pudding with yogurt or custard.
