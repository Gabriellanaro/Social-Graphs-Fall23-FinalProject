===Ingredients===

| 8 oz of rolled oats [225g - cups]
| 1 teaspoon Marmite (or Vegemite if you are Antipodean)
| 1 free range egg
| 2 fl oz [60 ml - Â¼ cup] of warm water

* Preheat your oven to 160\u00b0 C (325\u00b0 F - gas 3), [fan oven 140\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]

===Method===


| Stir the Marmite into the warm water
| Beat the egg
| Pop everything into a large bowl and mix really well until all the oats are evenly covered
| Leave for 15 minutes so the oats absorb all of the liquid - the consistency should be like a hard dough
| Give the mixture a final knead and add a little more water if it is too stiff
| Roll out to your desired thickness and cut into shapes with a knife or press out using a dog biscuit cutter
| Bake for about 25 to 30 minutes at 160\u00b0 C (325\u00b0 F - gas 3), [fan oven 140\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]
| Cool on a wire rack
