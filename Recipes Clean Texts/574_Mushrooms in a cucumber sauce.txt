===Description===

The first thing to say about this recipe is that it tastes much better than it looks!  It's also a great recipe for using up cucumbers if you grow them at home, as we do.  

This went really nicely with mashed potatoes and barbecued pork chops that had been treated to a London broil marinade.

===Ingredients===

| A good grind of black pepper
| 50g [2 oz] butter
| 110 g [4 oz] of oyster mushrooms, wiped clean and chopped
| 1 tablespoon [15 ml] plain flour
| Half a cucumber, de-seeded, peeled and cubed
| 150 ml [1/4 pint] hot vegetable stock
| 1 teaspoon dried dill
| sea salt to taste
| Freshly chopped parsley to garnish

===Method===


| Add a good grind of black pepper to a small saucepan
| Melt half of the butter
| Saute the mushrooms in the butter for 4 minutes, turning often
| Remove with a slotted spoon and keep warm
| Melt the remaining butter
| Cook the cucumber cubes until they visibly 'wilt', about 5 minutes, stirring now and then
| Make a roux by sprinkling  the flour over the buttery cucumber and mix well so all the fat is absorbed
| Add the dried dill and hot stock and blend into a sauce
| Bring to the boil and then reduce and simmer for 10 minutes
| Stir in the mushrooms
| Serve
===Serving suggestions===
Serve over barbecued meat or vegetables.
