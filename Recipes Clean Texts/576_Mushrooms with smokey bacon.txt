A great combination and another use for your home smoked bacon.

===Ingredients===
| 400g (14 oz) button mushrooms
| 4 tablespoons olive oil
| Â½ teaspoon ground mace or grated nutmeg
| Freshly ground black pepper
| 4 rashers of home smoked bacon, chopped into strips
| 3 cloves of Garlic
| 1 glass of good red wine
| 3 tablespoons chopped parsley
===Method===


| Brush the mushrooms clean, don't wash mushrooms.
| Heat the olive oil in a heavy pan and fry the mushrooms until they have taken a little colour and start to sweat.
| Season with pepper and mace or nutmeg
| Add the bacon and garlic and fry for 3 minutes, stirring often
| Deglaze the pan with the wine, reduce the heat and simmer for 5 minutes - the aim is to reduce the wine to just a little sauce
| Stir in the parsley, remove from the heat and serve immediately
