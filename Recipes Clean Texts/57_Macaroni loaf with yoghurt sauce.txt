===Description===


I first spotted this recipe many years ago and judging by the photograph it looked revolting.  Having now read the recipe and thought about it, realise could be very delicious.  This will keep for up to two days.

| 70g stale breadcrumbs
| 130g cashew nuts, ground
| 130g Brazil nuts, ground
| 80g Parmesan cheese, grated
| 125g strong Cheddar cheese, grated
| 2 tablespoons sultanas
| 1 teaspoon chilli powder
| ½ teaspoon turmeric
| ¼ teaspoon ground cumin
| 1 red pepper, finely chopped

'''Yoghurt sauce'''
