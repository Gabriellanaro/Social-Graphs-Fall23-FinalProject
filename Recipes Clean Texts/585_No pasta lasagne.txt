Originally I thought what's the point of this, until I tried to keep the carbohydrates down!

===Description===

Having a low-carb day, or just fancy a change from pasta? Then courgettes to your rescue for you my friend. This fresh, organic Mediterranean style recipe is yummy and healthy. Hurrah.

===Ingredients===

| 1 jar of tomato pasta sauce, or make your own, ''see Chef's notes''
| 2-3 courgettes
| sea salt and freshly ground pepper
| A lemon
| 100g parmesan
| A few handfuls of fresh basil
| 2 balls of fresh mozzarella
| A handful of pine nuts (optional)
| olive oil
===Mise en place===

* Heat your oven to 180\u00b0 C (350\u00b0 F - gas 4), [fan oven 160\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]

===Method===


| Dollop a few spoonfuls of sauce in the bottom of a lasagne dish. Top with overlapping ribbons of courgette (use your veg peeler).
| Sprinkle with salt, pepper, lemon juice and zest. Scatter with grated parmesan and basil and torn mozzarella. Repeat. Repeat again, but skip the courgettes.
| Top with pine nuts. Season. Bake in a 180\u00b0C/Gas 4 oven until golden, 20-30 mins.
===Chef's notes===
Make your own tomato sauce: Fry finely diced onion in olive oil till tender. Add two or three chopped garlic cloves. Season. Sizzle for a mo. Add a tin of tomatoes, bubble it for a few mins. Add a glug of balsamic vinegar. Bubble again. Fold in fresh herbs
