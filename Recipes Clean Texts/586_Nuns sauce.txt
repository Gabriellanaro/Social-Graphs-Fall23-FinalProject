===Description===

The very old form of relish for beef was made by nuns in a Yorkshire convent in 1870. Most of the large farms in the north made their own relish to eat with beef

===Ingredients===
| Â¾ oz of cayenne pepper
| 2 tablespoons of soy sauce
| 3 cloves of garlic
| A tablespoons of anchovies (these came in barrels and the scraping of the barrel was used)
| A few cloves
| 3 or 4 shallots
| 1 teaspoon of sugar
| A quart of vinegar
===Method===


| Pound all dry things with the dry sugar
| Chop and add the onions, etc.
| Put into a leadless glazed demijohn  with the vinegar, and cork lightly.
| This jar was then left at the foot of the stairs for a month, and everyone passing up and down to chapel (twice a day) had to give it a shake.
