Was not hot enough the first time

So it was more like caramel toffee, which was even nicer, just rather messy to eat.

===Description===

Watching a Rick Stein TV program, he made a panna cotta with green pistachio nut brittle dessert.  I have lots of lovely nuts from RealFoodSource bought from Amazon recently so I thought I would make something similar. I'm only interested in the nut brittle and I'm going to use Brazil nuts, Cashew nuts and almonds.  I've blitzed ¾ of the nuts and left the remaining nuts whole.

Go easy when consuming this as it contains a massive amount of sugar!

See '''Chef's notes''' below for ''improvements'' I've made to Rick's recipe.
===Ingredients===

| 2 tablespoons of butter
| ½ a cup of granulated sugar
| ½ a cup of muscovado sugar
| 100 ml water
| 1 teaspoon sea salt
| 1 cup of mixed nuts of your choice - some broken, some whole.

===Method===


| Line a baking tray with greaseproof paper - check that it will fit in the fridge! 
| Add the butter, sugar and water to a heavy based pan and heat over a medium flame
| Carefully stir until everything has combined
| Boil for about 10 minutes until it reaches 'hard-crack' stage
| Threads should be formed as you pull a spoon away and the threads should break easily when cooled
| If you have a jam thermometer your looking for about 146\u00b0-155 \u00b0 C (295\u00b0-310\u00b0 F).
| Do not let the sugar burn or it will be brittle
| Stir in the nuts, mix well and quickly pour the mixture onto the greaseproof paper and spread out with a spatula.
| Refrigerate for around 30 minutes, then break up the brittle into bite-sized pieces.

===Chef's notes===
After finding that this was far too sweet for me, and rather too soft, I made some improvements:
* I tipped everything into a big saucepan.
* Added a further 2 cups of mixed nuts.
* Heated for 10 minutes, stirring all the time.
* Even after this, the nuts actually tasted soft, not what I wanted.
* I put the oven on a very low grill [120\u00b0] and tipped the sticky nut mixture onto an unlined oven tray.
* Grill/baked the nut mixture for about 15 minutes.
* Allow to cool completely
* Smash the toffee mixture into smaller pieces and store in a Lock and Lock box
* '''They are now perfect''' (for my taste)
