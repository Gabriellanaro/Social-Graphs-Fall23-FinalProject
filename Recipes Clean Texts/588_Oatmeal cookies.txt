I don't normally like cookies, but these were all right

Buttery, crunchy on the outside, soft in the middle and a wonderful accompaniment for homemade ice-cream.  These are quick and simple to make.

===Ingredients===
| 225 g (8 oz) butter, softened
| 225 g (8 oz) sugar
| 2 egg yolks
| 1 teaspoon vanilla essence
| 110 g (4oz) oats
| 225 g (8oz) plain flour
| 1 teaspoon bicarbonate of soda
| Â½ teaspoon salt


===Mise en place===
* Preheat the oven to 160\u00b0 C (325\u00b0 F - gas 3)
===Method===


| Line a baking tray with grease-proof paper
| If you want to be a purist, whisk the egg yolks and vanilla together, beat the butter and sugar then fold in the dry ingredients and mix until you have a 'dough' that stands-up on its own.
| Or, being a lazy sod like me, sling it all in a food processor and blitz it.
| Roll the cookies into balls and place on the baking tray with enough room for them to spread out.
| Bake for 14 minutes
| Remove and cool on a rack
===Serving suggestions===
Serve with coconut ice cream
