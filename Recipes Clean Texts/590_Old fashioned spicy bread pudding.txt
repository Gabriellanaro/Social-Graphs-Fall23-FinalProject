Not to be confused with bread and butter pudding, this spicy version was often frugal way to use up stale bread. Now it's a good excuse to let bread go stale on purpose.

I prefer this made with brown bread, the way my mum used to make it.

===Ingredients===
| 225 g (8 oz) brown bread or white bread with the crusts cut off
| 2 teaspoons of mixed spice
| 50 g (2 oz) chopped candied peel
| 110 g (4 oz) sultanas
| 25 g (1 oz) currants
| 25 g (1 oz) raisins
| 3 tablespoons of brandy, whisky or other spirit of your choosing
| 275 ml (10 fl oz) full fat milk
| 50 g (2 oz) of melted butter
| A little olive oil for greasing
| 1 large beaten egg
| 75 g (3 oz) muscovado sugar
| Grated zest of 1 lemon
| Grated zest of ½ an orange
| 1 tablespoon demerara sugar
| Freshly grated nutmeg


===Mise en place===
* Preheat the oven to 180\u00b0 C (350\u00b0 F - gas 4)
* Place the dried fruit and your chosen spirit in a bowl and leave for an hour to infuse the flavours.
* Break the bread into 1cm (1/2\") pieces a add to a large bowl and leave for 30 minutes to soak.
===Method===


| In a separate bowl, mix the beaten egg, muscovado sugar, melted butter and mixed spice and beat well to combine.
| Pour this into the milk and bread mixture.
| Beat this mixture really well with a fork so there are no lumps.
| Fold the marinaded fruits, spirit and fruit zest into this mixture.
| Spoon this mixture into a baking dish and spread it out evenly.
| Sprinkle the top with a little freshly grated nutmeg and the demerara sugar.
| Bake in the middle of the oven for 1 hour, 15 minutes.
===Serving suggestions===
Serve with hot custard, consume and then find a comfy chair to sleep it off in.
===Variations===
Try other dried fruits, apricots, cherries etc.

My Dad loved this, I think it reminded him of good times during the war.
