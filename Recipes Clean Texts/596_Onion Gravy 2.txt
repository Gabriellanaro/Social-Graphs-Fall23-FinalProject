A nice easy onion gravy recipe - great with a sunday roast.
===Ingredients===
| 285ml (Â½ pint) Vegetable Stock or Water
| 1 Large Onion
| 1 tablespoon Oil
| 1 tablespoon Heaped Flour
| 1 bay leaf
| Pinch Dried Sage
| Dark soy sauce or  light soy sauce, either is ok; light soy will be saltier, dark soy, richer
| Salt and Pepper, to taste
===Method===


| Peel and chop the onion.
| Heat the oil in a heavy based saucepan and add the onion, saut\u00e9 gently until golden brown.
| Add the flour and herbs, cook for 3-4 minutes, ensuring that the flour does not burn.
| Gradually add the stock (or water), stirring constantly to prevent lumps.
| Bring to the boil and simmer for 10 minutes.
| Add the soy sauce and then season to taste, not the other way around.
| Remove the bay leaf, serve as is or blend into a smooth sauce.
