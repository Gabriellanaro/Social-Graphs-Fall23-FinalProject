This alone was worth getting the dehydrator for!

===Description===

I have never been able to buy onion powder in the UK and have had to rely on a friend who regularly visits Barbados to bring me some American powder that she can get there.  However you can easily make your own at home.  If you do not have a dehydrator, you can dry them in the oven on its lowest setting in which case they will dry quicker (although their nutritional value will be reduced).

The time given below for dehydrating is approximate as it does depend on the temperature and humidity of your kitchen.

===Ingredients===

| 2 kg of  fresh onions, cut into 4 mm slices.
| Pinch of salt

===Method===


| Add a pinch of salt to the onion slices
| Dehydrate the onions for 7 hours at 60\u00b0C for 2 hours, then 50\u00b0C for the remaining 6 hours.
| Grind the onions using a food processor or Thermomix, until you have a powder of the desired consistency.
| Keep in jar or Lock & Lock box.
===Serving suggestions===
Use in soups and stews or as part of a spice mix or rub.  Also use when cooking sous vide as raw onions can take on a metallic taste.
