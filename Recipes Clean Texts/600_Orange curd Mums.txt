===Description===

Another recipe from Mum's scribbled cookery notes, seeing the recipe now, I'm amazed to see how simple it was for her to make such a great staple.

===Ingredients===

| 2 large free range eggs
| 100g (4 oz) butter
| Grated zest and juice of 2 large oranges
| Grated zest and juice of half a lemon
| 225 g (8 oz) brown sugar


===Method===



| Beat the eggs and add to the top pan of a bain-marie (double-boiler), with the remaining ingredients.  A bowl over a pan of simmering water will do if you don't have a bain-marie
| Stir until the sugar has dissolved.
| Continue gently heating and stirring as the curd thickens.  Its ready when it is thick enough to coat the back of a wooden spoon.
| Pour into hot, sterilised jam jars and seal properly.
