===Description===

A recipe from ''The Cookery Book of Lady Clark of Tillypronie''.  Lady Clark (1851-1897) collected recipes from her hostesses when visiting friends, and then tested them in her own kitchen.  In 1909 her husband arranged for the recipes to be published in book form.  This is a custard based fool.
===Ingredients===

| 570ml double cream
| 3 egg yolks
| The juice of 6 oranges
| caster sugar, to taste - I used 4 tbsps for a mixed citrus fool, but I would halve it if just using orange juice
| The grated zest of 1 orange (use a Seville orange if in season)

===Method===


| Beat the eggs into the cream
| Add the orange juice and the zest
| Add the sugar and gently cook in a double boiler, or a bowl over a saucepan of water
| Once the mixture has thickened, remove from the heat and pour into dishes or glasses
| Leave to cool before serving
===Serving suggestions===
Serve with Orange and almond shortbread
===Variations===
Use other citrus fruit if you like, or a mixture
