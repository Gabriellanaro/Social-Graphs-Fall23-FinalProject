As suggested, I tried with 300 ml of lemon juice from Morrisons and it worked perfectly.

===Description===


This is a simple recipe for home made vegan jelly produced from orange (or any other) juice and agar-agar.

===Ingredients===

| 360ml orange juice
| 4g agar-agar

===Method===


| Mix the orange juice and agar-agar in a small saucepan and bring to the boil.
| Boil for 2 minutes, stirring from time to time to dissolve the agar-agar.
| Remove from the heat and leave for 5 minutes.
| Pour into a lined rectangular baking tray and leave to set in the fridge for 10 minutes.
| Using a palette knife, remove the jelly from the tray and cut into rectangles.
===Serving suggestions===
Use the rectangles as a base for sweet and savoury canap\u00e9s.
===Chef's notes===
If you want to make a deeper jelly, it will need longer than 10 minutes to set.
===Variations===
Try this recipe with a variety of different fruit juices.
