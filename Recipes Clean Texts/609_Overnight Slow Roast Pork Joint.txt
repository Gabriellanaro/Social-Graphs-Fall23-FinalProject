===Description===


The idea for this recipe came from Jamie Oliver's \"Cook With Jamie - ''My Guide to Making You a Better Cook''\" [https://www.amazon.co.uk/Cook-Jamie-Guide-Making-Better/dp/0141019700 ISBN 0-718-14771-5 Amazon].  His recipe is fine but the quantities are far too large as that would serve 12 people!  I've reduced the quantities so the recipe should serve about 6 people and the ingredients are more easily available and affordable.

The original recipe used a bulb of fennel which was not available from any of our local suppliers, so as we try to only source local products, I picked some apples from our neighbour's tree and used those instead \ud83d\ude09. 
===Ingredients===

| 1 tablespoon whole fennel seeds
| ½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
| 2 teaspoons of pink sea salt
| 3 apples, cored and roughly cut up, no need to peel
| 2 large carrots, peeled and sliced
| 2 large onions, peeled and sliced
| 1 whole bulb of garlic, separated into cloves which are then peeled and  crushed under a knife
| Bunch of fresh thyme leaves
| 10 fresh sage leaves
| 2.2 kg boneless pork shoulder, rolled and tied
| 4 tablespoons olive oil
| half a bottle of white wine
| ½ pint of chicken stock
===Mise en place===

* Pre heat your oven to the highest setting - remember this is only for the first 15 minutes roasting.

===Method===


| Grind the fennel seeds and salt together in a spice mill or coffee grinder and set to one side.
| Add a good glug of olive oil to the base of a large roasting tray and layer all of the onions, garlic, herbs, spices and sliced vegetables in the tray.
| Carefully cut slashes in the pork skin using a Stanley knife.  Massage the skin with a tablespoon or so of olive oil and then rub the fennel-salt into the cuts.
| Sit the pork on top of the vegetables and pop into your oven set to its highest setting for just 15 minutes.  Don't forget to time this, you'll destroy a great pork joint if you don't turn it down in time!
| After 15 minutes, cover the joint with tin-foil, pour the half of the bottle of wine over the vegetables, reduce the heat to 120\u00b0 C (250\u00b0 F - gas \u00bd) and cook for 4 hours
| After 4 hours, slice the skin and most of the fat from the joint and discard
| Cut the pork joint in half, lengthwise, turn over and cover with the vegetables to keep the meat moist, re-cover with tin-foil and slow-cook for a futher 4 hours at 120\u00b0 C

===Serving suggestions===
We served this in multiple ways; first portions with roast potatoes, vegetables and gravy, second portion, after a little spicing up, as pulled pork in taco shells with sour cream and salad, and the final portions as Pulled Pork Enchiladas.
