The smell of this reminds me of winter afternoons for some reason.

A traditional British winter soup, sadly more commonly seen in tins nowadays than made in the home.

===Ingredients===
| 600 g ox-tail, cut into 8 pieces (your butcher should do this for you)
| 2 red onions, finely diced
| 3 carrots, scraped and finely diced
| 1 leek, finely diced
| 3 celery stick, finely diced
| 1 medium, or 2 small turnips, finely diced
| Garlic, to taste, fined diced (I used 3 bulbs)
| 4 tomatoes
| 1 teaspoon dried thyme
| 2 large bay leaves
| 275ml Guinness
| 1.75 litres beef stock
| Seasoning
| Parsley, chopped (to garnish)
===Method===


| In a deep stock pot, fry the oxtail pieces on all sides until browned and a lot of the fat has melted - do not add additional fat if possible. You may need to do this in 2 batches.
| Remove from the pan and reserve, leaving 1 tablespoon fat in the pan.
| Add the onions, carrots, leek, celery, turnips and garlic and fry until the onion is soft.
| Add the tomatoes and herbs cook for a further 5 minutes.
| Return the ox-tail to the pan with the Guinness and stock.
| Bring to the boil, reduce the heat and simmer (covered) for about 1Â½ hours, stirring occasionally, until the meat is cooked.
| Remove the ox-tail from the pan and reserve.
| Remove the bay leaves and pur\u00e9e the soup or rub through a sieve.
| Pick what meat there is from the ox-tail and add it to the pan.
| Reheat and adjust seasoning.
| Serve, sprinkled with the chopped parsley.
===Serving suggestions===
Serve with croutons or country bread.
===Variations===
If good, ripe, fresh tomatoes are availables, these can replace the tinned tomatoes, but peel them first.
===Chef's notes===
You will need a large stock pot for this - about 6 or 7 litre capacity.  Ox-tail is quire fatty, so if you can, leave the soup overnight in the fridge and skim the fat off the next day.
