===Description===

A nice traditional homemade sausage that is quite highly flavoured and has the advantage for the home chef that it does not need a skin.  I've made mine from minced beef rather than veal.

This recipe makes 18 sausages which will easily serve six people.

From Wikipedia: \"Oxford sausages are a distinctive variety of pork and veal sausage commonly associated with, and thought to have been developed in, the English city of Oxford. Traditionally, Oxford sausages are noted for the addition of veal, in contrast to many traditional British sausages which contain only pork, and their high level of spice seasoning. References to the \"Oxford\" style of sausage date back to at least the early 18th century, but it was more widely popularised owing to inclusion in Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management, first published in 1861\"
===Ingredients===

| 450g lean boneless pork shoulder, minced
| 450g minced beef (or veal)
| 350g shredded suet
| 225g breadcrumbs
| Grated rind of ½ a lemon
| ½ teaspoon grated nutmeg
| 1 tablespoon of chopped fresh mixed herbs or 1 teaspoon dried mixed herbs
| 1 teaspoon freshly chopped sage leaves
| Pinch of salt and pepper
| 1 egg, beaten
| Cornmeal for coating

===Method===


| Mince the pork and beef (or veal) - a food processor with a metal blade makes short work of this!
| Add everything but the beaten egg and the cornmeal to a large bowl and mix well with your hands
| Add the beaten egg and mix everything together
| Shape the mixture into sausages or burgers
| Coat lightly with cornmeal
| Grill or fry until evenly browned

===Serving suggestions===
I'm going to use some of these in our lovely curry sauce with rice and broccoli
===Variations===
Because these are skinless sausages they can easily be made into burgers.
===Chef's notes===
These cook well in an air fryer - 180\u00b0 C for anout 15 minutes, resting for 5 minutes after cooking
