==Ox head==

This recipe for cooking an ox head comes from the marvelous book: :Cookbook: Food In England

I only add it for a bit of fun because I can't image that you would be able to obtain a complete ox head very easily.

Our local Sainsbury's doesn't stock them.

===Ingredients===
| 1 ox head
| A few peppercorns
| A bunch of fresh herbs
===Method===

|Get this prepared by the butcher, who will send it to you split in two.
| Lay it in strong salty water overnight and rinse under a briskly running tap til thoroughly clear. The tongue should be salted separately.
|Put the head into a pan with water to cover, a few peppercorns, salt ,a bunch of herbs , and vegetable trimmings.
| Simmer till the bones and meat all fall to pieces, then drain into a basin.
| Take out every scrap of bone and gristle and chop the meat  finely, sprinkling with powdered herbs and pepper.
| Press into a mould set with a weight on top, and turn out when cold.
| Garnish with parsley and serve with pickles and roast potatoes.
| The broth, strained and boiled with oatmeal, onions, or a strongly flavoured vegetable such as celery, makes a meaty soup.

''Note'':  Be sure you put the  remnants, bones, vegetables, etc., out for the fowls to pick clean.  There is enough miscellaneous picking on an ox-head to keep an industrious hen busy for hours
