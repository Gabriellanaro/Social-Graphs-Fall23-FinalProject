===Description===

This recipe is shamelessly purloined from my ProBreeze air fryer and slightly modified to suit my taste.

The ProBreeze Air Fryer is a non-paddle air-frier - basically a hot basket, so this recipe would be fine in a fan oven too.
===Ingredients===

| 2 x 120 g salmon fillets
| 2 teaspoons of olive oil
| Â½ lemon
| 1 tablespoon smoked paprika
| Pink sea salt
| Freshly ground black pepper
===Mise en place===

* Preheat you air fryer to 180\u00b0 C
* If using a conventional oven, use the temperatures below and allow 15 minutes for a conventional oven to reach temperature
* 200\u00b0 C (400\u00b0 F - gas 6), [fan oven 180\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]

===Method===

| Using a microplane grater, remove and reserve the zest from half the lemon
| Cut the remaining half of the lemon into very thin slices
| Spray the salmon pieces with a little olive oil
| Add the smoked paprika, lemon zest, salt and pepper to another plate
| Press the salmon pieces into the spice mix to cover all sides
| Add the salmon pieces to the basket and cook for eight minutes
