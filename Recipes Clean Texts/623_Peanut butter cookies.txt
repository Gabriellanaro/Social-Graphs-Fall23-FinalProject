===Description===

I first saw this in a Saturday Times recipe section; I'm a lover of peanut butter, but not a fan of sweets so I have modified this to match my personal taste.

''The original recipe used 200g of granulated sugar and no salt or other spices.''
===Ingredients===

| 250g peanut butter, depending if you want bit in the cookies, or not.
| 75g demerara sugar
| 1 large egg
===Mise en place===

* Preheat your oven to 180\u00b0 C

===Method===


| Add the peanut butter, sugar and the egg to your mixer, fitted with a metal blade
| Blend until it's a smooth paste
| Scoop up a large tablespoon of the mixture and roll in to a ball
| Place on a non-stick baking sheet and flatten with the back of a fork ensuring they are well spaced apart
| These quantities make 16 cookies
| Bake for 10 to 12 minutes until they look crispy
| Leave on a cooling rack until completely cooled

===Recipe source===
* Based on a recipe seen in the Saturday Times; 16th April 2022
===Variations===
I made half of the mixture as the recipe, the remaining half I mixed with a heaped tablespoon of Sambal Udang Bercili Ranggup - Crispy Prawn Chilli; the chilli version is superb and what I would make in future!
