Counteracts the saltiness of cured pork - very moorish!

===Pease pudding nursery rhyme===

:Pease pudding hot,
:Pease pudding cold,
:Pease pudding in the pot, nine days old.
:Some like it hot,
:Some like it cold,
:Some like it in the pot,
:Nine days old.

This historic recipe if great with gammon, ham or boiled bacon - it's even good spread on bread.

You need to plan ahead for this recipe as the split peas need to soak for 24 hours

===Ingredients===
| 475 g (1 lb) split peas
| 1 onion, quartered
| Bouquet garni
| 50 g (2 oz) butter
| 1 large egg
| Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
| White wine vinegar (unconventional and very optional)
===Method===


| Soak the split peas in fresh water for 24 hours
| Rinse and drain
| Add the presoaked split peas to a large pan of boiling water containing the onion, bouquet garni, salt and pepper and return to the boil
| Simmer for 2 ½ hours, checking and adding water if required. Take it from me, it's easy to boil this one dry - and it stinks when you do!
| Drain the cooked split peas
| Blend in a food processor or press through a sieve or a potato ricer
| Beat in the egg and butter and season well
| I use a glug of white wine vinegar to thin this down if needed, but I have strange tastes
===Serving suggestions===

Cut into sensibly proportioned cubes, wrap tightly in tin foil and freeze

When required, defrost naturally and microwave for 3 minutes or so.
===Variations===
Geordie hummus joke aside, yesterday I turned our pease pudding into hummus - fantastic it was too.  I crushed  4 cloves of garlic and sauteed them in 4 tablespoons of olive oil until they just started to colour and then stirred the mixture into the pease pudding.
