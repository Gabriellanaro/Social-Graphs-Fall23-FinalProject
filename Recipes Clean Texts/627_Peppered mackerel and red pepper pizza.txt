A strange combination but it worked very well.  The kind of pizza you would probably find in Sicily.

===Description===

About time we had another seafood pizza.  This time I thought I would try [https://groceries.morrisons.com/webshop/product/Morrisons-Fishmonger-Peppered-Smoked-Scottish-Mackerel-Fillets/209931011?from=search&tags=%7C105651&param=mackerel&parentContainer=SEARCHmackerel_SHELFVIEW smoked peppered mackerel].  It's available from most supermarkets, a 250g pack usually contains 4 peppered mackerel fillets, plenty enough for 2 pizzas.  I used 2 jarred red peppers in oil to add a little colour and flavour.

===Ingredients===

| 1 portion of Pizza dough (makes 2 pizzas)
| About 6 tablespoon of Tomato sauce for pizza or passata
| 1 260g pack of smoked peppered mackerel
| 2 large red peppers in olive oil, sliced lengthwise
| 2 balls mozzarella cheese torn into small pieces(about 250g in total)
| Chili oil to taste
| sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
===Mise en place===

* Preheat the grill to high - with a pizza stone if you have one

===Method===


| Divide the pizza dough into two and roll out into two pizzas
| Make each pizza individually and place the first one in the oven to keep warm whilst the second pizza completes
| Grill the pizza for about 2 to 3 minutes per side with no toppings added
| Removed the part-baked pizza and spread with Tomato sauce for pizza or passata
| Remove the skin from the mackerel fillets and tear into bite-sized pieces and distribute over the pizza
| Do the same with the red pepper strips
| Arrange the torn mozzarella over the seafood. Try to cover as much of the seafood as possible so it does not get too crisped
| Season with salt and black pepper and drizzle with chili oil if liked
| Bake for about 3 or 4 minutes under the hot grill until the mozzarella just starts to brown
| Serve immediately
