===Description===

These are great with roast dinners, especially roast beef and can also be made as a puddings and served with golden syrup,  black treacle, jam, lemon juice and sugar, etc...

The original recipe on this page was a variation of Delia Smith's Yorkshire pudding recipe from her Illustrated Cookbook.  However, over the years we have had a few failures and I would heartily now recommend this recipe instead.  

This recipe is far simpler and has never failed for me.  I believe this recipe originates from Brian Turner, the famous Yorkshire chef.

===Ingredients===
| Vegetable oil
| ½ cup of whole milk (125 ml or 125 g or 4.6 oz) - ''Skimmed or semi-skimmed milk does not work as well''.
| 3 tablespoons of water
| ½ cup of plain flour (75g or 2.6 oz)
| ½ cup of eggs (2 large eggs or 3 small eggs)
| A pinch of salt


===Mise en place===
* Preheat the oven to 220\u00b0 C (425\u00b0 F - Gas 7)

===Method===


| Select your measure and use it to measure out equal quantities of whole milk, plain flour and eggs - 1 cup takes about 5 medium eggs.
| Tip the flour, eggs, milk and water into a bowl and add a generous pinch of salt.
| Whisk by hand until all of the lumps are beaten out of the flour and no more.  Don't over-beat the batter - it is not necessary.
| Leave the mixture to rest '''at room temperature'' for 30 minutes''' if you have the time.
| Generously grease a metal baking tray (about 28 cm x 18 cm - 11\" x 7\") with the vegetable oil -  brushing works well here.
| Place the tray in the middle of the oven until and leave until the oil is hot and almost smoking
| Pour the batter mixture into the very hot tray
| Bake for 20 minutes in the middle of the oven.

===Chef's notes===

This recipe always rises well and creates perfectly formed puddings, but they do tend to be rather 'puddingy' (almost sponge-like), probably because of the amount of eggs in comparison with Delia Smith's Yorkshire pudding recipe.
