You can make these delicious fruity scones from scratch in 35 minutes.  Just mind you don't eat them all at once!



===Ingredients===

| 50g butter or margarine
| 250g self raising flour
| 1 teaspoon baking powder
| 1 medium cooking apple, peeled, cored & grated
| 25g caster sugar
| 50g Philadelphia Extra Light
| 5 tablespoons skimmed milk
| 100g Philadelphia Extra Light
| 2.5 tablespoons fruit jam (e.g. blackcurrant)


===Mise en place===

* 220\u00b0 C (425\u00b0 F - gas 7), [fan oven 200\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]
===Method===



| Rub the fat into the flour until it resembles breadcrumbs. Add remaining dry ingredients and mix well.
| Mix 1 tablespoon of the milk with the Philly to form a runny paste and stir into the mixture.
| Add enough of the remaining milk to form a stiff dough (saving some to brush the top of the scones).
| On a floured table and roll out the dough to 2cm thick.
| Cut into scones with a round cutter and place on a greased baking sheet.
| Brush the tops with a little milk and bake at 220\u00ba C, Gas Mark 7 for 10 - 15 minutes or until golden.
| Cool on a wire rack and fill with the Philly and jam.
