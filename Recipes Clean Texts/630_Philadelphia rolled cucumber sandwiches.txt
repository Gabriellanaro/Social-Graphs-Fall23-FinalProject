===Description===

More tea vicar, or perhaps another cucumber sandwich?

Now you can cover up your faux-pas by offering a cup of tea and a creamy rolled version instead.



===Ingredients===

| 2 slices wholemeal bread
| 30 g Philadelphia Extra Light
| 40 g piece cucumber, peeled
===Method===



| Cut the crusts off the bread and flatten slightly with a rolling pin.
| Spread with Philadelphia and top with very thin slices of cucumber, leaving 1cm at the end of the bread which is Philadelphia only ,to aid rolling up.
| Roll up from the cucumber end so that the Philadelphia at the other end sticks the sandwich together.
| Serve immediately.
