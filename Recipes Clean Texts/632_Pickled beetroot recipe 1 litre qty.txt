===Description===

I have adapted the original Mrs Beeton's original pickled beetroot recipe for a less industrial quantity than hers.  This recipe also uses ''off the (supermarket) shelf ingredients''.  You don't even need a Kilner jar, the jar that contains the Sarson's pickling vinegar can be sterilised by a hot wash in the dishwasher and used to store the pickled beetroot.  You'll even have some spare spicy vinegar left over for your fish and chips.

===Ingredients===
| 1 x 500 g bunch of beetroots (about 5 to 7 medium sized beetroots
| 1 x 1.14 litre jar of Sarson's clear white pickling vinegar
|* The vinegar purports to be already ''spiced'', but I like to add a little zip to my pickles, hence the pickling spices..
| 1 x 26g packet of Schwartz `Pickling Spice' '''pictured''


===Mise en place===
* Wash the beetroot free of any dirt but do not scrub hard and be careful not to nick the skins (or they will leach colour).
* Trim the leaves, leaving a few mm of the stem and remove the tap-root without cutting the skin of the beetroot.
===Method===


| Bring a large pan of water to a boil, add the beetroot and simmer  for 90 minutes.
| Drain the beetroot and set aside to cool. 
| Once cool enough to handle, rub the skins off and properly trim the stems and roots.
| Cut into slices about 12mm thick.
| Sterilise the Pickling vinegar jar (or a  1 litre Kilner jar - A hot wash in the dishwasher should suffice for home use.
| Pack the slices into the jar.
| Meanwhile, add the all of the vinegar and all of the the spices to a large pan, and in a well-ventilated room, bring to a boil and continue to boil for 10 minutes.
| Remove from the heat and allow to cool completely.
| You can strain the spices through a clean cloth or leave them in.  I enjoy my pickles quite spicy so tend to leave them in.
| Pour the vinegar over the beetroot, ensuring that it is totally covered.
| Seal the jars securely and set aside in a cool, dark, cupboard and allow to mature for a few weeks before use.
| Strain any remaining vinegar through a clean cloth and bottle to use as a spicy condiment.
