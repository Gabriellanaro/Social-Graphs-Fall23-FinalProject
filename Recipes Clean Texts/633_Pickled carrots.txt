Not sure why you would need to pickle carrots nowadays.  I think they are one vegetable that is better fresh.

===Description===

Nice and easy to make and no need to make huge quantities.  

Not really sure how long this would last though I would guess 3 months providing the jar is properly sterilised

===Ingredients===
| 8 carrots, peeled and julienned
| White wine vinegar and water mixed 50/50 to cover
| 1 tablespoon white sugar
| 1 teaspoon sea salt
| 1 tablespoon whole coriander seeds
| 1 teaspoon dried dill
| 1 teaspoon chilli flakes
| Grind of black pepper
===Method===


| Add the vinegar and water mixture, white sugar, salt, pepper to a suitable pan. Bring the mixture to a boil. Remove from heat and allow to cool slightly.
| Place the carrots in a sterile jar
| Cover with the vinegar solution
| Seal the containers, refrigerate and marinate for at least a week to allow the flavours to permeate.
===Variations===

Try a different mix of vinegars - I always think if the vinegar blend tastes nice, then so will the pickles.

Add your favourite spices to the pickles.
