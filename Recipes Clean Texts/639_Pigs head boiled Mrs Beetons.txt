[[Image:BeetonsAd.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Other publications - circa 1945]]
This is from Mrs Beeton's Cookery Book.  This copy was a gift, dated 1950

I tried in vain but could not find a use for the left over hair, eyes, snout and brains!

===Ingredients===
| 1 Pig's head
| 1 lb common salt
| 1 oz saltpeter
| Pease pudding
===Method===


| Scald and cleanse the head thoroughly, removing the hair, eyes, snout and brains
| Soak in strong salt and water for about 24 hours, changing the water 2 or 3 times, then drain and dry well
| Mix the salt and saltpeter together, run it well into every part of the head, repeat this process daily for 5 to 6 days
| Drain the head from brine, place in a stew pan containing sufficient warm water to cover it, bring to the boil and skim well
| Simmer gently for 3 Â½ hours
===Serving suggestions===

Serve with pease pudding
===Warning===

Please research the risks of using saltpeter if you ever attempt this recipe!
