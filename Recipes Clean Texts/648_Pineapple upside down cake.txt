This colourful cake-come-pudding can be easily made from items found in a well kept kitchen cupboard.

'''topping'''
===Ingredients===
| 30 g butter, softened
| 30 g muscovado sugar or  demerara sugar 
| 2 tablespoons of apricot jam. Any jam or marmalade would be fine
| 220 g whole pineapple rings in juice
| 8 Glac\u00e9 cherries
'''cake mix'''
===Ingredients===NB
| 100 g butter, softened
| 100 g caster sugar
| 3 free range eggs
| 100 g self-raising flour
| 1 teaspoon baking powder
| 2 tablespoons milk


===Mise en place===
* Preheat the oven to 180\u00b0 C (350\u00b0 F - gas 4)
===Method===

'''topping'''

| Beat the softened butter, sugar and jam and spread in the base of a non-stick cake tin
| Arrange the pineapple rings in the base with a cherry in each pineapple ring and others dotted about as you wish
'''cake mix'''

| In a large bowl, mix the butter and caster sugar
| Beat in the eggs, one at a time, each with a 1 tablespoon of flour
| Sift the remaining flour into the bowl together with the baking powder
| Add the milk and mix really well
| Spoon the mixture over the pineapple rings and smooth over with a spatula
| Bake for 40 to 45 minutes until well risen and golden brown. To check if it is properly cooked, insert a skewer into the middle of the cake - it should come out clean if the cake is properly cooked
| Leave in the tin to cool  for 5 minutes then loosen the edges with a spatula
| Place a large serving plate over the baking tray, turn everything over and tap the tray to release the cake.
