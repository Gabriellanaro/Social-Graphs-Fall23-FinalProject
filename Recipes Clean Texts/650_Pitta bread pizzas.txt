A nice easy recipe that is great to get kids to help with.

===Ingredients===
| 4 wholemeal pitta breads or 8 mini pitta breads
| 4 teaspoons tomato pur\u00e9e
| 4 slices ham, shredded
| 2 tablespoons cooked sweetcorn
| 100g Dragon mild Welsh Cheddar cheese, grated
| 2 tomatoes thinly sliced
| Sprinkling of dried basil
===Mise en place===

* Preheat your oven to 200\u00b0 C (400\u00b0 F - gas 6), [fan oven 180\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]

===Method===


| Spread each pitta with 1 teaspoon pur\u00e9e. Arrange tomato slices, ham and sweetcorn on each pitta and sprinkle with cheddar and basil (try with other toppings such as salami, peppers, pineapple or make a funny face with your ingredients for kids).
| Place on the baking sheet and bake for 10 minutes until the pittas are golden brown and bubbling.
