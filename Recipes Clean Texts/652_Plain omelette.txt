One of the easiest meals to make and this is simplicity itself.

===Description===

As omelettes are so quick to make, it's just as easy to make one each as it is to make one huge omelette.

===Ingredients===
| 2 large free-range eggs
| Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
| Splash of cream or milk (optional)
| 1 tablespoon butter or olive oil
===Method===


| Break the eggs into a bowl with the salt, pepper and milk
| Mix roughly with a knife. Don't whisk - it's nice to get some white and yolk only areas in the omelette
| Add the butter to a small frying pan
| When the butter is foaming add the mixture to the pan
| Fry for 2 minutes on this side, pulling the solid edges to the centre with a fork
| Flip over and fry for 1 minute on the other side
| Slide on to a warm serving plate, folding the omelette - this way, the last bit of cooking is done on the plate
===Serving suggestions===

Serve immediately

Add some tomatoes at the side and a leaf of coriander or mint so it looks different and tastier.

Also you can put a drop of mayonnaise on the top of the tomatoes and an olive.

===Variations===

Experiment using chopped herbs such as chives or parsley.

Rub the pan with half a garlic clove prior to frying (discard the garlic).

Add a handful of microwaved mixed vegetables just before folding over.
