But it looks brilliant - like a fabulous harvest festival centrepiece.

===Description===

This plaited loaf is made with 6 braids, rather than the more usual 3 and needs to be started the evening before.
[[Image:Plaited bread - the crumb.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Plaited bread - the crumb]]

===Ingredients===
| 330ml milk
| 550g strong white bread flour
| 7g fast action yeast
| 50g olive oil
| ¾ teaspoon salt
| 1 large egg, beaten
| Oil for greasing
| 1 egg, beaten, for brushing


===Mise en place===
* The evening before, mix all of the milk, half (275g) of the flour and the yeast.
* Cover with clingfilm or a shower cap and leave overnight in the fridge.
===Method===


| The following morning, remove the bowl from the fridge and allow to come up to room temperature.
| Mix in the other 250g flour and the remaining ingredients.
| Knead, according to your chosen method.
| Shape into a ball and place in an oiled bowl and leave, covered until almost double its size.
| Deflate the dough and repeat the previous step.
| Divide into 6 - use your scales - trying not to deflate the dough too much..
| Roll each piece into 'sausages' about 20 cm in length. 
| Hold them upright in front of you and attach the ends to each other. 
| Take the first right-hand braid and pass over the following two (2-3) under 4 and over the last two (5-6).
| At this stage, the first part finds itself at the end beyond braid 6 and braid 2 is found at the extreme right.
| You continue as before, so take what is now braid 1, pass it over 2 and 3, under 4, and over 5 and 6.
| Repeat these actions until the plait is complete and then seal the end.
| Cover and allow to proove.
| Brush with the egg and bake in a preheated oven at 180\u00b0 C (350\u00b0 F - gas 4), [fan oven 160\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour], for 50 minutes.
| You may wish to turn the bread round after 30 minutes, if your oven is like mine and cooks unevenly and I would recommend that you turn it upside down for the final 10 minutes of the cooking time.
| When baked, allow to cool on a wire rack.
===Recipe source===
* This is my own recipe, but the plaiting method is explained at '''[http://djouza.over-blog.com/article-pain-aux-oeufs-86664280.html Ma Cabane aux D\u00e9lices]'''.
===Variations===
Add flavourings to taste, such as onion powder, tomato pur\u00e9e, seeds, grated cheese etc.
===Chef's notes===
The plaiting was not that difficult, but you need to keep the braids quite tight.  When dividing your dough, use a metal dough cutter as this will give a cleaner cut.
