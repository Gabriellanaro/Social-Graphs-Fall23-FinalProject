===Description===

Following the success of the Chicago deep pan pizza, I have made many versions of the deep-dish pizza.  This recipe is inspired by the Ploughmans' lunch: ham, cheese, Branston pickle, tomatoes and variations thereof.  Following a true ploughmans', obviously Cheddar would be the cheese of choice, however, I spotted some lovely oak barrel aged feta so used that instead.

These deep-dish pizzas are excellent cooked the moment the dough has been made, but if time and conditions allow, they are even better if left in a warm place to rise first.  They then become light and airy with a sponge-like texture.  As this is a rare warm sunny day, I'm going to leave this one out to rise for a few hours before it's cooked.

===How to ensure a crispy base===
Having made these deep pan pizzas many, many times, I've found that sometimes it's hard to get the base well cooked without burning the rest of the pizza dough.  I've found the best way is to use a meta-based pan, similar to a baking tray.  The metal base gets hot enough to crisp the base properly.  I have a really heavy rectangular Le Creuset baking tray that is absolutely ideal.  It seems a shame as it will mean I'll never use my earthenware deep pan pizza dish again!

===Ingredients===
| 180 g good quality sliced ham.
| 1 portion of pizza dough
| fine yellow cornmeal for dusting
| 150 g (5 oz) Feta cheese, crumbled or sliced
| 50 g (2 oz) freshly grated Parmesan cheese
| 1 400 g can of chopped peeled tomatoes, left to drain over a coarse sieve for 15 minutes or more.
| Â½ teaspoon of dried oregano
| Freshly ground black pepper
| 4 tablespoons Branston pickle


===Mise en place===
* Preheat the oven to 190\u00b0 C (375\u00b0 F - gas 5), [fan oven 170\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]
* Make the dough as instructed

===Method===



| Spray or lightly oil a deep 25cm (10\") pizza dish or pan
| Roll out two thirds of the dough to about 3mm and line a pan so the dough just  overlaps the edges and trim any excess
| Sprinkle the base with two thirds of the Feta cheese
| Layer the ham over the cheese.
| Spread the Branston in a thick layer, over the ham.
| Sprinkle with one third of the Parmesan cheese
| Roll out the remaining dough to make a lid
| Pinch the lid so it joins the base and make a few slashed in the top for steam to escape
| Mix another third of the Parmesan cheese with the oregano and black pepper and mix into the tomatoes
| Spread the tomato mixture over the top of the dough
| Top with remaining crumbled feta cheese and the rest of the Parmesan cheese
| Bake for 45 minutes, resting a sheet of tin-foil on top of the pizza for the final 10 minutes
| Allow to cool for 5 minutes before slicing and serving
===Serving suggestions===
Serve with a green salad

===Chef's notes===
A fantastic pizaa.   The oak barrel aged feta made a really nice change for a pizza.  Will have to use it again.
