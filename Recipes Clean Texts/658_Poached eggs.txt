The Judge 

While you can make poached eggs using a purpose made egg poacher, it is just as easy to cook them using a normal saucepan or frying pan.  The trick is to swirl the water vigorously first and then gently lower the egg into the centre of the pan using a ladle or a saucer.

===Ingredients===
| 1 Really fresh egg, free-range if possible.
| A pinch of sea salt
===Method===


| ''Don't attempt more than 2 eggs at a time in the same pan''
| Fill a small frying pan about 4 cm (1.5\") with boiling water and lower heat to a simmer.
| Add a pinch of sea salt
| Break each egg into its own saucer
| Slide each egg off the saucer into the water. Do both in a short space of time if you can
| Wait 3 minutes...
| Remove each egg with a slotted spoon
| Allow each egg to drain properly, as soggy toast is horrible

===Chef's notes===
Don't let the water boil, it will break up the egg white.
Don't stir the water again.
Skim the white residue if you wish.
===Serving suggestions===
* Serve with hot brown buttered toast, using only real butter.
* Pat dry and refrigerate for later use in a salad.
