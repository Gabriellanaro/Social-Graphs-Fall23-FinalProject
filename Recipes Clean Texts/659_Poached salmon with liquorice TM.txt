===Method===


'''For the liquorice jelly'''

| Strain through a fine sieve and reserve
| Add the 50g cold tap water to the bowl and sprinkle the agar-agar over the top 3-4 minutes (until temperature is reached) / Speed 1 / 100\u00b0 C
| Once it has got to 100\u00b0 C, wait until it has cooled to 90\u00b0 C, then 3 minutes / Speed 1 / 90\u00b0 C, by which time the agar-agar should have dissolve
| Pour in the liquorice stock 3 minutes / Speed 1 / 90\u00b0 C
| Blend 20 seconds / Speed 8 and remove bowl from the stand
| Line a small baking tray with cling-film and pour the mixture into it

'''For the vanilla mayonnaise'''

| Put all the ingredients in the bowl, except the oil, and mix 10 seconds / Speed 4.
| With the MC on the lid, program Speed 4 and pour the oil onto the lid, little by little.
| If the mayonnaise curdles, take it out of the bowl and without washing it add 50g hot water and at Speed 5, incorporate the curdled mixture, little by little.
'''For the salmon'''

| Add 1 litre water to the bowl
| Place the salmon in a dish in the bottom varoma basket and add enough olive oil just to cover the fish 20 minutes / 100\u00b0 C / Speed 3
'''To serve'''

| Mix the asparagus with the grapefruit and dress with a little oil from the salmon
| Cut pieces of the liquorice jelly to fit the tops of the salmon pieces.
| Plate the salmon with a piece of the liquorice jelly on top
| Put 3 coriander seeds on top of the liquorice
| Using a pipette, dot the plate with the reduced balsamic vinegar
| Add spoonfuls of the asparagus mixture and serve with the vanilla mayonnaise
