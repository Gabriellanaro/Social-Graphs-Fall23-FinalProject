The oddest thing, but really good.

[[Image:Morrisons mixed bean salad.jpg|300px|thumb|right|Morrisons' mixed bean salad]]

Well these beans are not baked, they're popped, like popcorn but they taste better than any tinned baked beans and only take 10 minutes from start to finish.

I got the idea of frying the beans from one of Jamie Oliver's 15 minute meal TV programs but instead of making a salad I wanted to make luxury baked beans.

This is a brilliant recipe to mess about with and is ideal for using up odd leftovers.

===Ingredients===

| 1 400g can of mixed bean salad
| 1 whole bottled red pepper, chopped and 2 tablespoons of the oil from the jar
| Freshly ground black pepper
| 1 tablespoon sundried tomato paste
| 1 tablespoon tomato puree
| Pinch of sea salt

===Method===


| Drain the beans and rinse them a few times and allow them to drain well
| Heat the red pepper oil in a large frying pan over a high heat
| Add a pinch of black pepper to the oil and swill it around the pan
| Get a cover for the pan as it will spit violently when you add the beans
| Very carefully tip the beans into the frying pan and cover quickly
| Jiggle the pan to keep the beans turning over, ideally while holding the cover an inch away from the pan so they don't start to steam yet
| After a minute or so, the beans will pop like popcorn, crisping the skins and revealing a fluffy core
| Once most of the beans have popped and the pan has calmed down a little, stir in the  chopped peppers, sundried tomato paste and tomato puree
| Mix well, reduce the heat and cover and simmer for 3 or 4 minutes
| If they look too dry, add a splash of liquid.  You could use water, stock , wine or beer.  I used a splash of Stella lager to loosen them
| Serve immediately
===Variations===
Use any variety of canned beans and practically anything you can think of.  Bottled peppers are good because they don't require any cooking, however you could add fresh peppers for a little crunch, finely chopped spring onions, chillies, oh the list is endless!
