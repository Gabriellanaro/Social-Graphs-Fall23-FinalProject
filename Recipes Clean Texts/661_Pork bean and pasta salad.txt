===Description===

This healthy salad recipe is a great use for leftover roast pork.

I've used dried shiitake mushrooms as they are a great kitchen stand-by but fresh mushrooms of any type will do

===Ingredients===

| 150 g dried pasta of your choice, I used macaroni
| 200g cooked roast pork, cubed
| 1 cup of dried shiitake mushrooms
| 1 eating apple, peeled, cored and chopped
| A few spring onions, chopped
| 1 tin of mixed beans, thoroughly rinsed and drained
'''dressing'''
===Ingredients===NB
| 2 tablespoons cider vinegar
| 2 tablespoons of olive oil
| A dash of balsamic vinegar
| ½ teaspoon sugar
| A pinch of salt
===Mise en place===

* If using dried mushrooms, soak in boiling water for 30 minutes, drain well then slice thinly

===Method===


| Cook the pasta in salted boiling water as instructed on the packet. We have a comprehensive list of pasta cooking times here
| Drain well
| Mix all of the ingredients together in a serving bowl
| Whisk up the dressing ingredients and season to taste
| Mix the dressing into the salad
| Chill and serve
