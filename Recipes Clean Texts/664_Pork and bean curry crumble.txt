 The Judge 
===Description===

This is just an aide-memior for me so I can replicate this recipe easily.

It's 'constructed' from pre-made ingredients so the preparation times are a little inaccurate.
===Ingredients===

| 1 portion of my curry sauce for 2 people, about 500 grams
| 2 small pork steaks, chopped - I've cooked them sous-vide for 4 hours at 50\u00b0 C but they could probably go in raw if sliced thinly
| 1 can of mixed beans, rinsed and drained
====crumble====
===Ingredients===NB
| 105 g suet
| 105 g self-raising flour
| 1 teaspoon baking powder
| Pinch of salt and pepper
| 30g cold water
===Mise en place===

* Preheat your oven to 200\u00b0 C (400\u00b0 F - gas 6), [fan oven 180\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]

===Method===


| Add the chopped pork to two pie dishes
| Tip most of the mixed beans over the pork.  I didn't use the full tin.  The remains freeze well
| Pour over enough curry sauce to cover and mix well
| Mix the flour, suet, salt, pepper and baking powder
| Rub the flour and suet together until it starts to feel springy
| Tip in the water (30g) and mix into a dough
| Leave to rest for 30 minutes then roll out to roughly cover the pic dishes
| Bake for 30 minutes at 200\u00b0 C
===Serving suggestions===
Serve with green beans and mashed potatoes
