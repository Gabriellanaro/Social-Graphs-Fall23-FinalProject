Used to make this all the time, but now we live in a village with 3 artisan butchers, we have no need anymore!

===Description===

This  sausage meat recipe would be ideal for making your own sausages or burgers or for use in a stuffing recipe or force-meat recipe.

It's fairly simple, and easy to adjust the quantities to suit your recipe.

Although a meat mincer is the best tool for mincing the pork, I find that a food processor with a sharp metal blade used in pulse-mode does the job equally well.  Just go easy or you can quickly turn the meat into paste!

===Ingredients===
| 250g beef stewing steak, diced
| 250g free-range or organic pork shoulder
| 250g free-range or organic pork belly
| 25g fine dried breadcrumbs (optional)
| ½  teaspoon salt
| 16 sage leaves, finely chopped
| Black pepper
| ¼ teaspoons of freshly grated nutmeg
===Method===


| Using a meat mincer or a food processor with a metal blade mince the stewing steak, pork shoulder and pork belly to your desired consistency.
| Add all of the ingredients to a large bowl.
| Using clean hands mix the ingredients really well.
| Use to make sausages, burgers or freeze for later use.
===Chef's notes===
If you are going to make burgers, add a beaten egg at the mixing stage to bind the sausagemeat together.
