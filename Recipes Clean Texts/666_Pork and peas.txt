I would slow cook this next time.  It was lovely but very chewy.  3hours in the slow-cooker would be much better.

A nice wintery casserole dish that's really simple to make to your own personal taste.  Leave out what you don't like and add what you fancy.

===Ingredients===

| 1 kg boneless pork shoulder cut into 1 cm (1/2\" cubes)
| 275g / 10 oz frozen peas
| 15g / ½ oz lard, ghee or olive oil
| A good pinch of freshly ground black pepper
| 1 large onion, peeled and chopped
| 3 cloves of garlic, peeled and crushed
| 1 tablespoon of smoked paprika
| ¼ teaspoon chilli powder
| 125 ml / 4 fl oz chicken stock
| 75 ml cider
| 2 tablespoons freshly chopped parsley

===Method===


| Heat the lard, oil or ghee in a large frying pan and add the black pepper
| Stir-fry the pork cubes for 5 minutes until lightly browned, remove and keep to one side
| Add the onions and garlic and stir-fry for another 5 minutes
| Add the pork back to the pan and shake over the dry spices and toss the pork to coat evenly
| Add the chicken stock and cider, cover and simmer for 40 minutes, or until the pork is cooked
| Add the frozen peas and chopped parsley stir in and cook for the final 10 minutes, no need to defrost them
| Taste for seasoning and serve

===Chef's notes===
The pork shoulder was too tough cooked in this manner, far better to slow cook for two or 3 hours to break up the tough tissues.  Another solution would be to mince the pork shoulder first.
===Variations ===
I made this for two, using half the meat but the other ingredients were left mostly the same; more gravy, pass the peas!
===Serving suggestions===
Serve over egg noodles and vegetables of your choosing
