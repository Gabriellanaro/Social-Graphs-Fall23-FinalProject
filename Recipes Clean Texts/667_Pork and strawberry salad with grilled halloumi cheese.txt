===Description===


The idea for this recipe came from Jamie Oliver's ''Jamie at Home''.  I've often used fruit in  savoury recipes but never with strawberries.  They have a fantastic flavour and just the right amount of tartness to cut a fatty meat such as pork.

As it's August, Morrison's (and probably every other supermarket) has strawberries on special offer - 2 x 400g cartons of British strawberries for \u00a33.00 so what you don't use in this recipe you can enjoy with a dollop of soured cream as a sweet.

''Most of the preparation time is spent in allowing the cooked ingredients to cool''.
===Ingredients===

| 200g fresh strawberries
| 2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar (or balsamic glaze)
| Juice and zest of 1 lime
| 1 small basil plant (supermarket-type)
| 5 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil
| 200g halloumi cheese, sliced to 5mm
| 10 fresh mint leaves, finely chopped
| A small bag of tender salad leaves
| 1 small red onion, peeled and very thinly sliced
| 120g selection of continental meats (eg: Morrisons 'Spanish Platter')
| Salt and freshly ground black pepper

===Method===


| Pick most of the basil leaves and gently fry for 5 minutes in 5 tablespoons of olive oil
| Allow to cool and drain the oil in a sieve and discard the leaves
| Fry the sliced halloumi in a frying pan or griddle tray for 2 minutes a side, moistening the pan with a smear of olive oil
| Remove the cheese allow to cool, then chop into smaller slices
| De-hull the strawberries (my long-nosed plier tip works brilliantly on strawberries that are not over-ripe).  Cut the strawberries into thin slices. 
| When the basil infused oil has cooled, mix it with the juice and zest of 1 lime and a pinch of salt and black pepper
| Add the strawberries and the oil to a bowl and leave them until you are ready to put the dish together.  Drain and reserve the strawberry/basil oil to use a a final dressing.
| With the cold sliced halloumi as a base, build the salad in layers with the salad leaves, mint leaves, sliced onions, Spanish meats and the remaining fresh basil leaves. Finally drizzle with the flavoured olive oil.
| This dish was fantastic, I loved the idea so much that some more strawberries have already been bought to go with Sunday's roast pork!
===Variations===
This would make a brilliant starter and an impressive anti-pasta dish.

Make a spicy version; use Hugh's fried halloumi.
