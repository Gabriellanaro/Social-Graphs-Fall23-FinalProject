===Description===

[[Image:Pork fillet, apple and sweet potato bake out of the oven.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Fresh out of the oven]]
This is a small variation on pork sausage and apple pie. The only difference being that we used a small pork fillet and used half sweet potato and half normal potatoes for the mash. 

===Ingredients===
| Dash of olive oil
| 250g pork fillet [10 oz]
| 1 leek, halved along its length and cut into slices.
| 2 cloves garlic, peeled and crushed.
| 225g mashing potatoes such as Nadine, Saxon, Wilja, Desiree or King Edward, peeled and quartered
| 225g sweet potato, peeled and cut into slices
| 25 g (1 oz) Butter
| 200 ml (.42 pint) dry cider 
| 1 tablespoon plain flour
| ½ teaspoon mustard powder or 1 heaped teaspoon of taco-mix
| 1 large cooking apple, peeled, cored and cut into very thin rings
| Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper


===Mise en place===
* Preheat the oven to  204\u00b0 C\t(400\u00b0 F - Gas 6)

===Method===


| Cut the pork fillet into small slices
| Fry the pork fillet slices in a little olive oil for 5 minutes
| Add the leeks and Fry for another 4 minutes
| Add the crushed garlic and stir fry for a minute of so
| Add the mustard or your choice of spices to the flour and sprinkle over the pork and leeks.
| Stir well to distribute the flour evenly
| Deglaze the pan with the cider
| Season with a pinch of salt and pepper.
| Meanwhile, boil the potatoes and sweet potatoes in lightly salted water until they are soft and can be pierced easily with a fork
| Mash the sweet potatoes and the potatoes together in the same bowl and add the butter and salt and pepper to taste
| Layer half of the apple rings i=onto the base of an oven proof dish
| Pour the pork mixture over the top
| Layer the remaining apple on top of the pork mixture, top with mash potato and decorate with the tines of a fork
| Bake in the oven for 1 hour minutes
===Serving suggestion===

Serve hot with a green vegetable such as broccoli or peas..

===Chef's notes===

If the leeks are large and a little 'tired', freshen them by blanching them in boiling water for 3 minutes-this stops them drying out whilst they are being saut\u00e9ed.
