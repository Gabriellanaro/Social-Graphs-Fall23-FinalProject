===Description===

Not a very adventurous meal, but a damned good one, none the less.

A couple of tricks to turn this from a 'standard meal', to a special occasion

* Use high quality specialist sausages

* Prepare the baked potatoes so the skins are hard and crunchy

* Add lots of chili sauce to your baked beans!
===Ingredients===

| 1 pack of high quality specialist sausages - see chef's notes below
| 1 onion, peeled and roughly chopped
| A hand full of fresh herbs - sage is ideal
| Freshly ground black pepper
| 2 large baking potatoes
| 1 415g can of baked beans
| Chilli sauce
===Mise en place===

* Prepare your jacket potatoes by salting them for 4 hours - instructions are here.  This gives you a rock hard, crunchy skin as you can see from the photo.
* Preheat your oven to 200\u00b0 C (400\u00b0 F - gas 6), [fan oven 180\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]

===Method===


| Bake the potatoes in the middle to the top of the oven for about 1 hour 15 minutes.
| Add a tiny splash of olive oil to a small baking tray
| Arrange the chopped onions in the base of the baking tray
| Spread the herbs out evenly and place the sausages on the herby onions and sprinkle with freshly ground black pepper
| After the potatoes have been cooking for about 45 minutes, pop the sausages in the in the middle of the oven and bake for 30 minutes, turning once.
| Microwave the baked beans for 2 to 3 minutes, stir in your favourite chili sauce and serve.
