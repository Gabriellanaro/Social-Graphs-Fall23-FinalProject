Sheep's pie - gotta be the best ever.

===Description===

This pork sausage and apple `shepherds pie' was created from what happened to be about on the day.  It was a brilliant success and will definitely be made again.

===Ingredients===
| Dash of olive oil
| 4 large pork sausages
| 1 leek, halved along its length and then chopped into slices
| 450 g (1 lb) good mashing potatoes such as Nadine, Saxon, Wilja, Desiree or King Edward, peeled and quartered
| 25 g (1 oz) Butter
| 200 ml (.42 pint) dry cider 
| 1 tablespoon plain flour
| ½ teaspoon mustard powder
| 1 large cooking apple, peeled, cored and cut into thin rings
| Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper


===Mise en place===
* Preheat the oven to  204\u00b0 C\t(400\u00b0 F - Gas 6)

===Method===


| Fry the sausages in a little olive oil for 10 minutes, reserve and keep warm
| Fry the leeks in the same pan until tender
| Deglaze the pan with the cider
| Add the mustard powder to the flour and whisk into the cider and leeks, season with salt and pepper
| Meanwhile, boil the potatoes in lightly salted water until they are soft and can be pierced easily with a fork
| Mash the potatoes and add the butter and salt and pepper to taste
| Pour the Cider and leeks into an oven proof dish
| Lay the sausages on top of the leeks
| Make a layer of apple rings on top of the sausages
| Top with mash potato and decorate with the tines of a fork
| Bake in the oven for 1 hour

===Serving suggestion===

Serve hot with a green vegetable such as broccoli.

===Chef's notes===

If the leeks are large and a little 'tired', freshen them by blanching them in boiling water for 3 minutes-this stops them drying out whilst they are being saut\u00e9d.
