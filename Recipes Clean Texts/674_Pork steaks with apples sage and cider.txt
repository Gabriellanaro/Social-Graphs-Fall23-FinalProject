===Description===

This autumnal recipe is pretty quick to prepare and cook and will be a pork lovers firm favourite and is a good way to use up those excess apples.

===Ingredients===
| 1 tablespoon Olive oil
| 4 boneless pork loin steaks
| 250 g shallots, peeled but not chopped
| 1 medium cooking apple
| 1 medium red-skinned eating apple
| 300 ml good quality cider
| 2 tablespoons of fresh sage leaves, chopped (''about 14 leaves'')
| Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper


===Mise en place===
* Peel, core and cut each apple into 8 slices
* Leave the 
shallots blanching in just boiled water for 3 minutes then  top, tail and peel them.

===Method===

| Heat the oil in a wok or large frying pan and cook the steaks for 5 minutes per side.  They should be lightly browned.
| Add the shallots and stir-fry for another 6 minutes.
| Drain any excess fat.
| Add the apples, sage and cider, stir well and season to taste.
| Simmer vigorously for 25 to 30 minutes or until the apples have broken down into the sauce.
===Serving suggestions===
Serve with mashed potatoes or squash mash and a green vegetable.

We're going to try this with Squash, bubble and squeak.
===Chef's notes===
Although 14 sage leaves sounds an awful lot, it probably could have had more as the flavour was not prevalent.
