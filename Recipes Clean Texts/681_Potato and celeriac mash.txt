Not bad for a change, but I don;t think you can beat good old mashed potato and butter.

===Description===

This unusual recipe comes from Jamie Oliver's new book: \"Jamie's Great Britain\" ISBN 978-0718156817 and goes well with Guinness lamb shanks with dark sticky gravy.

It is ever so simple to make and is probably a good way to introduce kids to odd vegetables - they don't come much stranger than this!

If you like the taste of celery, you'll love this; it's celery flavoured mashed potato.

===Ingredients===
| 1 whole celeriac, about 1 kg
| About 800g potatoes - see method
| A splash of full cream milk or single cream
| 1 tablespoon butter
| Salt and pepper
===Method===


| 'Peel' the celeriac by roughly slicing off the skin - don't try to peel in conventionally.
| Wash the 'peeled' celeriac - ''you will probably get about 800g of celeriac from a 1 kg celeriac''.
| Weigh out an equivalent amount of peeled potatoes, the amount does not have to be accurate - 50/50 ish.
| Cut the potatoes into quarters and the celeriac into slightly smaller chunks into small chunks so they cook  quickly and evenly.
| Add to a large pan of boiling salted water, return to the boil and cook for 20 minutes.
| Drain and  leave in the pan to steam for few minutes.
| Mash with a potato ricer or a potato masher.
| Add a tablespoon of butter, a splash of full cream milk or single cream.
| Season and serve.
