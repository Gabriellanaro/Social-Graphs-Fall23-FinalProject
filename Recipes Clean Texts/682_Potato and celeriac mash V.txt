I'm not a fan of celeriac, but this makes mash quite interesting

===Description===

This unusual recipe comes from Jamie Oliver's new book: \"Jamie's Great Britain\" ISBN 978-0718156817.

It is ever so simple to make and is probably a good way to introduce kids to odd vegetables - they don't come much stranger than this!

===Ingredients===
| 1 whole celeriac, about 1 kg
| About 800g potatoes - see method
| Salt and pepper
===Method===


| 'Peel' the celeriac by roughly slicing off the skin - don't try to peel in conventially.
| Wash the 'peeled' celeriac - ''you will probably get about 800g of celeriac from a 1 kg celeriac''.
| Weigh out an equivalent amount of peeled potatoes, the amount does not have to be accurate - 50/50 ish.
| Cut the potatoes into quarters and the celeriac into slighly smaller chunks into small chunks so they cook  quickly and evenly.
| Add to a large pan of boiling salted water, return to the boil and cook for 20 minutes.
| Drain and  leave in the pan to steam for few minutes.
| Mash with a potato ricer or a potato masher.
| Season and serve.
