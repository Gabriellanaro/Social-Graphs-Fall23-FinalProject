===Description===

Get your hit of omega 3 oils with this fishy starter from The Lubborn Creamery.

===Ingredients===
| 2 x100g Capricorn\u00ae Somerset goats cheese
| 90g flaked smoked mackerel
| 1 ciabatta loaf
| A handful of chopped chives
| ½ teaspoon of horseradish sauce
| ½ lemon
| Freshly ground black pepper
===Method===


| Place the flaked mackerel into a bowl.
| Dice and add the Capricorn\u00ae Somerset goats cheese, season well with pepper.
| Add the chives and horseradish.
| Cut a wedge from the lemon and set aside. Juice and zest the remaining lemon, add to the bowl and mix well. Divide into two ramakins.
| Slice the ciabatta, cutting three small slices for each person, and lightly toast.
===Serving suggestions===
Serve with the potted mackerel and lemon wedge.

===Chef's notes===
Don't be tempted to add salt as processed mackerel can be quite salty already.
