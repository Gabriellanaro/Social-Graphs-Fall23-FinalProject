===Description===

This recipe is surprisingly good.  The mint seems an odd herb to accompany seafood and garlic but it worked really well.

This is a variation of Brown shrimp, peas and pasta that I made when I could not manage to buy brown shrimp in the UK.

Home made pasta is the best to go with this dish. Do try it, you don't even need a pasta machine.  Just roll it our flat and cut into rough strips with a knife.

===Ingredients===
| 2 portions of Home made pasta, rolled flat and cut into rough rustic strips
| '''''or''''' 300g dried tagliatelle
| 300g fresh peeled prawns
| 500 g frozen peas
| 4 cloves of Garlic, peeled and crushed
| 2 tablespoons finely chopped mint leaves
| Juice from 1 lemon
| 3 tablespoons of butter or a mixture of butter and olive oil for the more health conscious. 
| Salt and freshly ground black pepper
===Method===


| Melt half of the butter in a pan, add the garlic and gently saut\u00e9 until soft, don't allow it to burn or colour.
| Add the prawns, half of the lemon juice and season with salt, pepper. Stir well to mix and then remove from the heat.
| Meanwhile cook the peas until tender, either by microwaving or boiling - about 4 minutes
| Cook the tagliatelle in salted boiling water until al dente
| Drain the pasta and add to the prawns, Stir in the remaining lemon juice, butter and peas. Mix well, season and serve.
