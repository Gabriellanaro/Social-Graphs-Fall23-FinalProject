===Recipe source===
* Approach To Cookery, An Elementary Cookery Book For Post Primary Schools by a sub-Committee of The Home Economics Teachers' Group, Melbourne Australia, MacMillan 1965.
* Recipe added by Leigh Lingard, by proxy.
===Variations===
I have recently seen a recipe for Yo-Yos on the internet where Nutella\u00ae was used for the filling.
===Chef's notes===
This recipe is copied from my younger sisters' year 8 Home Economics book from 1965. I remembered my Mother making them for us in the early 1950's, I saw the recipe in her cook book & somehow acquired the book.
