If you follow me you will know what a fan I am of Lobster Bisque - this is crazy-good with the additional crab!

This is another version of the old favourite: Salmon and prawn tagliatelle made into a lasagne and using crab-claw meat instead of salmon.

This was extremely good, the crab flavour came through very well.  It is going on our favourites list!

===Ingredients===
| 130g fresh lasagne  (6 sheets) - the sheets were quite small - 1 single layer of pasta required 2 sheets
| 1 teaspoon olive oil
| Pinch of salt
| 1 400 ml can lobster bisque soup
| 150 ml single cream
| 2 tablespoons of dry sherry
| Splash of Tabasco sauce
| Bunch of fresh chives, chopped finely
| sea salt & freshly ground black pepper
| 145g king prawns, chopped
| 114g fresh crab-claw meat
===Mise en place===

* Preheat the oven to 180\u00b0 C (350\u00b0 F - gas 4), [fan oven 160\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]

===Method===



| Bring a pan of salted water to boil and drop the lasagne sheets in one by one.
| Add a teaspoon of olive oil to prevent them sticking together.
| Bring them back to the boil, remove from the heat, cover and leave for 2 minutes. Drain and rinse with cold water.
| Add the lobster bisque, single cream, sherry, salt and pepper to a bowl and stir well.
| Add a few tablespoons of the soup mixture into the bottom of an oven-proof dish.
| Add 2 sheets of pasta, a little more soup and the chopped prawns. Layer another 2 sheets, more soup and the crab-claw meat.
| Finish with a final layer of lasagne and the remaining soup.
| bake for 30 minutes at the top part of the oven.
