Feeling in a bit of a retro mood, I thought I would go back to the 1960s/70s and recreate one of the periods' most popular first courses, but make a whole salad out of it.

'''For the prawn cocktail:'''
===Ingredients===
| 3 tablespoons mayonnaise
| 2 tablespoons salad cream
| 1 tablespoon tomato pur\u00e9e
| 20 ml Worcestershire sauce
| 2 teaspoons cider vinegar
| A pinch of sweet smoked paprika
| A few drops of Tabasco sauce
| Pinch of celery salt
| 400g net of peeled, cooked prawns, drained and dried with kitchen paper
'''For the salad (Use as much or as little as you like of each ingredient):'''
===Ingredients===NB
| 6 Lettuce leaves, chopped or shredded
| A handful of Watercress
| 1 Red pepper, sliced
| 1/4 Cucumber, sliced
| A few Tomatoes, sliced
| 2 Eggs, hard boiled, and quartered
| A few Whole black olives
===Method===


| Mix all of the ingredients, except for the prawns.
| When thoroughly mixed, stir in the prawns.
| This can be prepared in advance.
| Just before serving, layer a plate with a base of the lettuce, watercress, peppers, cucumber and tomatoes.
| Place the prawn cocktail mixture in the centre of the plate.
| Garnish with the egg quarters and olives.
===Serving suggestions===
Serve with Rustic French bread
===Variations===
Just add your favourite salad ingredients.  Suggestions are raw avocado, cabbage, shredded carrot, radishes etc.  Anything raw and crunchy would work well.
===Chef's notes===
If you wish to use homemade salad cream, I suggest you taste it for sweetness before making the Marie-Rose sauce.  Use commercial salad cream if desired, but again, taste and add more vinegar or sugar to your own taste.
