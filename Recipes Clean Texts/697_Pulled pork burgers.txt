===Description===

Not really a recipe, just an idea for re-use of leftover pulled pork. And a very good one at that!

===Ingredients===

| 450g prepared & cooked pulled pork or enough to make 4 pork patties.
| 3 tablespoons of fine yellow cornmeal
===Mise en place===

* Preheat the oven to 200\u00b0 C (400\u00b0 F - gas 6), [fan oven 180\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]

===Method===


| Using your hands, mould the pulled pork into four patties.
| Roll the patties in yellow cornmeal to completely cover.
| Place on a baking tray, lined with Bake-O-Glide or a similar non-stick liner.
| Bake for 15 minutes at the bottom of the over, turning once.
| We cooked these with oven-chips, adding the burgers after the chips had cooked for 5 minutes of so.
===Serving suggestions===
Serve with chips and baked beans!
===Variations===
You could of course fry these, but oven baking is a healthier option.
