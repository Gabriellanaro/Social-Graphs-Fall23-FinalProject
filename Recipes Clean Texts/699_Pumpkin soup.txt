The vinegar seemed to make the difference in the flavour of this soup.

===Description===

Definitely one for the winter.  Our big pumpkin has been sitting under the kitchen window for months, awaiting pumpkin soup day.  When we checked it's weight it was almost a stone (6 kilos) and the recipe only calls for 675 g of pumpkin flesh!  So we'll be making this again in the week!

===Ingredients===
| 1 tablespoon garlic olive oil (normal olive oil will be fine)
| 2 tablespoons butter
| 1 large onion, roughly sliced
| 675 g (1.5 lb) pumpkin cut into chunks (cook un peeled and scoop out the flesh rather than trying to peel it first) 
| 1 lb potatoes, sliced and peeled
| 600 ml (1 pint vegetable stock (make it with a veggy cube if you have to)
| Â¼ of a nutmeg, grated
| 1 teaspoon fresh tarragon (of 1 teaspoon dried tarragon & a handful of freshly chopped basil leaves)
| 600 ml (1 pint) milk
| 2 teaspoons lemon juice
| 2 teaspoons of sherry vinegar
| sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
===Method===


| Heat the oil and butter and saut\u00e9 the onions for 5 minutes, don't brown
| In a separate pan, boil the squash pieces for 10 minutes, remove and scoop out the flesh
| Add the squash flesh and the sliced potatoes to the onions and seat on a low heat for 10 minutes, stirring to prevent them sticking
| If you have any other odd vegetables knocking about, chuck them in now.  We found a handful of soft tomatoes, so in they went!
| Add the nutmeg, herbs, salt and pepper, bring to the boil and simmer for 10 minutes or until the vegetables are tender
| Leave to cool a little and blend in a food processor, do this in batches if necessary
| Pour back into a clean pan and add the milk and reheat when ready to serve.
| Season to taste with salt and pepper, lemon juice and sherry vinegar. The lemon juice and sherry vinegar have been added to balance the sweetness of the squash, so add more or less or even omit completely, as taste requires.
