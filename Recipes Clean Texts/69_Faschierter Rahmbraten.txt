These look weird, but taste great. It's another great way to use pork.

===Mise en place===
* Preheat oven to 220\u00b0 C (425\u00b0 F - gas 7)
===Method===


| Mix together the sausage ingredients until you have a fairly firm consistency.
| Roll the mixture into a sausage shape and coat lightly in the extra breadcrumbs.
| Melt the lard in a frying pan and quickly brown the meat on all sides.
| Place the meat in a baking dish and add the stock.
| Immediately, reduce the oven temperature to 180\u00b0 C (350\u00b0 F - gas 4) and bake the meat for about 30 minutes, basting frequently.
| Add more stock if necessary.
| Just before serving, mix the cream with the flour, bring to the boil and mix with the meat juices.
===Chef's note===
Automate the process! Place the whole pork steak, quartered onion, bread roll, breadcrumbs, herbs, whole eggs and peeled garlic into a food processor equipped with a metal blade and blend to a rough mince.
===Variations===
Not having a spare bread roll when making this a second time, I used 3 tablespoons of dried packet herby stuffing, reconstituted with a little boiling water. I also a little yellow cornmeal to thicken the sausage mix and also to coat them as I feel it has such a nice flavour.

===Serving suggestions===
Serve with noodles or potato dumplings.
