===Description===

A good dinner party recipe using Jazz apples and black pudding.

===Ingredients===
| 2 oven-ready quail
| A few sprigs of fresh lemon thyme
| Juice of half a lemon
| About 30g (1oz) softened butter
| Salt and freshly ground black pepper
| 1 Jazz apple
| 2 thick slices black pudding
'''For the sauce''':
===Ingredients===NB
| Splash of dry sherry or white wine, optional
| 2 teaspoons cr\u00e8me fraiche


===Mise en place===
* Set the oven to 200\u00b0C/Gas 6
* Put a roasting tin in to heat up
===Method===


| Put a sprig of thyme in each quail, brush the birds with lemon juice then some butter and season well. 
|Heat a frying pan and brown the quails for about 5 minutes. 
|Put them in the roasting tin with the slices of black pudding and cook for 15 minutes then test to see if the quail is cooked by piercing the thigh with a skewer. If the juices run clear it is cooked, if not, cook another 5 minutes. 
|Leave quail (and black pudding) loosely covered in foil, to rest for 5 minutes. 
|Meanwhile cut the top and bottom off the apple then cut it in half across the core to make 2 thick slices. 
|Remove the core. Dip the slices in lemon juice then brush them with butter. 
|Pan-fry the apple slices to brown them well and soften a little.
|Take the legs off the quail, then the wings then ease off the breast meat. Reserve all the pan juices for making the sauce.
|Cut the black pudding to the same size as the apple slices. Place the black pudding, with an apple slice on top, on two hot plates. Arrange the quail breasts and legs on top of that. 
|Heat the pan juices in the roasting tin, adding a really good splash of sherry or wine or water to deglaze it. Let it reduce a little then stir in cr\u00e8me fraiche, to taste, and fresh thyme leaves. Check the seasoning then spoon the sauce onto the plate.
===Serving suggestions===
Serve with game chips or roast potatoes.
===Variations===
Partridge, pheasant and scallops work equally well.
