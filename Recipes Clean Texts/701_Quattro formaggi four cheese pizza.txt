===Description===

My take on the four cheese pizza-dictated by cheeses available at the time.

This was very nice indeed.  I think next time I would reduce the tomatoes and try and find pairings for all of the cheeses. I would keep sliced chillies & cheddar, crushed walnuts & St Agur (soft blue cheese) but need some for Somerset brie and mozzarella.  Suggestions are very welcome!

===Ingredients===
| 1 portion of pizza dough - Makes 2 pizzas
| 6 tablespoons olive oil
| 4 cloves garlic, sliced
| 10 halved baby tomatoes (sungold if you can get them/grow them)
| Copious torn basil leaves
| 125 g Mozzarella cheese ball, torn into pieces
| 80 g strong cheddar cheese, thinly sliced
| 100 g Saint Agur Blue cheese, crumbled
| 90 g Somerset brie, thinly sliced
| 2 green indian chillies, cut into rings
| 4 tablespoons of crushed walnuts
| fine yellow cornmeal for dusting


===Mise en place===
* Make the pizza dough as instructed
* If using a pizza stone, preheat the pizza stone under a very hot grill for about 20 minutes.  Place it about 8cm (3\") from the heat source.

===Method===


| Make 1 pizza per person
| Dust your work surface with yellow cornmeal
| Divide the pizza dough into two and roll out into two thin 25.5 cm (10 inch) pizzas
| Prick the pizzas all over with a fork. This prevents it puffing up too much and burning while it is cooking
| With a deft move, slide the pizza dough from the pizza peel, on to the preheated pizza stone.
| Cook on one side only for about 2 minutes or until lightly browned.
| remove from the oven, flip and add the topping.
| Repeat for the second pizza whilst you prepare the first.
| Meanwhile heat the olive oil and saut\u00e9 the sliced garlic until it just starts to colour, no more or it will be bitter 
| Drizzle the pizza with the half of the olive oil and garlic slices.
| Make a cross with the basil leaves and top with the sliced tomatoes
| Arrange the cheeses in the four quadrants-adding your chosen accompaniments to each cheeses; walnuts and blue cheese, chillies and cheddar, etc.
| Bake the pizza until the cheese starts to melt and bubble-this only takes a few minutes under a hot grill.
| Keep the first pizza warm at the bottom of the oven whilst you make the second.
