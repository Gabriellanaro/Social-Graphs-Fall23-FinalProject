===Description===

This is a modernist jam which uses agar agar to set it.  However, it does not have the keeping qualities of standard jam so it is best to make it in small quantities.
===Ingredients===

| 1 x 500g bag of frozen fruit of your choice, defrosted
| 150g sugar (any sort is fine, but no need for special preserving sugar)
| 1.5g agar agar (generous 1\u00bd teaspoons in powder form)

===Method===


| Mix the fruit with the sugar in a saucepan and leave for 15 minutes
| Stir in the agar agar  
| Bring to the boil and cook for a minute, then remove from the heat
| Transfer to hot or warm, clean jars, before it has a chance to set in the pan
| Once cooled, keep refrigerated even if unopened

===Recipe source===
Lightly adapted from a [http://www.molecule-r.com/en/content/45-quick-and-easy-jam Molecule-R] recipe
===Chef's notes===
Keep in the fridge at all times and it should last a couple of weeks at least.  I sterilised my jars, but I am not sure that that is necessary as the jam should be used up quickly.
