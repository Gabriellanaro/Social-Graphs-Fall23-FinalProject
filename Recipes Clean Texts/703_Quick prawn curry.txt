Another recipe sent to me from north of the border by Alastair.

'''Prawn curry'''
===Ingredients===
| 220g Peeled (defrosted) prawns - about 400g when frozen
| 1 medium onion, peeled and sliced - normal white onions are best, the red onion I used gave it a strange blue hue!
| Curry paste or curry powder to taste
'''Mashed potato'''
===Ingredients===NB
| 2 large potatoes, peeled and quartered
| Good splash of milk
| 1 tablespoon butter
| sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
| Extra virgin olive oil
===Method===


| Boil the potatoes for 20 to 25 minutes or until soft
| Mash with the  butter and milk and season to taste
| Heat the oil in a frying pan or wok, add a good grind of pepper but no salt to the oil and fry the sliced onions  until they begin to caramelise
| Add the curry powder or curry paste. Any of the Patek-type curry pastes are good.  About 1 tablespoon should do but add a little at a time - you can't take it out once you've made it too hot!
| Tip the prawns in to the pan and stir meaningfully until they have changed to the colour of the curried onions
| If you want more sauce, just add a little vegetable stock, lager or even water.
===Serving suggestions===
Arrange the mashed potatoes in a ring and pour the prawn/onion mixture into the centre, crack open a bottle of ale and enjoy!
