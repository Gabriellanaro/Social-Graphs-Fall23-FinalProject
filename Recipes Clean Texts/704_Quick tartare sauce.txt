===Description===


I have been experimenting with the best 'quick' tartare sauce recipe. (tartare sauce - US)
This is the best I have found using ingredients from the fridge.  I don't always have gherkins around but it was quite acceptable with pickled onions, especially if you have any fresh dill available.

I find the fresh dill or parsley makes the sauce nicer, even if it may be less authentic

===Ingredients===
| 150 ml mayonnaise - try our cheats mayonnaise, it's quick and easy.
| 2 tablespoons capers, chopped
| 1 small pickled gherkin, chopped
| Squeeze of fresh lemon juice
| Salt and freshly ground black pepper
| 2 tablespoons finely chopped parsley (optional)
| 2 tablespoons finely chopped dill (optional)
===Method===


| Mix all of the ingredients together in a small bowl and serve immediately.
===Storage===
It will keep reasonably well if refrigerated
