Don't know which supermarket you get your hares from though.

 

The Judge 

This is the first time I have made anything with hare, but saw one in the butcher's and decided to give it a go.  It is basically a hare stew with vegetables.

===Ingredients===
| Olive oil
| 500 g hare meat, chopped into very small pieces
| Seasoning to taste
| 1 large onion, diced
| 2 sticks celery, diced
| 2 carrots, julienned
| 2 bulbs garlic or more, finely diced
| 1 tin of chopped tomatoes
| Oregano
| 4 bay leaves
| 150 ml dry sherry
| 75 ml Stock, or more, if needed
===Method===


| Heat a little oil in a large saucepan over a medium heat until it is smoking.
| Brown the hare in batches of three, seasoning each batch before removing from pan.
| Heat some more oil and stew the onion, carrots and celery until soft - stir from time to time.
| Add in the garlic and stew until golden.
| Stir in the tomatoes, herbs and sherry.
| Simmer for 10 minutes and return the hare to the pan.
| Reduce the heat and simmer until the hare is cooked.
| The sauce should be thick, but you may need to top it up with small amounts of stock to stop it from being too thick or sticking.
| Adjust seasoning if necessary.
===Serving suggestions===
Serve on a plate of creamy mashed potatoes.
===Variations===
You can use rabbit or venison instead of the hare. Add a square of bitter chocolate to the sauce if desired.
===Chef's notes===
Hares are a lot larger than rabbits and as there is only one person in our household who will try it, the unused meat will form part of a mixed game terrine.

If you are buying hare on the bone, once the meat has been removed, keep the bones in the freezer to make stock.  We have a 'bone bag' specifically for keeping bones and innards for stock making.
