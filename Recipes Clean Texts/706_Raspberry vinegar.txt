As well as being a fine fruit vinegar for sauces and salad dressings it is also good for sore throats

===Ingredients===
| 2 litres malt vinegar
| 1 kg white sugar
| 1.5 kg freshly picked raspberries


===Mise en place===
* Wash the raspberries by placing them in a colander and running cold water over them
===Method===


| Put the raspberries in a large non-metallic bowl and cover with vinegar
| Protect with a tea-towel and leave for three days to infuse, stirring occasionally
| Strain the liquid into a large pan, discarding the pulp (see Chef's notes below)
| Add the sugar, bring to the boil and boil for 10 minutes
| Bottle in sterilised bottles
===Chef's notes===
Reserve the pulp for addition to fruit puddings.
