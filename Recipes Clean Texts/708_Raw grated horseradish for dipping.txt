===Description===

I discovered this gem accidently, and being a lover of all things hot and spicy, this simple recipe has become my new hottest favourites!

This simple dip is great for dipping chips, chicken pieces, sausages, anything really.  Touch your food in the dip and little pieces of horseradish will stick to it giving you spicy little bursts of flavour.

It is so simple, nothing needed but raw horseradish root and a tiny pinch of salt, no sauce at all.  Just grated horseradish.
