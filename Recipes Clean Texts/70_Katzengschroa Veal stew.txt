===Chef's notes===
For the benefit of those who follow, I have made notes of the quantities that I used whilst testing this recipe.  I also varied some of the ingredients to suit my larder:
* Thyme - 2 x 3\" sprigs, added complete with stems, stems removed when the cooking had been completed.
* Marjoram, mine has gone to seed so I used 1/3 of a teaspoon of dried oregano.
* I have no savory, neither do I have a substitute, so it has been omitted completely. Reminder to self: add savory to my 'grow this next year' list.
* I could not obtain veal on the day so I used rump steak, finely sliced on the diagonal.
* White wine or sherry, 50 ml
* Stock, 100 ml
===Serving suggestions===
Serve with flour dumplings.
