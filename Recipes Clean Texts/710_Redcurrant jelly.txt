Almost unchanged since she first made it, and nice too.

Another favourite from Mrs Beeton's cookbook.

Its one of those recipes that can't really be improved upon.  I love the idea of adding a few raspberries.

Have the fruit gathered in fine weather, July is ideal.

===Ingredients===
| 9 litres [8 quarts] of redcurrants
| To every 600ml (1 pint) of Juice allow:
| 340g (12oz) Sugar
===Method===


| Remove the stalks from the redcurrants.
| Put into a jar and place the jar in a saucepan of boiling water over the heat and let it simmer gently until the juice is well drawn from the currants.
| Strain them through a jelly bag or fine cloth. If a very clear jelly is wanted, do not squeeze them too much, as the skin and pulp from the fruit will be pressed through with the juice and so make the jelly muddy.
| Measure the juice and to each 600ml (1 pint) allow 340g (12oz) of sugar.
| Put into a preserving pan, over the heat and keep stirring the jelly until it is done, carefully removing any scum as it rises, using a wooden or silver spoon for the purpose, as metal or iron ones would spoil the colour of the jelly.
| When it has boiled for 20 to 30 minutes put a little of the jelly on a plate and if firm when cool, it is done.
| Take it off the heat, pour it into small sterilised jars, cover with airtight lids
| Label the pots, adding the year when the jelly was made and store it away in a dry place.
| A jam may be made with the currants, if they are not squeezed too dry, by adding a few fresh raspberries and boiling all together, with enough sugar to sweeten it nicely.

As this preserve is not worth storing away, but is only for immediate eating, a smaller ratio of sugar than usual will be found enough: it answers very well for children\u2019s puddings or for a nursery preserve.
