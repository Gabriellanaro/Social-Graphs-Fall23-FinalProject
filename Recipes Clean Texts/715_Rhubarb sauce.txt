It was very sharp, good with our bass.

===Description===

This quick and easy sauce goes really well with fatty meat for fish such as pork, duck and mackerel and is equally as good as a dessert with a few sweet biscuits or a little custard.

What you don't use now can be frozen for later use.

===Ingredients===
| 6 sticks of rhubarb, washed, topped and tailed
| Grated zest and juice of one orange
| 6 teaspoons of brown sugar (or to taste)
===Method===


| Chop the rhubarb into 5 cm (1\") lengths
| Heat a large frying pan, add the rhubarb, sugar, orange juice and zest and almost cover with cold water.

# Bring to the boil and simmer for 15 to 20 minutes. At the last few minutes, the rhubarb will break down and absorb all of the water.
===Serving suggestions===
Serve hot or cold.
===Chef's notes===
You may want more sugar than this - I like the sauce to be nice and sharp.
