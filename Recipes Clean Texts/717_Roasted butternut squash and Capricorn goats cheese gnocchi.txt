Another interesting and economical way to utilise your annual squash-glut.  And if you've never tried gnocchi, here is your chance.

Many thanks to those nice people at The Lubborn Creamery for giving us permission to reproduce this recipe.

| 250g fresh gnocchi
| 100g diced butternut squash
| A small handful of fresh sage leaves, chopped
| 25g butter
| Olive oil
| sea salt
| Freshly ground black pepper


===Mise en place===
* Preheat the oven to 180\u00b0 C (350\u00b0 F - gas 4), [fan oven 160\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]
===Method===


| Place the butternut squash on a baking tray in the middle of a hot oven. Roast at 180\u00b0C for 20 minutes.
| Add the gnocchi to a pan of salted, boiling water and cook for 3 minutes or according to packet instructions.

===Chef's notes===
For a lighter alternative, use 15g of butter instead of 25g, or a low-fat spread.
