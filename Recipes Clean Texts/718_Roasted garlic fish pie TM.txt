===Description===

This recipe for Thermomix is finished off in the oven.

'''For the pie'''
===Ingredients===TM
| 340g milk
| 160g water
| 500g mixed fish, cut into chunks - use firm fish such as cod, haddock, monkfish, pollack or salmon
| 60g butter or olive oil
| 40g cornflour
| 1½ teaspoons Thermomix vegetable stock concentrate 
| 3 bulbs garlic, roasted and squeezed out from the skin - see here for the method.
'''For the mashed potato'''
===Ingredients===NB
| 750g floury potatoes, peeled and cut into 2cm pieces
| 500g water (use the fish liquid left over from above, and make up to 500g with water)
| ½ teaspoon salt
| 40g butter
| 100g of the steaming water
| 100g milk or cream
| ½ teaspoon nutmeg, grated
| Seasoning, to taste
| Breadcrumbs
| A little extra butter for dotting
===Method===

'''For the pie'''

| Put the milk and water into the TM bowl and insert the internal steaming basket.
| Add the fish to the basket.
| Cook '''10 minutes / 100\u00b0 / Speed 4'''.
| Tip out the fish liquid and reserve.
| Place the fish in a pie dish or casserole.
| Weigh 400g of the fish liquid back into the TM bowl, using extra milk if necessary to make it up to 400g.
| Add the butter or oil, cornflour, Thermomix vegetable stock concentrate and the garlic.
| Cook '''4 minutes / 100\u00b0 / Speed 4'''.
| Taste and season if necessary.
| Pour the sauce over the fish and mix well.
'''For the mashed potato'''

| Having washed the TM bowl (no need to wash the basket at this stage), weigh in the water, add the salt and insert the basket.
| Weigh the potatoes into the basket.
| Cook '''15 minutes / Temp. Varoma / Speed Spoon'''.
| Check the potatoes have been properly cooked and is necessary, cook a few minutes more until tender.
| Drain the potatoes and reserve the steaming water.
| Insert the '''Butterfly Whisk''' and add the butter, steaming water, milk or cream, nutmeg and seasoning with the potatoes.
| Mix '''2-10 seconds / Speed 4''' depending on the desired consistency - I find that 4 seconds is about right.
| Spread the potato over the fish mixture and sprinkle with breadcrumbs.
| Dot some small pieces of butter over the potato.
| Bake at 220\u00b0 C (425\u00b0 F - gas 7), [fan oven 200\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour] for 30-40 minutes until golden brown.
| ('''AGA ovens''':  Bake 30 minutes on rack set on lowest set of runners in the Roasting Oven.)
===Serving suggestions===
Serve with steamed peas or broccoli.
===Recipe source===
* Adapted from a recipe in '''Fast and Easy Cooking''', the Thermomix UK recipe book.
===Variations===
You can also use prawns or scallops in place of the some of the fish.  You can cover with puff pastry instead of potato if preferred.  Add some garlic and/or onion - this will need be saut\u00e9ed in the TM bowl '''before''' steaming the fish.
===Chef's notes===
Usually I find that the potatoes need cooking for 20 minutes.  If bubbling liquid starts to come through the lid, increase spees to 2.  It is best to allow the fish mixture to cool, before adding the potato or it will sink too much into the fish sauce.
