Not sure about your parsnip idea, much nicer when I used carrots instead.

A no-mess, moreish roast. This roasted sausage, parsnip and pear dish with a maple syrup glaze and crispy fried sage is an easy win with guests. The hearty sausage roast recipe is reproduced courtesy of debbie&andrew's sausages.

The prime cuts of shoulder and belly pork in the Harrogate 97% sausages are juicy, with maple syrup bringing out the sweetness of the parsnips and pears. A sprinkle of chopped pecans adds crunch to this delicious roast  feast.
===Ingredients===

| 6 debbie&andrew\u0092s Harrogate 97% Pork Sausages
| 500g parsnips or potatoes, peeled and cut into quarters
| 2 banana shallots or onions, peeled and cut lengthways, keeping the root end on to hold together when baking
| 1 large pear or apple, cored and cut into eighths lengthways
| 2 tablespoons of maple syrup or honey
| Handful of chopped pecans or walnuts
| 10-15 sage leaves
| 30g butter
| Salt and pepper
===Mise en place===

* Preheat your oven top 190\u00b0 C (375\u00b0 F - gas 5), [fan oven 170\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]

===Method===


| In a large shallow casserole dish add a tablespoon of oil and cook the sausages for around 2 minutes until they are coloured.
| Add the parsnips and shallot, season with salt and pepper and stir.
| Bake in the oven for 25 minutes, giving a shake once or twice.
====whilst the sausages and parsnips are cooking in the oven:====

| In a frying pan, heat the butter and once foaming add the pears, frying off for 5 minutes until the flesh is caramelised and golden brown. Remove and rest on a plate until needed.
| In a small saucepan, deep-fry the sage in oil. Remove with a slotted spoon and blot with kitchen paper to remove excess oil.
| After 25 minutes of baking, add the pears and pecans to the sausages and drizzle with the maple syrup. Bake for a further 10 minutes.
===Serving suggestions===
Place in the middle of the table and scatter with the crispy sage leaves.
===Variations===
Chunks of blue cheese can be added at the end for a more indulgent dish.
