===Description===

This recipe has been adapted for the Thermomix from a '''[http://www.channel4.com/4food/recipes/popular-dishes/soup/roasted-tomato-soup-recipe Come Dine With Me]''' recipe.  The orginal is quite chunky but here I have made it into a smooth, thick soup.  I have also tweaked around a bit with the ingredients.

See '''Variations''' below for the conventional method of making this.

===Ingredients===TM
| 1kg ripe tomatoes, quartered
| 360g onions, cut into thick wedges
| Garlic, to taste
| 2 red peppers, quartered and deseeded
| 100ml olive oil
| Salt
| 4 chillies, seeds left in (optional)
| 300ml water
| 4 teaspoons vegetable bouillon powder
| 2 tablespoons sherry vinegar
| 4 dashes of Worcestershire sauce
| Seasoning
| Few sprigs fresh parsley


===Mise en place===
* Preheat the oven to 220\u00b0C/fan 200\u00b0C/gas 7
===Method===


| Put the tomatoes, onions, garlic, and peppers into a large roasting tin. 
| Drizzle with olive oil and roast for 45 minutes until tender and beginning to char.
| Put the roasted vegetables in the TM with the chillies, stock, sherry vinegar, and Worcestershire sauce. 
| Blend for '''40-50 seconds / Speed 10''', until smooth.
| Reheat '''100\u00b0 / 4 minutes / Speed 2'''.
| Check seasoning, serve, garnished with the parsley.
===Serving suggestions===
Serve as a light lunch with bread, cheese and fruit
===Variations===
To make this conventionally roast the vegetables as instructed, blend in a food processor or liquidiser with the remaining ingredients and reheat in a saucepan.
===Chef's notes===
This recipe may not need additional seasoning, so taste before you add any salt or pepper at the end.  This also make a good cold soup.
