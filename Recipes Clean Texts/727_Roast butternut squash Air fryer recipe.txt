===Description===

I so love my Air Fryer - the best kitchen gadget ever purchased - It is used endlessly!

This is not really a recipe, just proof that it can be done and how well it works.

I added a teaspoon of spices to jazz it up a little - use your favorite spices or herbs.

If you need to add salt then do that after the butternut squash has been roasted as it will cause liquid to leech out of the squash if you add it beforehand.
===Ingredients===

| 1 small butternut squash peeled, deseeded and cut into thumb-sized pieces.
| 2 teaspoons of olive oil
| 1 teaspoon of cumin seeds (optional)
| A large pinch of black pepper

===Method===


| Add the olive oil to the air fryer
| Tip the squash pieces and the spices
| Jiggle the pan to coat the squash pieces evenly
| Roast in the air fryer for about 20 to 25 minutes, depending upon the size of the pieces.
===Variations===
Any type of squash or pumpkin would work using this method.

Try this with chilli flakes
===Chef's notes===
A small butternut squash is perfect for 2 people and a large should be fine for four.

The optional accessory: Tefal Snacking Mesh Metal Tray / Grid / Basket is great for roasting the squash as it doesn't get broken up by the paddle action.
