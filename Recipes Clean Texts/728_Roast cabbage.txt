===Description===

Just playing around with some produce from Jess, our local smallholder and what we had that might go well with it.
[[Image:Roast cabbage recipe ingredients.jpg|thumb|300px|right|My ingredients - Be original and try your own ideas.]]

===Ingredients===

| 1 small savoy cabbage
| 2 very small eating apples
| A handful of currants
| A teaspoon of muscovado sugar
| A teaspoon of Taste Sensation Italian seasoning
| A teaspoon of taste sensation Lime Juice Powder
| 200 ml chicken stock
===Mise en place===

* Preheat your oven to 190\u00b0 C (375\u00b0 F - gas 5), [fan oven 170\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]

===Method===


| I like to trim the stalks from savoy cabbage, but that's a personal preference.
| Roll up the cabbage leaves in bundles and chop into thin slices
| Quarter the apples and remove cores, leave the skins on.
| Add the cabbage, apples and currants to a roasting pan, sprinkle the sugar and spices over everything.
| Pour the chicken stock over the cabbage and mix well.
| Cover with tin foil and roast at 190\u00b0 C for about an hour - see notes.
===Serving suggestions===
Goes rather well with roast pork!
===Variations===
I've used Taste Sensation lime juice powder because I have it and love it.  You can use about a tablespoon of lime juice instead.

I've also used Taste Sensation Italian Seasoning, you can use  black pepper and a pinch of herbs.
===Chef's notes===
This will be cooked after an hour but could easily be cooked for twice that time and at almost any temperature.  Eg: just add it to whatever else you are cooking at the time.
