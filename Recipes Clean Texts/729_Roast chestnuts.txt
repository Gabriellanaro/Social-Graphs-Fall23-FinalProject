===Description===

These make a delicious hot or cold snack, especially at Christmas. They are also a useful ingredient for stuffing recipes.
[[Image:Roasted chestnuts recipe.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Chestnuts, roasted and chopped]]
===Ingredients===
| 1 kg (2Â¼lb) of raw chestnuts
| Good shake of sea salt

===Mise en place===
* Preheat the grill
or
* Preheat the oven to 200\u00b0 C (400\u00b0 F - gas 6), [fan oven 180\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]

===Method===

| Cut a slit in every chestnut.  This prevents them exploding and making a mess of the oven
| Either: Grill on a tray for about 10 to 15 minutes, turning now and then
| Or Roast in the oven for 30 minutes
| You can add a shake of sea salt before, or after roasting
| Allow to cool so they can be handled
| Peel both layers of skin off, taking care to remove all of the inner layer as it can be rather bitter
| Eat as they are, with a little salt or use as directed in your recipe.
