===Description===

I suppose you could call this recipe Pork Wellington.  It is very similar in style to to beef wellington, but a little less complicated.  

===Ingredients===

| 300g pork tenderloin fillet
| 1 tablespoon olive oil
| 2 shallots, peeled and finely chopped
| 2 cloves of garlic, peeled and crushed
| 150 g of oyster mushrooms, wiped clean and finely chopped
| 1 tablespoon fresh sage leaves, or 1 teaspoon of dried sage
| Grated zest from a tangerine
| 25 g of breadcrumbs
| sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
| 4 sheets of filo pastry
| 15 g butter, melted
===Mise en place===

* Preheat your oven to 200\u00b0 C (400\u00b0 F - gas 6), [fan oven 180\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]

===Method===


| Trim and discard any fat or membranes from the pork fillet
| Add the olive oil and a grind of black pepper to a large non-stick frying pan
| Over a high heat, seal the pork tenderloin on all sides
| Remove from the pan, set to one side and keep warm
| Add the shallots, mushrooms and crushed garlic  and saut\u00e9 gently for 5 minutes
| Remove from the heat and add the tangerine zest, breadcrumbs and a pinch of salt
| On a clean worktop, lay out one sheet of filo pastry and brush with melted butter
| Place another sheet directly over the top, brush with butter and repeat until you have a stack of 4 sheets
| Spread your mushroom mixture over the centre of the filo pastry 
| Pat the fillet dry with a paper towel and place in the centre of the pastry
| Wrap the filo pastry around the pork and tuck the edges in so it is a neatly wrapped parcel
| Place on a lightly greased baking sheet and roast for 30 minutes
| Allow it to rest for 5 minutes before carving into thick slices and serving
===Serving suggestions===
Serve with boiled new potatoes and a green vegetable
