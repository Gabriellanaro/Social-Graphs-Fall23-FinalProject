===Description===

Roast pork, cinnamon and apples.  The perfect combination for Sunday lunch.

===Ingredients===

| 2 kg boneless leg of pork
| Handful of fresh sage leaves
| 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
| Â¼ teaspoon freshly grond cinnamon powder.  A coffee grinder is good for this
| 2 tablespoons of Demerara sugar, jaggery or brown sugar
| 568 ml (1 pint) of dry cider
| 3 red skinned eating apples

| Check the weight of the pork for the meat cooking times
| (25 minutes at 200\u00b0 C per 500g + 25 minutes at 180\u00b0 C)
| That's 1 hour 40 minutes + 25 minutes for a 2 kg joint
| Pat the skin dry with a paper towel and score with a very sharp knife such as a Utility knife
| Make a paste with the oil, cinnamon and sugar and spread all over the joint
| Our the cider into the base of the roasting tray
| Roast for 1 hour 40 minutes, spooning the juices over the joint every 20 minutes
| Core and quarter the apples and wedge under the pork joint
| Spoon the juices over the meat for the final time, reduce the oven temperature to 180\u00b0 C (350\u00b0 F - gas 4), [fan oven 160\u00b0 C] and roast for a further 25 minutes until the pork is properly cooked
| remove from the oven, cover with tin foil and allow to rest for 10 minutes before carving and serving
===Serving suggestions===
Serve with roast potatoes, boiled carrots and a gravy of your choice.
