===Description===

This recipe for roast potatoes is my personal favourite as I like them to be as crispy as possible.
===Ingredients===

| 1kg King Edward or Maris Piper potatoes, peeled and cut to an appropriate size,  Try to cut so that there are no rounded sides
| Olive or groundnut oil or a mixture of both
| Salt
===Mise en place===

* Either:  Soak the potatoes in a pan of cold water for 15 minutes, changing the water every 5 minute OR put the potatoes in a saucepan and run the cold tap over them for 5 minutes.

===Method===


| In a pan of fresh cold water, bring the potatoes to the boil and cook until they are fully cooked and just as they are about to fall apart.
| Carefully transfer the potatoes (one by one) to a colander.
| Leave until any steam has disappeared.
| Meanwhile, add the oil to a roasting tin, to a depth of about 5mm and sprinkle in some salt.
| Place the tin in the oven and preheat 250\u00b0 C (475\u00b0 F - gas 9), [fan oven 230\u00b0 C].
| Once the oven has heated, quickly and gently transfer the potatoes to the pan and turn them over so that they are coated in oil.
| Return the tin to the oven and reduce the oven temperature to 180\u00b0 C (350\u00b0 F - gas 4), [fan oven 160\u00b0 C].
| Roast for about 1 hour - 1 hour 20 minutes, turning the potatoes every 20 minutes.  
| The cooking times can vary, but the potatoes will be ready when they are crisp and golden all over.
| Remove from the oven and serve.
===Chef's notes===
You need to get to know your own oven as far as a cooking times are concerned.  I suggest you do a couple of trial runs to start with.
