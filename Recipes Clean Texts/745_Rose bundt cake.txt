===Description===

This recipe requires the use of a [https://www.amazon.co.uk/Nordic-Aluminum-Platinum-Bundt-Black/dp/B00006JSVI/ref=sr_1_11?ie=UTF8&qid=1461097940&sr=8-11&keywords=nordic+ware+bundt+tins Nordic Ware Rose Bundt tin], but any tin with a volume of 2.3 litres or a little bigger will do fine.
===Ingredients===

| 350g caster sugar
| 115g cream cheese
| 230g softened butter
| 3 large eggs
| 1 tablespoon vanilla extract
| 380g plain flour, sieved
| 65g corn flour, sieved
| 1 generous tablespoon baking powder
| A large pinch salt
| 150ml milk mixed with
| 150ml yoghurt
===Mise en place===

* Grease the tin using cake release - butter or oil will not be sufficient.  Use a pastry brush to ensure that all the nooks and crannies are coated.
* Pre-heat the oven to 180\u00b0 C (350\u00b0 F - gas 4) - do not use the fan.  If you cannot switch off the fan, heat to 160\u00b0 C, cover the tin with foil before putting in the oven, in which case it may need a longer cooking time. 

===Method===


| Cream the sugar, butter and cream cheese in a bowl.
| Add the eggs, one at at time, beating well between each one.
| Add the vanilla.
| Mix the flour, cornflour, baking powder and salt together.
| Add to the sugar and butter mixture, one-third at a time, alternating with the milk and yoghurt, ending with the flour.
| Tip it into the bundt tin  and bash it gently on the work surface to remove any air.
| Bake for one hour or longer until cooked.
| Cool in the tin for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a cooling rack.
| Allow to cool completely.
| Decorate as desired.

===Chef's notes===
This mixture may be a little too much, so make sure sure that you fill the tin no more than three-quarters.  Bake any remaining mixture in a small tin or paper cases.
