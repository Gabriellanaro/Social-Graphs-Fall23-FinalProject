The sun-dried tomatoes are the best!

===Description===

A lovely meatloaf made from ingredients from our local butcher, Russell's Butchers of Upwell, Norfolk and other ingredients found to hand.

This is the second time we've made it and it was lovely.
===Ingredients===

| 2 Russell's steak burgers
| 2 slices of Treacle Cured Bacon from Russell's of Upwell
| Trimmed fat from streaky bacon
| Big pinch of salt and freshly ground pepper
| Â½ teaspoon Taste Sensation Italian seasoning
| 10 cherry tomatoes, half chopped for the meatloaf mix, half to garnish
| 2 tablespoons Taste Sensation Sun-dried Tomatoes Diced
| 2 medium onions, finely chopped
| Large bunch of fresh basil, chopped
| Large bunch of fresh sage, chopped
| 2 cups of home-made breadcrumbs

===Method===


| Chop the meat into small pieces as the blender won't reduce them much more
| Save a few halved tomatoes to garnish the top, add the rest, chopped, to the mixture
| Add all of the ingredients to a food processor with a plastic blade
| Mix well until combined well - you may want to give them an extra knead by hand to be sure
| Line a baking tin with greaseproof paper
| Pack the tin with the meatloaf mix
| Top with halved tomatoes
| Cover with a layer of tin foil
| Cook in an air-fryer for 1 hour at 180\u00b0C

===Serving suggestions===
We, oddly, served this with spaghetti mixed into a can of mushroom soup!
===Chef's notes===
This will stretch to four people, or two pigs, with a little left over for breakfast!
