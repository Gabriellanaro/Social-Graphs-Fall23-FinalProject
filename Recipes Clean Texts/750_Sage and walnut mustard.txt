===Description===

Making you own condiments is so easy and always better then commercial offerings.  Modify vigorously to suit your personal taste.

===Ingredients===
| 100g mustard seeds.
| 250 ml white wine.
| 100 ml sherry vinegar.
| 1 teaspoon sea salt
| 75g walnuts, crushed with the palm of your hand.
| 4 sprigs of fresh sage, about 35 sage leaves, stems removed.
===Method===


| Pour the wine and vinegar into a bowl and add the mustard seeds, leave for 24 hours.
| Place the mustard and wine in a food processor with a metal blade and add the sage, salt and walnuts , reserving a few walnuts for the end.
| Process to a paste, the finer the blend the hotter it will be.
| Add the remaining walnuts and pulse a few times leaving some roughly chopped nuts in the mustard.
| Store in a sterilised jar.
