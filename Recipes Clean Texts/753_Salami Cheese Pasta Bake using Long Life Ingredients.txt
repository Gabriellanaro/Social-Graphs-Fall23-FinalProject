===Description===

In the advent of the Coronavirus event and being mindful of cooking with long life ingredients,  I thought I would do some experiments with pasta.  This is the successful result of a few experiments.

All of the ingredients are long life and make a pretty reasonable meal even after they have been stored for many months.

The only item that might be more difficult to source is the cheese powder,  although cheese can be successfully frozen, so you could use that.
===Ingredients===

| 400 ml water
| 50 g of milk powder
| or 400 ml of Milk
| 40g of Taste Sensation cheese powder
| 40g Olive oil
| 30g plain flour
| 60 g of salami or pepperoni, sliced.
| 150 g of pasta
===Mise en place===

* Preheat your oven to 180\u00b0 C (350\u00b0 F - gas 4), [fan oven 160\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]

===Method===


| Boil the pasta in plenty of water, to which a good pinch of salt has been added.
| Drain and reserve
| Make up the milk from the milk powder by whisking the powder into the milk until combined.
| Whisk in the cheese powder to the milk.
| Add the olive oil to a saucepan and heat gently.
| Stir in the plain flour until combined into a roux (a floury paste).
| Pour the milk into the pan and whisk to combine the roux into the cheesey milk.
| Bring to a rolling simmer while stirring as the sauce thickens.
| Mix the drained pasta into the sauce and pour into the sauce.
| Pour the pasta sauce into an oven dish and dot with the salami slices.
| Allow your cat to examine the results!
| Bake in the middle of the oven at 180\u00b0 C for about 30 minutes.

===Variations===
Optionally add a chopped onion and 3 cloves of garlic, crushed to the olive oil and fry off before making the roux.
