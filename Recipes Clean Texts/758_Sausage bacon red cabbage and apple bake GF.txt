===Ingredients===

| 1 pack Debbie and Andrew's Harrogate 97% Gluten Free Pork Sausages
| 1tsp sunflower oil
| 8 rashers smoked bacon, chopped
| 600g red cabbage, shredded
| 1 tablespoon butter
| 2 Cox's apples, peeled, cored and cut into wedges
| A pinch of caster sugar
| A handful of raisins
====for the dressing:====
===Ingredients===NB
| 1 tablespoon honey
| 1 tablespoon gluten free wholegrain mustard
| 3 tablespoons olive oil
| 1 tablespoon cider vinegar
| Salt and pepper

===Method===


| Part-bake your sausages in a lightly oiled baking tray in the preheated oven for 5 minutes,  shaking the pan once or twice during that time. Remove and put to one side. When cool enough to  handle, cut into bite size chunks.
| To make the dressing, simply whisk all the ingredients in a bowl, then put to one side.
| Heat the oil a large frying pan and cook the bacon until crispy and golden. Add the cabbage to  the pan and stir-fry for 5 minutes. Tip into a bowl and toss with half the dressing.
| Heat a knob of butter in the same frying pan and cook the part-cooked sausages in the oil and  bacon juices. Remove and put to one side.
| Turn up the heat and fry the dessert apples in a knob of butter in the same pan. Add the raisins, sprinkle with the sugar and cook until caramelised.
| Now add the cabbage mix and the sausage pieces back to the pan and warm everything through together. Add more dressing to taste and toss in the pan.
===Serving suggestions===
