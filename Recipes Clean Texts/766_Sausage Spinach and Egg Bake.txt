Perfect Cumberland Sausages and mushrooms with spinach and baked eggs, covered in cheese sauce and baked until golden. A quick, delicious weekend brunch, this is one-pan cooking at its best, just serve at the table and let everyone tuck in.
===Ingredients===

| 4 x Debbie and Andrew's Butcher's Classic Cumberland Sausages, cooked and sliced 
| 100g spinach, cooked
====for the bake====
===Ingredients===NB
| 100g mushrooms, fried and sliced (I used re-hydrated wild mushrooms)
| 4 free range eggs
| Oil for cooking
| Butter for cooking (use a Dairy Free alternative if preferred)
====for the cheese sauce:====
===Ingredients===NB
| 30g butter
| 25g plain flour (use gluten free if preferred)
| 350ml milk (use a Dairy Free alternative if preferred)
| 130g grated cheese (use a Dairy Free alternative if preferred)
| Salt & pepper
| Nutmeg
===Mise en place===

* Preheat your grill

===Method===


====cheese sauce:====

| Melt the butter in a saucepan, add the flour to make a roux and cook off for 3 minutes.
| Slowly pour in the milk, stirring to create a b\u00e9chamel. Cook for 5-6 minutes, mixing so the bottom does not catch.
| Add the cheese, season, take off the heat and cover with greaseproof paper so a skin does not form.
====the bake:====

| Fry off the mushrooms in a knob of butter, season and rest on a plate.
| Fry the sausage slices in the same pan with some oil for 3-4 minutes until they start to caramelise. Transfer to the same plate as the mushrooms.
| Add a little more oil to the pan, then break in the eggs. As soon as they start to go white, scatter the sausages, mushrooms and spinach over them.
| Next and as quickly as possible pour the cheese sauce over the top, sprinkle with the remaining cheese and place under the hot grill until golden and bubbling.
| Serve in the pan immediately.
===Serving suggestions===
Serve directly from the pan, immediately.
===Variations===
Serve with potatoes for a hearty supper
