[[Image:Sausage, tomato and pepper bake with balsamic vinegar recipe.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Ready to bake]]
Another sticky gravy tray bake, this time using Debbie & Andrew's sausages, as they seem to be the best quality sausages available from the supermarkets at a reasonable price.

Add any of your favourite vegetables to this dish to liven it up. Even small new potatoes would work well, although they might need to be par-boiled for 15 minutes first just to ensure they soften up.  They would be great to soak up the dark sticky gravy.
===Ingredients===

| 1 medium onion, peeled and sliced
| 4 Debbie and Andrew's Harrogate 97% Pork Sausages
| 3 cloves of garlic, peeled and crushed
| 1 yellow pepper, seeds removed and sliced
| 1 teaspoon dried oregano
| 350g cherry tomatoes, left uncut
| 1 sprig of rosemary
| 1 sprig of thyme
| 2 bay leaves
| 3 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
| 3 tablespoons of olive oil
| sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
===Mise en place===

* Preheat your oven to 190\u00b0 C (375\u00b0 F - gas 5), [fan oven 170\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]

===Method===


| Chose a fairly small baking tray and add 2 tablespoons of olive oil and a good grind of black pepper.
| Pop the oven try on the hob and put it on a high heat.
| Add the sausages, sliced sweet pepper and the sliced onions and brown them.  You'll need to keep moving them about because they won't heat as evenly as they would in a frying pan.
| Once everything has taken a tiny bit of colour, add the garlic and stir-fry for a minute or so, then remove the tray from the heat.
| Add the halved tomatoes, herbs and balsamic vinegar to the sausages and stir well.
| Season with a pinch of salt and pour over the remaining olive oil.
| Bake in the top half of the oven for 30 minutes, then mix everything up again and cook for a further 30 minutes.
| If the gravy looks to be too liquid, place the baking tray on the hob on a high heat for 5 minutes, stirring now and then.
===Serving suggestions===
Serve from the oven dish with slices of stoneground bread to soak up the delicious gravy.
===Chef's notes===
Although this Debbie and Andrew's recipe suggests heating the sausages, peppers, onions et al, in a roasting tray, I found it more convenient to do the browning in a large wok or frying pan and then transfer the part-cooked items to a preheated roasting tray and finish in the oven.

The original recipe suggested halving the tomatoes but after making this dish many times I think it's nicer to leave them whole.  There's less liquid produces and you get the exquisite flavour bombs everytime you bite into one.
===Variations===
Add a chopped deseeded dried Chile de Arbole for a livelier version!

Sliced mushrooms added a nice meaty bite to this dish.
