After a game of rugby, the main goal for most players is to tuck into a hearty meal. However, with the increase in food sensitivities, the challenge for many organisers is to make sure everyone on the team can eat the meal!

Debbie& andrews Harrogate 97% Pork Sausages are wheat, gluten and dairy free, a perfect option for people with the common food intolerances.
===Ingredients===

| 1 tablespoon sunflower oil
| 1 pack of debbie&andrew's Harrogate 97% Pork Sausages
| 2 leeks, peeled and chopped
| 2 sticks celery, chopped
| 1 onion, chopped

| 2 courgettes, chopped
| 1 x 400g tin chopped tomatoes
| 1 chicken stock cube
| 200ml white wine
| 1 tablespoon dried mixed herbs
| Salt and pepper
| 4 potatoes, peeled and diced
| 2 sweet potatoes, peeled and diced
| 2 tablespoons milk
| 1 tablespoon butter
| 3 tablespoons creme fraiche

* Preheat your oven to 190\u00b0 C (375\u00b0 F - gas 5), [fan oven 170\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]

===Method===


| Heat the oil in a large frying pan. Add the sausages to the pan and fry over a gentle heat for 10 minutes until browned.
| Now add the leeks, celery, onion, garlic and courgettes to the pan and cook for 5 minutes more.

| Add the creme fraiche to the frying pan and stir in gently. Simmer for 5 minutes then transfer to a casserole or pie dish.
| Top with the mashed potato mixture and level evenly. Cook in the preheated oven for half an hour and serve with baked beans - delicious
