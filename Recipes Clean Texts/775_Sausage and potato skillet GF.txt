===Description===

This warming winter gluten free recipe comes courtesy of debbieandandrew's sausages.  It can be cooked indoors or outdoors on the barbecue - a great meal for bonfire night.

It's an ideal Autumn recipe as it uses seasonal vegetables that are easily available from supermarkets or your garden if you are lucky enough to be growing them.
===Ingredients===

| 1 pack debbie&andrew's gluten free sausages
| 6 cooked potatoes, chunked and par boiled
| ¼ butternut squash, cubed and par boiled
| 2 leeks, washed and thinly sliced
| ½ red pepper
| 100g lactose free cheese, grated 
| 2 spring onions, chopped
| Olive oil

===Method===


| If cooking indoors turn on grill to full, if outdoors bring coals to white hot heat then:
| Heat olive oil in a large heavy based saucepan 
| Fry debbie&andrew's sausages until golden brown, at least 20 minutes then remove from pan
| Fry off leeks, potatoes, butternut, red pepper till soft and golden
| Add sausages back to mix
| Sprinkle top with cheese and spring onions
| If cooking indoors, complete by placing the whole pan under grill until cheese is melted and golden, about 5 minutes. 
| Serve hot.
