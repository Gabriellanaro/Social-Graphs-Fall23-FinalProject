===Description===

A simple easy to cook sausage stew that goes well with crusty bread which means that no more cooking is needed. It's ready to eat the moment you get home.

This freezes well for microwave reheating.

===Ingredients===

| 400 g (1 pack) of your favourite sausages
| Good grind of fresh black pepper
| 2 tablespoons olive oil
| 1 large onion, peeled and sliced
| 2 cloves of garlic, peeled and crushed (or to taste)
| 2 medium carrots, peeled and thinly sliced into 'coins'
| 1 large leek, washed and sliced into 'coins'
| 2 tablespoons plain flour
| 400 ml beef stock made with 1 beef Oxo cube
| 3 tablespoons Branston pickle
| 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
===Method===



| Heat the oil in a frying pan or a wok and add the black pepper.  Once it is sizzling, carefully add the sausages and brown for a few minutes until nicely coloured.
| Add the onions, carrots and leeks and saut\u00e9 for 5 minutes until softened but not coloured.
| Shake the flour into the pan and mix until the oil is absorbed.
| Mix in the stock, bring to the boil, stirring all the while.
| once it has thickened, remove from the heat, stir in the remaining items and taste and adjust seasoning if needed.
| Carefully pour the mixture into the slow-cooker crock pot and cook for 5 to 8 hours.  Medium setting should be fine for most slow cookers.
