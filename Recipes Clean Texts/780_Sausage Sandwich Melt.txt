Mine was Top Job, but I did it in a Breville Sandwich Maker.

===Description===

The special sausage sandwich recipe is reproduced courtesy of debbie&andrew's sausages.
[[Image:Caramelised-red-onion-sausages.png|300px|thumb|right|Debbie & Andrew's Caramelised Red Onion Pork Sausages]]
Golden and crisp on the outside, with chunky pea pesto, creamy avocado and sweet Caramelised red onion pork sausages which are simply mouth watering with the melted cheese. We can't think of a better hangover alternative to the bacon butty, and yes, the Club Sandwich is rewritten!

====for the sandwiches====
===Ingredients===NB
| 4 Debbie & Andrew's Caramelised Red Onion Pork Sausages
| 1 avocado
| 4 x 25g slices of Gouda cheese (any mild cheese will work) (use a Dairy Free alternative if preferred)
| 2 tablespoons mayonnaise (use a Dairy Free alternative if preferred)
| 4 slices of sourdough bread (use gluten free if preferred)
| 50g butter (use a Dairy Free alternative if preferred)
====for the pea pesto:====
===Ingredients===NB
| 100g fresh frozen peas, boiled or steamed
| 1 garlic clove, crushed
| 30g pine nuts, toasted
| 30g fresh parmesan cheese, chopped into small chunks (use a Dairy Free alternative if preferred)
| Handful fresh mint & basil leaves - around 10g of each
| 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil

===Method===


| Bake the sausages for 10 minutes or until done to your liking. Rest for 10 minutes then slice in half lengthways.
| Add pesto ingredients to a food processor and combine. Season to taste. Any left over pesto can be covered tightly and frozen.
| Slice the avocado in half, remove the seed, scoop out the flesh and slice into thin strips.
| Take a slice of bread, spread with a heaped tablespoon of pea pesto, add 4 sausage halves, then one half of the avocado slices and 2 slices of cheese and season with salt and pepper. Spread a tablespoon of mayonnaise over the remaining slice of bread and place the mayonnaise side down on top of the cheese. Push together slightly to form the sandwich.
| Butter the sandwich on the outside and toast in a frying pan for 3-4 minutes on both sides.
| Place the pan into an oven for 5 minutes to melt the cheese.
| Place on kitchen paper to absorb any oil, slice in half and serve.
===Chef's notes===
Pea pesto works amazingly well with sausages, and could even be stirred through mashed potato to liven up bangers and mash. Buttering the outside of the bread helps create a golden crust. If you don't have gouda - any mild cheese will work!
