They were so good, and so much nicer than shop-bought Scotch eggs.

===Description===


Scotch eggs are easy to make at home and you can tinker with them to add your favourite flavouring or coating.

16 sausages, 2 packs, make 8 meaty Scotch eggs.

They don't actually need to be coated with anything providing you cook them on a non-stick surface. Panko breadcrumbs work well. For this batch I used a mixture of black & white poppy seeds. sesame seeds are very good too.

After trying many varieties of sausages I have found the nicest tasting were Morrisons own brand sausages.  They are also economical [from 97p to \u00a31.65 for 454 grams - March 2018] Another advantage of these is that the sausagemeat is really easy to extract from the sausages because the skins are so loose on the uncooked sausages.
===Ingredients===

| 2 packs of Morrisons own brand sausages [454 g per pack]
| 8 medium free range eggs - ensure the eggs are at least 4 days old or you will be unable to peel them easily.
| Optional flavourings and coatings
===Mise en place===

* Add the eggs to a pan of warm water and bring to the boil and boil for 5 minutes.  Remove the pan from the heat and allow to cool.
* Peel the hard-boiled eggs using a teaspoon.  Doing this under a trickle of water sometimes makes the task a little easier.
* Preheat your oven to 180\u00b0 C (350\u00b0 F - gas 4), [fan oven 160\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]

===Method===


| Squeeze the sausagemeat from 16 raw sausages into a bowl.
| If you are going to add any flavourings to the sausage meat, do this now.
| Using your hands - latex gloves make this easier - squidge the sausage meat together so it's mixed well.  Especially if your using a mixture of sausages.
| Weigh out about 110g of sausage meat and make a round pattie - about 13 cm [5 inches] in diameter.
| Place a hard-boiled egg in the centre of the pattie and work it into a ball, ensuring there is no ''seam''.
| If you are going to coat them, sprinkle your coating onto a large plate and roll the scotch eggs around in the mixture until they are completely covered.
| Place the eggs on o non-stick baking tray or a baking tray covered with grease-proof paper.
| Bake in the oven for 40 minutes, turning once.
| Allow to cool and serve.
===Variations===
Try coating with breadcrumbs, poppy seeds or sesame seeds.
