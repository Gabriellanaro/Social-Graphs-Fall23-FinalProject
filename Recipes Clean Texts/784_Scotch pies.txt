Right old fiddle to make.  I can never get them perfect like the butchers do.

===Description===

Scotch pies are small raised pies, filled with either beef or mutton and sealed with a lid that sits s little inside the shell.

These pies are filled with beef

'''for the pie filling'''
===Ingredients===
| 700g (1.5 lb) lean minced beef
| 300g (10.5 oz) white rusks, crushed with a rolling pin (use baby rusks)
| 25 g (1 oz) seasoning 3:1 (salt to white pepper)
| A beaten egg to glaze
'''for the pastry'''
===Ingredients===NB
| 300 ml (10 fl oz) water
| 225 g (8 oz) dripping or lard
| 700 g (1.5 lb) self raising flour
| 1 teaspoon sea salt


===Mise en place===
* Prepare the pie casings the day before so you can leave them overnight to harden
===Method===


| Add the fat and water to a pan and boil it until the fat has melted.
| Warm a large bowl and sift the flour and salt into it
| Pour in the liquid and mix with a wooden spoon
| Once cool enough to handle, knead until it is smooth and elastic.
| Cover with a damp cloth and leave in a warm place for an hour.
| Roll the pastry out so you enough cases to fill 15 to 20 pie moulds, bun or muffin tins with enough pastry left over to make lids.
| Leave the shells and lids in a cool place overnight to harden off. A fridge is good for this.
| The next day, preheat the oven to 190\u00b0 C (375\u00b0 F - gas 5)
| Mix the mince and rusks and seasoning together with a little ice-cold water so it has a stiff consistency
| Fill the shells, no more than ¾ full, press on the lids, cut a slit or a hole in each lid and then glaze with the beaten egg.
| Bake for 25 minutes or until golden brown.
| Serve hot.
===Chef's note===
If you don't wish to make as many as 15 or 20 in one go, freeze a batch, un-cooked for baking at a later date.
