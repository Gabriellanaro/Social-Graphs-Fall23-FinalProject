===Description===

This is the proper stuff as it should be made!

===Ingredients===
| 250ml water
| 35g medium oatmeal
| Salt to taste - you only need a little
===Method===


| Bring the water to the boil in a non-stick saucepan.
| Add the porridge in a steady trickle whilst stirring vigorously - there should be no lumps.
| Reduce the heat, cover and gently simmer for about 15 minutes.
| Stir in the salt, cover and simmer for a further 5 minutes or so.
| You will know when it is done as the oatmeal will have absorbed the water to such an extent that it has a crater appearance when simmer.
===Serving suggestions===
I love this with a generous pouring of cold milk.
===Variations===
Add a little sugar if you wish, but do not omit the salt.
