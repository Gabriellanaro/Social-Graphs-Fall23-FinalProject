A meat and noodle dish from the South Tyrol, which is similar to the Italian ravioli.  It can be served on its own or part of a main course.

===Ingredients===
| 250 g flour, sieved with a pinch of salt
| 2 free range eggs
| 30 ml water
| 175 g cooked meat of your choice, chopped
| 30 ml gravy
| 2 tablespoons parsley, chopped
| 1 egg, lightly beaten
| 180 ml Meat stock (optional)
===Method===


| To make the noodle dough, put the sieved flour, salt and eggs into a blender, with the water to make a soft, pliable ball of dough.
| Knead by hand, briefly and roll out into a thinnish sheet.
| To make the filling, mix the meat, gravy, parsley and the egg.
| Cut the dough in half and place teaspoons of the meat mixture, well and evenly spaced over one half of the dough.
| Using a pastry brush and water, dampen between each pile of mixture.
| Place the other half of the dough over the top and lightly press it down around each pile of mixture.
| Cut into squares and poach gently in broth or water for 10-15 minutes.
===Serving suggestions===
These can be served in the broth as a soup or drained and  served with some butter and a hard, grated Alpine cheese such as Austrian Gruy\u00e8re.
===Chef's notes===
To save time, you may wish to use a pasta machine to roll out the dough and place over a ravioli tin to speed up the filling and cutting process.
