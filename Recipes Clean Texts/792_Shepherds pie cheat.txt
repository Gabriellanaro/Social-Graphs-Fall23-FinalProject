===Description===

Anne makes this when we are short of time and long on hunger.  It's really quick and easy and lasts us for 2 days.  A good strong cheese makes all the difference to this simple recipe.

===Ingredients===
| A few tablespoons of olive oil for frying the onions and garlic
| 1 medium onion, chopped
| 2 cloves of Garlic, crushed (or to taste)
| 450g minced lamb or mutton
| Â½ teaspoon dried mixed herbs
| 1 450g can baked beans
| 1 450g can plum tomatoes, chopped
| 2 tablespoons of gravy granules or a crumbled beef stock cube
| A dash of Worcestershire sauce
'''Topping'''
===Ingredients===NB
| 4 medium / large potatoes, peeled and quartered
| 1 tablespoon of butter
| A dash of milk or cream
| Salt and freshly ground black pepper
| 4 tablespoons of strong Cheddar cheese, grated


===Mise en place===
* Preheat the oven to 180\u00b0 C (350\u00b0 F - gas 4)
===Method===

I know Delia Smith would have us use frozen mash potatoes for a Cheat's Recipe, but I really can't bring myself to buy frozen mash, so...

| Boil the potatoes for about 20 minutes, mash with the butter, seasoning and a dash of milk or cream.
| Meanwhile, fry the onions and garlic until softened, about 5 minutes.
| Add the mince and fry for a 3 or 4 minutes.
| Add the onions and mince to a large oven proof casserole dish.  You can of course do the frying in that too if it is suitable.
| Add the chopped tomatoes, baked beans, mixed herbs and stir well.  Sprinkle the gravy granules or stock cube over the mixture, add a dash of Worcestershire sauce and give it one final mix.
| Carefully layer the mashed potato on the top and using a fork, create plenty of peaks so they brown and crisp during the baking.
| Top with grated cheese and bake for 20 minutes until the top is golden-brown.
===Serving suggestions===
Serve with peas.
