===Description===


Shortbread, a biscuit traditionally made from one part white sugar, two parts butter, and three parts oatmeal (although plain white flour is more common today)

Quick and easy to make, don't eat too many of them!

===Ingredients===
| 125 g (4 oz) butter at room temperature
| 55 g (2 oz) caster sugar
| 180 g (6 oz)  plain flour, sifted


===Mise en place===
* Preheat the oven to 190\u00b0 C (375\u00b0 F - Gas 5)

===Method===


| Beat the butter and the sugar together
| Mix in the flour to get a smooth paste
| Turn out to a work surface and gently roll out until the paste is 1 cm (Â½ in) thick.
| Cut into rounds or fingers and sprinkle with a little extra caster sugar, prick with a fork to make a pattern on the top
| Place on a baking sheet and chill for 20 minutes
| Bake for 15-20 minutes until pale golden
| Cool on a wire grid
