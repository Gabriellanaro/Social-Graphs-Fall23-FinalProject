Sounds like boiled beef; it's way better than that!

===Description===

Silverside of beef is an inexpensive cut of meat and despite what supermarkets tell you to do with it, it is not suitable for traditional roasting.  It needs to be cooked very slowly in some sort of liquid, otherwise it will become tough and dry. 

This is a version of Slow cooked silverside of beef adapted for a pressure cooker.

We would not normally buy a joint of this size for just two of us, but it seemed good value and will last for at least 3 days.

This was fabulous - thank you Julia for the inspiration!

===Ingredients===
| 2 kg (4 lb) joint of beef silverside
| 2 tablespoons oil
| Freshly ground black pepper
| 4 medium carrots, peeled and sliced
| 3 sticks of celery, coarsely chopped
| 10 dried shiitake mushrooms
| 500ml hot beef stock
| 1 bottle of robust red wine
| 6 large cloves of garlic, peeled
| 1 large onion, sliced
| 2 tablespoons tomato puree
| A squeeze of lemon juice
| 3 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
| 1 Bouquet garni - made up from what was in the garden at the time: sage, rosemary, parsley, cutting celery, bay leaves.


===Mise en place===
* Preheat the slow cooker for a few minutes.

===Method===


| Pat the joint dry and cover with a good grind of black pepper
| Leaving the ''netting'' on the joint, heat the oil in a frying pan and sear the meat for about 3 minutes on each side.
| Chop the dried mushrooms into quarters
| Add the carrots, onions, garlic, mushrooms to the pressure cooker and sit the seared meat on top, jiggle it around a little if you need more room.
| Deglaze the meat pan with a little red wine and add that to the mix.
| Pour over the remaining red wine, beef stock, Worcestershire sauce and tomato pur\u00e9e and mix well.
| Fit the lid, bring up to pressure and cook on high pressure for 3 hours.
| Depressurise naturally
| Remove the silverside from the pressure cooker and allow to rest, under tented foil for 15 minutes.
| Using a slotted spoon, ladle just more than half of the vegetables and a little stock into a food processor and blend to make a gravy.
| Add the gravy back to the pan with the remaining vegetables, add a few tablespoons of yellow cornmeal if it needs thickening.  Bring back to the boil, uncovered, for a short while to thicken when ready to serve.
| Slice the silverside, reheat the gravy and serve.
===Chef's notes===
I don't profess to be a pressure cooker expert, so 3 hours may be rather a long time to cook this joint-however, it was melt-in-the-mouth tender and almost all of the gelatinous tissues had melted away.  The meat still had plenty of flavour.

This fabulous recipe has lasted us for 5 days!  We have had it with jacket potatoes & vegetables, filled Yorkshire puddings and vegetables, with homemade pasta, with couscous and tonight, turned into Mexican meatballs in a bolognaise sauce with spaghetti.

The trick was to separate the gravy and the cooked meat as soon as the meat was cooked.  Because they were separately stored and refrigerated in Lock and Lock-style boxes, the meat could be carved and server with or without the gravy.
