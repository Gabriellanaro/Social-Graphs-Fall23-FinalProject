===Description===


This is a nice easy shepherds pie recipe - see below for more complex versions.

===Ingredients===
| 50g butter
| 1 medium onion, finely diced
| Garlic to taste, crushed (I used 1 bulb)
| A twist or two of freshly ground nutmeg
| 1 large bay leaf
| 450g minced lamb or mutton
| 20 g flour
| 280 ml hot meat stock
| 140 ml milk
| Seasoning
| 3/4 cup of garden peas
| 2 carrots, peeled and sliced
| 1.5 kg potatoes, peeled
| Butter, to taste
===Method===


| Melt the butter over a medium heat and add the onion.
| Allow to stew until soft (about 10 minutes).
| Reduce heat to low and add the garlic .
| Fry for a further 5 minutes, or until the garlic is slightly golden.  Stir from time to time.
| Remove from heat and increase the heat level to medium-high.
| Stir in the nutmeg and bay leaf.
| Return to the heat and add the lamb.
| Allow to stew for a maximum of 10 minutes.
| Slowly stir in the flour, and add the meat stock and the milk.
| Season to taste and add the peas and carrots.
| Simmer for a further 10 minutes and pour into a greased baking dish.
| Allow to go cold.
| In the meantime, boil the potatoes for about 20 minutes.
| Drain and mash with butter and seasoning.
| Rice, if desired.
| Once the lamb is cool, preheat the oven to 180\u00b0 C (350\u00b0 F - gas 4).
| Spread the potatoes over the top and add a few knobs of butter if you like.
| Bake for 20 minutes until the top is golden-brown.
===Serving suggestions===
Serve with gravy.
===Variations===
Add some strong grated cheese to the top of the potato.
