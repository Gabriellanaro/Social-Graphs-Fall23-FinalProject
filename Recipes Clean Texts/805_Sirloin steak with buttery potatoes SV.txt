===Description===

[[Image:Vacuum packed steak and potatoes.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Vacuum packed steak and potatoes]]
Cooking the perfect steak is dead easy using the sous vide method.  You only need to cook it at the right temperature to get it to the required doneness and it will never be overdone.  Another advantage to this method is that the meat will be cooked evenly throughout.

One of the points of this recipe is to demonstrate that you can cook food at different temperatures without using two or three separate water baths.

===Ingredients===

| 2 large baking potatoes, peeled and sliced (up to 50mm thick)
| Salt and pepper
| 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened
| 4 sirloin steaks
| 1/2 a teaspoon of Garlic powder
| 1/2 a teaspoon of Onion powder
| A further 60g unsalted butter
| Olive oil
===Mise en place===

* Preheat your water bath to 84\u00b0C.

===Method===


| Pat the potato slices dry and season them lightly with salt and pepper.
| Place them in a large pouch - they can overlap - and rub them with the butter.
| If you get any butter near the top of the pouch, wipe thoroughly, or it will not seal properly.
| Place in the water bath and cook for 1 hour.
| At the end of this time, reduce the water temperature to 56.5\u00b0C (''133.7\u00b0F'') for a medium-rare steak - see 'Variations' below for rare, well done etc.
| The quickest way to reduce the temperature is to add cold water, removing some of the hot water with the aid of a jug if necessary.
| In the meantime, sprinkle the steaks with pepper, garlic powder and onion powder - the two latter ingredients are often slightly salty, so additional salt may not be necessary.
| Place in separate vacuum bags, and smear 15g butter over each steak, again wiping the top of the pouch if it comes in contact with the butter.
| Keeping the potato slices in the water bath, add the sealed pouches once the correct temperature has been reached - the potatoes will not cook any more but will just be kept warm.
| Cook the steaks for 1-4 hours for steaks of 25 mm thickness or 2-4 hours for 50mm steaks.
| Cut open the pouches containing the steaks and sear for 1 minute each side in a very hot frying pan with a little oil. 
| Allow the steaks to rest for a few minutes before serving with the potatoes.
===Serving suggestions===
Serve with salad or leafy vegetables.
===Variations===
You can use rib-eye steaks or filet mignon if desired.  If you like your steak rare, the water bath should be heated to 49\u00b0C (''120.2\u00b0F''), medium 60\u00b0C (''140\u00b0F''), medium-well 65.5\u00b0C (''149.9\u00b0F'') or well done 71\u00b0C (''159.8\u00b0F'').
