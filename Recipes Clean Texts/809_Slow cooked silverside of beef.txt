This takes a long time to cook, but as it's in the slow cooker you could even cook it on the timer while you're out.  I love the way the meat fibres break up after this long cook.

[[Image:Slow cooked siverside of beef.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Slow-cooker loaded and ready to go!]]
Silverside of beef is an inexpensive cut of meat and despite what supermarkets tell you to do with it, it is not suitable for traditional roasting.  It needs to be cooked very slowly in some sort of liquid, other wise it will become tough and dry.

This recipe is cooked in a slow cooker, but can just as easily be adapted for cooking on the hob or in a low oven or even a pressure cooker.

===Ingredients===
| 800g joint of beef silverside
| 2 tablespoons oil
| 3 medium carrots, peeled and sliced
| 2 sticks of celery, coarsely chopped
| A handful of dried shiitake mushrooms
| 500ml hot beef stock
| 300ml robust red wine
| 2 bulbs garlic, peeled
| 1 large onion, sliced
| 2 tablespoons tomato puree
| 3 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
| 2 teaspoons dried oregano


===Mise en place===
* Preheat the slow cooker for a few minutes.
===Method===


| Heat the oil in a frying pan and sear the meat for about 3 minutes on each side.
| Meanwhile, make a bed with the carrots and celery on the bottom of the slow cooker.
| Place the seared meat on top of the vegetables and add the shiitake mushrooms.
| Pour the stock and wine over the meat, cover and set to 'low'.
| After 2 hours, add the garlic, onion, tomato pur\u00e9e, oregano and Worcestershire sauce.
| Continue cooking for 5 hours.
| Remove the silverside from the slow cooker and allow to rest, under tented foil for 15 minutes.
| Meanwhile, blend the stock and vegetables until smooth, to make a gravy.  You may need to thicken the gravy with a little cornflour or arrowroot.
| Slice the silverside, reheat the gravy and serve.

===Chef's notes===
Last time we made this, there was lots of leftover gravy. So we froze the surplus stock in 150ml plastic coffee cups and then vacuum packed them as little stock lollies.  These have proved to be a highly useful and delicious stock base.  ''When finding them in the freezerI wondered what recipe they came from until re-making this recipe again today!''
