Lots of strange flavours and textures, but nice, all the same

===Description===

This interesting recipe comes courtesy of nik & edwina's cookbook.

This recipe didn\u2019t exactly come about by accident, but there was a series of coincidences and expediencies that ended up with a superb dish - we\u2019d already made the pickle and were wondering what to have it with, and, while we\u2019d forgotten to buy carrots for the coleslaw, we did have half a head of kohlrabi in the fridge, not to mention a head of fennel that needed to be used up

The sweet, lush, grassy flavour of the raw kohlrabi works incredibly well in the coleslaw, the sharp appley flavour of the pickle compliments the pork very nicely indeed, and the fennel on the side adds a nicely aromatic flavour and crunch. The potatoes are in fact optional, they\u2019re there more as a garnish than an accompaniment. Any left over coleslaw and apple pickle will go very well in a cheese sarnie
===Ingredients===

====roast pork====
===Ingredients===NB
| 1 kg pork belly \u2013 a good lean cut, but with skin on 
| 2 medium onions cut into thick slices 
| 16 or so small new potatoes, halved
====pickled apples====
===Ingredients===NB
| 2 sweet crisp apples, peeled, cored and cut into 1cm chunks 
| 250ml cider vinegar or a mix of 125ml cider vinegar and 125ml apple vinegar if you can get it 
| 250ml water 
| 60g soft brown sugar 
| 1 star anise 
| 1 tablespoon chopped dill stalks 
| 1 tablespoon finely chopped dill leaves 
| \u00bd teaspoons salt 
| \u00bd teaspoon ground ginger
====kohlrabi coleslaw====
===Ingredients===NB
| Half a head of Chinese cabbage, cut into 4 segments and cored, then shredded as finely as you can 
| Half a kohlrabi, coarsely grated 
| 1 pack dill, chopped finely, including all but the coarsest stalks (they can be used in the pickling liquor above)
| 4 tablespoons of homemade mayonnaise
| Salt and pepper to taste 
| Half a head of fennel, cored and very finely sliced. Hang on to the feathery leaves for a garnish 
| Ground nut oil
| Salt and pepper
===Mise en place===

* 250\u00b0 C (475\u00b0 F - gas 9), [fan oven 230\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]

===Method===


| Pack the onion and potatoes onto the bottom of your roasting tin to create a platform for the meat. Score the skin of the pork belly to create a 1cm grid all over, about 5 mm deep. Rub with groundnut oil and salt, and place it on top of the veggies, skin side up. Turn your oven on to 240C, then put the roasting tin in and cook for 20-25 minutes or so until the skin is browned all over. Turn the oven down to 160\u00b0 C (325\u00b0 F - gas 3), [fan oven 140\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour] and add a little boiling water to the roasting tin to stop the veggies from burning. Continue cooking for a further 2 hours adding a little boiling water every half hour or so if necessary 
| Once cooked, remove the pork from the roasting tin and allow it to rest. Using a slotted spoon, remove the potatoes and onions and keep warm. Separate the meat from the crackling; if you have a cook\u2019s blow torch this is a good time to give the pork crackling a quick blast of heat to ensure that it is really crisp. 
====Meanwhile, prepare the Pickle Apples:- ====

| Fill a 1 litre jar with apple chunks and chopped dill leaves 
| Combine vinegar with water, chopped dill stalks, sugar, salt and ginger in a medium saucepan, and bring to a boil. Simmer for 5 minutes, stirring, making sure all the sugar dissolves. Sieve the hot mixture over the apple chunks, close the lid and refrigerate, preferably overnight. It will keep for up to two weeks 
====The Coleslaw:- ====

| Put the cabbage, kohlrabi and dill leaves into a large bowl. Gently stir in 2 tablespoons of mayonnaise. If it needs some more, add one more. Season, put in a lunchbox, keep in the fridge. It\u2019ll last about 4 days 
| With half an hour to go, put the fennel slices into a bowl, and cover with water. Set your timer for 30 mins 
| Once the pork is done, take it out of the oven. Take it off the veggies, and set them aside on kitchen paper. Carefully take the crackling off the pork, and cut it into four quarters. Shred the rest of the pork. Drain the fennel
===Serving suggestions===
Place a neat heap of coleslaw in the centre of each plate. Scatter some fennel slices around it, and arrange some potato halves too, if you fancy using them. Put a neat heap of shredded pork on top of the coleslaw. Place a piece of crackling on top, put a couple of little heaps of pickled apples around too, garnish with fennel leaves and serve
