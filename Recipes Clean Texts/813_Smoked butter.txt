===Description===

A very easy beginners' recipe for a handheld smoking gun and makes 2 types of butter.  Decide for yourself which one you would like to use as your standard smoked butter.

===Ingredients===

| 250g unsalted butter, divided into two 125g pieces, and roughly diced
| 1 teaspoon sherry vinegar
| Apple or oak smoking chips, briefly soaked in water

===Method===


| Place the butter in separate bowls.
| Add the sherry vinegar to one of the bowls.
| Beat the butter which is in the bowl without the vinegar, until soft.
| Repeat the operation for the butter containing the vinegar.
| Cover both bowls with cling film or an airtight lid.
'''For each bowl'''

| Prepare the smoking gun with the desired wood chips.
| Loosen up a little of the cling film, so that you have just enough room to insert the gun (you can use the tube if you like).
| Light the wood chips with a lighter or match (do NOT use a blow torch or gas lighter).
| Smoke for 15-20 seconds until the bowl is full of smoke.
| Remove the gun and seal the gap with the cling film.
| Leave for 10 minutes.
| Repeat the previous three steps several times (up to 8) until you have the desired smokiness.
| If not using immediately, remove the butters from the bowls, shape and wrap in cling film, or place in containers and keep refrigerated.
===Serving suggestions===
Melt on meat or vegetables.  Also excellent with anything cooked on a barbecue.
===Variations===
Play about with different flavours of wood chips.  You can also add things to the butter, such as herbs, spices or citrus rind.
===Chef's notes===
Delicious, with or without the sherry vinegar!
