Rocket goes well with mackerel

===Description===


As Smoked mackerel salad with grapefruit with pasta is Anne's favourite recipe of all time, I thought it would try a variation using new potatoes instead of pasta.  It was an absolute success, the grapefruit pairs so well with the mackerel, cutting through what can a rather oily fish.

This recipe is very similar to a basic South American ceviche.

===Ingredients===
| 320 g (11 oz) peppered or plain, ready-to-eat smoked mackerel fillets, skinned and flaked
| 380 g 85 g (13.5 oz) cooked new potatoes, skin on, chopped into bite-sized pieces
| 1 small grapefruit
| 1 100 g (3 Â½ oz) pack prepared salad leaves
'''For the herb dressing'''
* 2 tablespoons olive oil
* 1 tablespoon clear honey
* 1 tablespoon white wine vinegar
* 1 tablespoon dark soy sauce
* A handful of spring onions, finely chopped on the diagonal or 1 small red or white onion, peeled and finely chopped 
* sea salt

===Method===


| Add the dressing ingredients to a large serving bowl
| Cut the skin from the grapefruit and discard
| Halve the  skinned grapefruit over the serving bowl and using your fingers, try to scoop the flesh from the grapefruit, leaving the membranes behind. Let all of the juice and separated flesh go into the bowl
| Whisk the ingredients well and check for seasoning
| Add the potatoes and flaked mackerel to the dressing ingredients and mix well
| Refrigerate for 30 minutes or more to allow the flavours to mingle
| Serve on a bed of salad leaves
