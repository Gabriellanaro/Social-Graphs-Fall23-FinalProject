Such a nice contrast

The sharp of the grapefruit tempers the richness of the fish - fabulous.
 

The Judge 

After a night of gluttony and another one planned tomorrow, I thought some healthy restraint was in order. This tasty, simple to prepare salad fits the bill perfectly.

This recipe is very similar to a basic South American ceviche.

===Ingredients===
| 200 g (7 oz) peppered or plain, ready-to-eat smoked mackerel fillets, skinned and chopped roughly
| 100 g (3.5 oz) cooked peeled prawns
| 85 g (3½ oz) dried pasta of choice, cooked, drained and cooled
| 1 small pink grapefruit, peeled and segmented
| 1 100 g (3 ½ oz) pack prepared salad leaves
'''For the herb dressing'''
* 2 tablespoons olive oil
* 1 tablespoon clear honey
* 1 tablespoon cider vinegar
* 2 spring onions, finely chopped on the diagonal
* 2 tablespoons fresh chives, chopped

===Method===


| Place the dressing ingredients into a screw-topped jar and shake well.
| In a large bowl add the fish, pasta, grapefruit. Pour over the dressing and mix well.
| Transfer to a serving dish and refrigerate for 30 minutes.
| Mix in the salad leaves and serve.
===Chef's notes===
Don't be tempted to add salt as processed mackerel can be quite salty already.
