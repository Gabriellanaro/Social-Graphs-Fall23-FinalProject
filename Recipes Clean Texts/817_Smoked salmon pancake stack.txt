===Description===

[[Image:Building the smoked salmon pancake stack.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Building the smoked salmon pancake stack]]
This simple meal served with New York slaw and tomatoes made an unusual and refreshing change.  Cut into small slices, this would also make a good starter. I Will definitely make this again.
===Ingredients===

====pancake mixture====
===Ingredients===NB
| 200 ml (7fl oz) milk mixed with 75 ml (3fl oz) cold water
| 2 free range eggs
| 110 g (4 oz) plain flour, sifted
| 50 g (2 oz) butter
| pinch of table salt
| Butter for frying
====filling====
===Ingredients===NB
| 180 g thinly sliced smoked salmon
| Fresh dill, finely chopped
| Lemon juice
===Mise en place===

* Chop the dill and separate the salmon into smaller pieces before you star in order to build the layers quickly.
* Warm a plate on which to build the stack of pancakes

===Method===


| Add the milk, water, eggs, flour and salt to a blender and mix until smooth.
| Remove any stalks from the dill and finely chop the leaves
| Separate the salmon into much smaller pieces
| Using 2 frying pans ensures you can build the stack quickly, but one will do.
| Heat Â¼ tablespoons of butter in a hot frying pan, pour a few tablespoons of batter into the middle of the pan and quickly swirl the pan to distribute evenly.
| Fry for about 30 seconds or until the underside is browned.
| Flip and cook the other side.
| Pop the pancake on a warm plate, top with sliced salmon, chopped dill and a sprinkle of lemon juice.
| Keep adding pancakes in this manner until the batter mix is used up.
| This amount of batter makes from 6 to 8 pancakes.
===Serving suggestions===
Chop the stack of pancakes in half, or smaller and serve with a cole slaw and fresh tomatoes.
