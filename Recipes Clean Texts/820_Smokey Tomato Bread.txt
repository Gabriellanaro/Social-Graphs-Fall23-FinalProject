===Description===

This is a white loaf made with tomato juice and hot smoked paprika.

===Ingredients===
| 425g ripe tomatoes, pureed and sieved- this should yield about 290g of juice
| 15g fresh yeast
| 500g strong white bread flour, sifted
| ¾ teaspoon salt
| 30g Piment\u00f3n de la Vera (picante)
| 1 tablespoon dried oregano
| ½ tablespoons dried mixed herbs
| 40g onion powder
| Pinch of sugar
| 1 tablespoon tomato pur\u00e9e
| 15g olive oil
===Method===


| Dissolve the yeast in the tomato juice.
| Meanwhile, mix the dry ingredients.
| When the yeast has dissolved mix it in with the flour and add the tomatoe pur\u00e9e and the olive oil. 
| Leave to rest for 10 minutes.
| Lightly flour a work surface and your hands and knead the dough for about 10 minutes until smooth and elastic. Don't worry about the dough sticking to your hands as it will become less moist as you work it.
| Shape into a ball, place in an oiled bowl and cover with clingfilm.
| Leave until the dough has almost doubled in size (about an hour).
| Gently knock back with your finger tips and repeat steps 6 and 7, but the proving should only take about 45 minutes.
| Gently knock back again, face downards into a rectangle, one side being the same length as the tin.
| Roll the dough towards you as tightly as you can.
| Flatten and stretch the ends and tuck them underneath so that they meet up in the middle.
| Place into a 900g / 2lb loaf tin, cover with clingfilm and prove until the dough reaches the top of the tin.
| Make some diagonal slashes across the top or one long one across the lenghth and bake at 220\u00b0 C (425\u00b0 F - gas 7), [fan oven 200\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour] for 30-35 minutes until baked.
| Cool completely on a wire rack.
===Serving suggestions===
Good with cheese.
===Variations===
Vary the herbs or you could use a sweet smoked paprika - Piment\u00f3n de la Vera (dulce).
===Chef's notes===
The loaf looks burnt but isn't.  It is just where the onion powder has caramelised.  The same would also happen if you used garlic powder.  I have a friend who goes to Barbados regularly who brings back onion powder for me as I have never seen it in our part of the UK.  I would suggest you try a good Asian or Caribbean grocer's shop.
