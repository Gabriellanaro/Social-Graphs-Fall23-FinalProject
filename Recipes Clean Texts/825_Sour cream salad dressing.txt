I made this with some leftover sour cream and it was delicious.  I used it in a much larger quantity that I would with a normal salad dressing.  It went really well with big crunchy lettuce leaves

| 1 tablespoon olive oil
| 2 tablespoons cold water
| 1 tablespoon white wine vinegar
| Pinch sea salt
| Pinch freshly ground black pepper
| Pinch of sugar

Pour over a leafy salad and serve immediately.
