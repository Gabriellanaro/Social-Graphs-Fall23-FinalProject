===Description===

Our local butchers, Russell's Butchers of Upwell, Norfolk, make their own Treacle Cured Back Bacon, nice, thick fatty back bacon with a huge hit of treacle and molasses.  They also produce fabulous duck breasts.  I thought a combination of the two, with the addition of a few extra flavours might be nice.

The results were fantastic, despite the long cooking time and the relatively high cooking temperature the duck was soft and tender and full of flavour.
===Ingredients===

| 1 large duck breast, skin on
| 1 thick slice of Treacle Cured Back Bacon
| 4 whole star anise
| 5 szechuan peppercorns, crushed
| 5 black peppercorns, crushed
| Â½ a large orange, cut into thick slicers, skin left on

===Method===


| Roll the duck breast in the mixture of ground peppercorns
| Place the bacon on the fleshy side of the duck breast
| Cover the bacon with the orange slices
| Place in a sous-vice vacuum bag
| Scatter the star anise over the oranges
| Vacuum seal and cook in a sous-vide bath for 10 hours at 82\u00b0C (179.6\u00b0F)
| Drain the fat and discard the star-anise
| If you wish you can crisp up the skin (and the bacon) by searing in a hot pan, skin-side down in a hot pan for 4 minutes
| Slice thinly before serving

===Serving suggestion===
Serve with curly fries and a selection of vegetables
===Variations===
If you can't get hold of treacly bacon, use thick fatty back bacon and a teaspoon of black treacle
===Chef's notes===
I would normally advise cooking a sous-vide duck breast for only 4 hours at a much lower temperature so the result is medium-rare, however to distribute the duck fat within th emeat and to spread the flavours, my experiments have show a higher temperature for longer, produces much nicer results.
