===Description===

Nick Lumby, founder and proprietor of Taste Sensation Ltd (my chosen supplier for herbs, spices and rubs), sometimes sends me taster samples of his upcoming products when I place an order with him. As the Taste Sensation Philly cheesesteak seasoning is not currently on [https://tastesensationltd.com/shop the Taste Sensation website] or on [https://www.amazon.co.uk/s?i=merchant-items&me=A3AGJ26L1FKXJR the list of his products available from Amazon UK], I have to assume it's a new product line.

I've decided to use this spice mix by cooking the rib-eye steaksous-vide, as apart from barbecuing, I think it is the best way to bring out the flavours of the meat. It also keeps it nice and moist.

If you are '''not''' going to cook the meat sous-vide, leave the steaks covered in the rub for at least a few hours at room temperature before cooking.
===Ingredients===

| 2 x 225g Aldi 21 day matured Rib-eye steaks from Ashfield Farms
| 2 tablespoons Taste Sensation Philly Cheesesteak seasoning

===Method===


| Shake about 3 tablespoons of the Taste Sensation Philly Cheesesteak seasoning evenly on to a dinner plate
| Press the steaks onto the rub and ensure they are evenly and well coated
| Add both of the rib-eye steaks to one sous-vide vacuum bag
| Vacuum seal and cook in the sous-vide bath at 68\u00b0C for 4 hours
| Remove the bag and serve immediately

===Serving suggestions===
Serve with chips, and vegetables of your choice.

===Chef's notes===
I originally cooked the steaks at 64\u00b0C for 3 hours; they were very nice but not done well enough for the interconnecting tissues to break down so I have increased the temperature and cooking time slightly.
Nice seasoning mix.
