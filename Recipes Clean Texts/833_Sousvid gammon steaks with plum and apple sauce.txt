===Description===

Bramblebee Farms do the most fantastic gammon steaks which in all honesty, don't need to be cooked with any flavourings, unlike some of the saltier supermarket cuts, but I do like experimenting with my cooking!
===Ingredients===

| 2 x medium sized gammon steaks
| 200 ml home-made apple sauce
| 3 tablespoons plum sauce - Chinese supermarkets have the best range of these
| 2 tablespoons lemon juice

===Method===


| Add all of the ingredients to a sous-vide vacuum bag and seal
| Cook in a sous-vide bath for 65\u00b0C for 6 hours
| Reserve the cooking juices and use to make up a gravy
| A few tablespoons of gravy granules and a minute or so in the moicrowave made a fabulous gravy
| Heat a griddleplate or grill pan on very high and caramelise the steaks for a minute or so

===Serving suggestions===
Serve with roast potatoes, vegetables of your choice and use the cooking juices as a rich gravy.
