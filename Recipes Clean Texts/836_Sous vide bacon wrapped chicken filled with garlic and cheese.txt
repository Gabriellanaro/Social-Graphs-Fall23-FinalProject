The flavours in this are immense, especially if you love garlic; and who doesn't? :-)

===Description===

Anne made Cheese stuffed pancetta chicken breasts for me last year and I tried a sous vide version , Sous vide prosciutto wrapped chicken stuffed with garlicky parsley butter which was a bit of a failure.

This is a bacon version and was a fabulous success.

Once the chicken has been cooked surrounded by the bacon, the bacon clings tightly to the chicken allowing it to be finished by pan frying.

Take care to choose 2 equal sized chicken breasts if you are buying them pre-packaged.  Mine were obscured by the label, resulting in one huge piece and one rather small.
===Ingredients===

| 2 chicken breasts of equal size
| 8 rashers of smoked streaky bacon - fatty bacon is the trick to keeping the chicken moist.
| 5 cloves of garlic, peeled and crushed
| 1 tablespoon of butter
| 2 slices of your favourite cheese. I used a smoked cheese which went rather well
| A pinch of mixed herbs
| Pinch of sea salt and freshly ground black pepper

===Method===


| Carefully cut a pocket into each chicken breast
| Mix the butter, crushed garlic, herbs, salt and pepper into a paste, divide it in two and fill the pockets with the mixture
| Add the cheese slices
| Roll the chicken up in the bacon
| Pop each chicken breast into its own sous vide bag and vacuum seal
| Cook in a sous vide bath heated to 64\u00b0 C (147\u00b0 F) for 2 hours
| Remove from the bag, reserving any juice to make gravy.
| Pan fry in a hot pan for 3 or 4 minutes until golden brown,
