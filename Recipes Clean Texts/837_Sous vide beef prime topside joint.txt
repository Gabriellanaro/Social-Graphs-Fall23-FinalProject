===Description===

An experiment at sous vide cooking a beef roasting joint to rare/medium rare. This is being cooked for a friend for looking after our boys - Meow!

Cook sous vide for 10 hours at 57\u00b0C (''134.6\u00b0F'')

===Ingredients===

| 625 g prime topside - The underside had a layer of fat which I left intact after much work with the tenderiser.
| 4 spring onions
| Bunch of sage
| 2 bay leaves
| Bunch of thyme
| 1 tablespoon English mustard
| Pinch of salt and black pepper

===Method===


| Stamp the join all over with a meat tenderiser
| Seal one end of a vacuum bag
| Add a pinch of salt and pepper
| Paint the joint with 1 tablespoon of English mustard
| Add the joint to the bag, hold it closed and shake it to distribute the salt and pepper
| Arrange the spring onions and herbs equally around the joint
| Vacuum seal
| Cook sous vide for 10 hours at 57\u00b0C (''134.6\u00b0F'')
| After 10 hours, open the bag and discard everything but the beef, you might have to pick some of the twiggy bits out as they can get 'buried'
| Seal the joint for 2 minutes in a very hot pan that is lightly oiled, blowtorch can also be used
| Serve immediately, or refrigerate and store for cold sliced beef
