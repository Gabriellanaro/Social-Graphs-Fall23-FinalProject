===Description===



This was a sous vide experiment to see if I could make chicken liver pate with the absolute minimum of effort.  This was really easy to make and was a great success, so much so I used it as stuffing for Sous vide fillet steak with chicken liver pate.

This is a great 'template' for many versions of pate. The temperature and cooking times are work well enough to cook all of the ingredients to the desired consistency, just and mess about with ingredients of your choice.

===Ingredients===

| 300g chicken livers
| 100g lardons
| 3 spring onions, finely chopped
| 4 cloves of garlic, peeled and crushed
| 1 tablespoon brandy
| 2 tablespoons port
| Good pinch of salt and pepper
| 3 tablespoons of butter

===Method===

| Remove the white centres of the livers and any connective tissues and roughly chop them.
| Mix all of the ingredients together.
| Seal one end of a vacuum pack bag and add the pate mix.
| Vacuum seal the bag
| Cook in a sous vide bath for 8 hours at 70\u00b0C (''158\u00b0F'')
| As soon as the pate is cooked, melt the butter over a gentle heat.
| Pack the pate into a ramekin dish and pour the melted  butter over the top.
| Store in the refrigerator.
