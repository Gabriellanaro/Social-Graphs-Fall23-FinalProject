Probably overkill!

Works fine, but probably easier done in a pan.

===Description===

This recipe would probably work just as well in a slow cooker, but as I've cracked my crockpot, sous vide it is.

I browned the sausages first just so they have a little colour.  Cooked at 71\u00b0C (''159.8\u00b0F''), the lentils would still not be properly cooked so I boiled them for 10 minutes first.  Different lentils may need longer cooking.

I've used Debbie & Andrew's Cumberland sausages, but any good quality would do.

I found the Heinz onion soup to be too sweet for my test so I would try an alternative next time.  A total success nonetheless.
===Ingredients===

| 1 pack (6) Debbie and Andrew's Butcher's Classic Cumberland Sausages
| 140 g dried red lentils
| 1 small red onion, peeled and finely chopped
| 4 cloves of garlic, peeled, smashed and chopped
| Pinch of freshly ground black pepper
| 1 can French Onion soup
===Mise en place===

* Pop the sous vide bath on to preheat to 71\u00b0C (''159.8\u00b0F'')

===Method===


| Rinse the lentils in cold running water then boil for 10 minutes, skim and discard any scum. , test them before bagging up as they won't get much softer being cooked sous-vide.
| Drain them in a sieve.
| Toss the sausages, onion and garlic in a hot pan just enough to colour the sausages. Don't let them begin to cook through. 
| Sprinkle with black pepper and add to a sous vide bag
| Add the onion soup and lentils to the bag and vacuum seal. If using the Andrew James Professional Quality Vacuum Food Sealer Machine: Vacuum seal, then cancel, then manually seal, allows you to vacuum seal a liquid without drawing it all into the vacuum chamber.
| Cook in a sous vide bath for 8 hours at 71\u00b0C (''159.8\u00b0F'')
