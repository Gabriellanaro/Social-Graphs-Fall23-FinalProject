Delicious and not as hard to make as I thought it would be.  Always glad of ideas to use my sous-vide cooker.

===Method===


| With a sharp knife, carefully make a pocket in each of the fillets buy cutting into the side of the steaks.
| Stamp each steak with a meat tenderiser to ensure a really tender steak.  Pay special attention to areas where there are membranes.
| Pop a tablespoon and a half of pate into each steak.
| Close the pockets and press the steaks flat.
| Add a teaspoons of butter on the top of each steak.
| Put each steak into its own vacuum pack bag and vacuum seal.
| Cook the steaks in the sous vide bath set to a temperature to match your preferred doneness. ''see Chef's notes''
===Serving suggestions===
These go well with anything but as a nod the The Chinese New Year I'm serving these with special fried rice
===Chef's notes===
Obviously two steaks cannot easily be cooked to different levels of doneness as this is determined by the temperature of the sous vide bath, not by the cooking time, although I've found that an extended cooking time tenderises the meat more.

I've also found that a well done steak cooked sous vide has the same juiciness and mouth feel of a normally cooked rare steak.  If you require rare and well done steaks, I would cook them both to medium [60\u00b0C for 2 hours].  You won't get any complaints!
