 The Judge 
===Description===

We got these venison medallions from V. J. Game - Sussex Smokers on their first visit to Hall Place Farmers' Market, Bexley, Kent.

I thought they might be nice, simply cooked sous vide in just salt, pepper, butter and a bay leaf.

From the experiments I have done when sous vide cooking, I've found if the temperature is kept relatively low the cooking period does not seem to be so important.  In fact, I would say that the longer it is cooked, the more tender the meat.  Rather like slow cooking, the extended cooking time helps to break down the collagens into a nice sauce.

Because the meat is vacuum sealed, the meat is never dry, even after 3 hours of cooking.

Compared to normal meat cooking when a rare steak can be bloody and not tender, even meat cooked sous vide to medium well done still has the moisture and mouthfeel of a rare steak, but without the blood. I'm going for 58.5\u00b0C for 3 hours.
===Ingredients===
===Ingredients===

| 2 venison (deer) medallions - about 140 g each
| 2 bay leaves
| 2 tablespoons of butter
| Salt and freshly ground black pepper

===Method===


| Stamp the medallions with a meat tenderiser if you have one.
| Pat the medallions dry, dress with a pinch of salt and freshly ground black  pepper, add a knob of butter and a bay leaf and then vacuum seal.
| Cook in a sous vide bath at 56.5\u00b0C (''133.7\u00b0F'') for 3 hours
| Remove from the vacuum pouch, reserving the juices to add to the gravy.  I used them to make a mushroom sauce.
| Sear in a hot pan to finish, ideally with a blowtorch.
| Serve immediately.  (Unlike conventionally cooked meat, I've never found a benefit to resting meat cooked sous vide)

===Chef's note===
The medallions were moist and had a really tender mouthfeel, taste and texture almost like liver.  Very nice.

I'm sure some cuts of venison may take a lot longer to cook, but these were selected cuts and very tender to start with.
