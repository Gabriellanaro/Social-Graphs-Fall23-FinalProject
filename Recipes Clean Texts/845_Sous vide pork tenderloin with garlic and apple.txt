===Description===

This is an aide-memoir for me so I can repeat this delicious dish.
[[Image:Sous vide pork tenderloin with garlic and apple recipe.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Vacuum sealed, ready for the sous-vide bath]]

I bought the pork tenderloin to make this dish, but then used a mixture of odds and ends to add as flavouring while the pork cooked.  Once cooked, the cooking juices were reserved for adding to gravy, all of the additional items were discarded.

If you have a sous-vide bath then use it as a guide and add ingredients of your choosing.  Great for using up odd left-overs.
===Ingredients===

| 1 Whole pork tenderloin fillet (about 400 g)
==== additional items added for flavouring====
===Ingredients===NB
| 4 cloves of garlic, peeled and crushed
| 2 tablespoons home-made apple sauce
| 10 fresh sage leaves
| 3 whole spring onions
| 2 medium tomatoes, chopped
| Pinch of black pepper
| 1 tablespoon calvados

===Method===


| Add all of the ingredients to a vacuum bag and squish them up so they mix well.
| Vacuum seal the bag
| Cook in a sous-vide bath for 6 hours at 65\u00b0 C
| Cut the corner off the bag and drain juices to make gravy
| Open the bag and remove the tenderloin.  Ensure you remove any odd sage leaves etc.
| Cut into medallions.
===Serving suggestions===
Serve with gravy made from the juices, roast potatoes and broccoli.
===Variations===
Cheat with the gravy:  Use gravy granules and use the broccoli water mixed with the cooking juices as the liquid.  Mix well and microwave for a few minutes to heat up.
