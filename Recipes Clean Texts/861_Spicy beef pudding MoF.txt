===Description===

\"Housekeeping's most important secret nowadays is to know how to make best use of the foods available.  Here are some practical suggestions for improving your inside knowledge without undue expense.\"  '''Ministry of food Cookery Calendar - April..May 1951'''

'''Filling:'''
===Ingredients===
| 1 oz dripping
| 2 level teaspoons sugar
| 10 oz stewing beef, cut in 1\" pieces
| 8 oz onion, sliced
| 1/8 level teaspoons black pepper
| 2 level teaspoons salt
| ½ level teaspoons ground ginger
| 1 clove
| 1 pint water
| 2 oz dried peas, soaked and cooked
'''Savoury suet pastry:'''
===Ingredients===NB
| 6 oz plain flour
| 1/8 level teaspoons dried sage
| 1/8 levels teaspoons dried thyme
| 1 level teaspoons salt
| 1 small onion, finely grated
| 3 oz shredded suet
| Approx. ¼ pint water to mix
===Method===


| Heat the dripping in a heavy saucepan, add the sugar and stir over a moderate heat until the sugar caramelises
| Add the meat and fry until it is a good brown colour, then add the onions and cook for 5 minutes
| Add the seasoning, spices and water and cook gently until the meat is tender
| Line a greased basin (1.5 pint size) with thirds of pastry and put alternate layers of spicy beef and peas into this, keeping back sufficient gravy for serving 
| Cover with remaining pastry, cover the basin with greased paper and steam for 1 ¼ - 1 ½ hours
| Serve hot
===Shelf life===

I have found that packet suet has a limited shelf life once opened. I thought I was unable to make decent dumplings until I threw out what turned out to be rancid suet and made them with a fresh packet!
