===Description===

Whilst this is often eaten at Christmas, it can (and should) be made all year round as it is excellent when cold and sliced for sandwiches or salads.  It is also a cheap cut of beef which is improved by long cooking at a low temperature.  This recipe produces a medium-rare meat.

===Method===


| Preheat the water bath to 56.5\u00b0C (''133.7\u00b0F'').
| Meanwhile remove the brisket from the brine and pat dry with kitchen paper.
| Rub the sugar and the ground spices all over the meat.
| Place in a vacuum pouch and evenly distribute the whole spices over the meat.
| Seal the pouch and cook in the water bath for 24-30 hours.
| Remove from the pouch and brush off the spices and sugar.
| Pat dry.
| Sear the meat in a smoking frying pan for 1-2 minutes on each side or a blowtorch to brown both side.
| Allow to cool before slicing.
===Variations===
Cook at 49\u00b0C (''120.2\u00b0F'') for rare meat, 60\u00b0C (''140\u00b0F'') for medium, 65.5\u00b0C (''149.9\u00b0F'') for medium well or 71\u00b0C (''159.8\u00b0F'') for well done.

This can, of course, be served as a joint as part of a hot meal.
===Chef's notes===
You can use your own favourite spice mix, but if using whole spices, ensure they are not hard and jagged or you might pierce the vacuum pouch.
