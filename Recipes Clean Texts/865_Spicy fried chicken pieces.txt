===Description===

I made this as a little experiment and it went down so well with everyone that I've decided to add it as a recipe.

This recipe is fairly healthy as it does not need to be deep-fried.  I've used olive oil but you could use any vegetable oil.  If you do use olive oil, as its smoke point is much lower that most frying oils, so keep the temperature lower than you normally would, or put the smoke alarm in the garden!

Although the preparation time is shown as 4 hours, you could sacrifice the marination period if you were short on time.

I've used Tex-Mex mix for the seasoning, but in place of that you could just add a pinch of chilli powder and any powdered spices that you fancy.

===Ingredients===

| 2 large chicken breasts, chopped into thumb-sized pieces
| 1 tablespoon lime juice
| Â¼ teaspoon salt for the marinade
| 1 teaspoon taco-mix for the marinade
| 1 large clove of garlic, peeled and crushed
| 1 egg, beaten
| 2 tablespoons fine cornmeal
| 5 tablespoons plain flour
| 1 tablespoon taco-mix for the 'batter'
| Enough olive oil to fill the base of a wok by 1.3cm (1/2\")
===Mise en place===

* Add the chicken pieces, salt, taco-mix, lime juice and crushed garlic to a Lock and Lock box, replace the lid, shake very well and leave in the fridge for 3 or four hours to marinade, shaking now and then if you can.

===Method===


| Heat the olive oil in a wok or frying pan.  Not too hot that it smokes.
| Add the taco-mix (or your desired spices) to a bowl containing the plain flour and mix well.
| When you are ready to fry the chicken, add two tablespoons of cornmeal to the chicken pieces and shake really well to coat the chicken evenly.
| Beat the egg and add to a bowl.
| Dip each pice of chicken in the beaten egg, then coat coat with the spicy flour mix, then carefully add to the hot oil.  Do this in two batches so you don't overwhelm the oil and kill the temperature.
| Fry for about 2 to 3 minutes, turning often.
| Remove the cooked chicken with a slotted spoon and allow to drain on kitchen paper.
| Check the chicken is properly cooked, though it should be fine as the pieces are very small and turning them ensures an even heat.

Serve with a mixed salad
