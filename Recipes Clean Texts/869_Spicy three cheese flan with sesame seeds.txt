===Description===

A deliciously spicy quiche made with three cheeses, the pastry is flavoured with curry powder and the quiche is topped with sesame seeds.  This makes a great accompaniment to a salad, any time of year.

===Ingredients===

| 60 ml olive oil (about 4 tablespoons)
| 1 large onion, peeled and chopped
| 2 cloves of garlic, peeled and crushed
| 50 g blue cheese
| 225 g cream cheese
| 1 tablespoon plain flour
| 3 eggs, whites and yolks separated
| sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
| 3 tablespoons chives, finely chopped
| 225 g pre rolled shortcrust pastry
| 50 g Cheddar cheese
| 4 pinches of curry powder
| Pinch of fine salt
| Pinch of freshly ground black pepper
| 2 tablespoons of sesame seeds
===Mise en place===
* If the pre rolled pastry has been refrigerated, remove from the fridge 30 minutes before you want to work with it.
* Preheat the oven to 200\u00b0 C (400\u00b0 F - gas 6), [fan oven 180\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]

===Method===


| Heat the oil in a frying pan or wok and add a good pinch of black pepper
| Saute the oil over a low heat until soft and transparent. Do not allow it to brown
| Add the crushed garlic and stir-fry for the last few minutes
| Remove from the heat and set aside and allow to cool
| Crumble the blue cheese into a bowl and mix in the cream cheese
| Stir in the flour, egg yolks, cooled cooked onions and garlic, chopped chives and season with a pinch of salt, not too much as the blue cheese is quite salty
| Using a 20 cm (8 inch) push out flan tin,  mark a circle that will fit snugly in the bottom
| Grease the inside of the flan case with a little olive oil or butter
| Sprinkle the grated Cheddar cheese over the prepared pastry and dust with the curry powder
| Use a rolling pin to press this into the pastry
| Line the base of the tin with the disc of pastry, cheese side up. Rolling this up first is the easiest way to transfer it to the fan tin. 
| To make the edge strip you will need to re roll the remaining pastry.  Using your hands, roll into a long sausage, about 60 cm long (2 feet) long, and then roll that out to match the height of your tin.
| Use this strip to line the edge of the tin, cheese side up.
| Crimp the two pieces of pastry together with your fingers so they make a good seal
| In another bowl, whisk the egg whites until they create still peaks and sprinkle with a little salt and pepper
| Gently fold the egg whites into the cheese mixture and spread evenly to fill the flan case
| Sprinkle with sesame seeds
| '''Bake in the middle of the oven for 30 minutes at 200\u00b0 C'''. Check it after 20 minutes and lower the heat to 180\u00b0 if it looks too browned.
