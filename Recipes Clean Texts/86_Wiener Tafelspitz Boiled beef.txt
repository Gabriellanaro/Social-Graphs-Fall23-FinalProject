===Description===

Boiled beef from Vienna - nicer than it sounds!

===Ingredients===
| 450 g beef bones
| 2 litres water
| Salt
| 900 g - 1.2 kg beef topside or silverside, tied
| 1 large leek, cut in half
| 1 large carrot, scraped and cut in half
| 2 sticks celery, chopped
| 1 onion, finely sliced
| 4 sprigs parsley
| 10 black peppercorns
===Method===


| Cover the bones in a large pan with the water to which a little salt has been added.
| Slowly bring to the boil, skimming the scum from the surface.
| Add the beef and the rest of the ingredients and slowly bring to the boil again.
| Reduce the heat so that the liquid is just about simmering.
| Partially cover and cook for 2Â½ to 3 hours, until the beef is very tender.
| Remove the beef from the pan, allow to rest slightly and when cool enough to handle cut into thick slices and serve on a warm dish.
===Serving suggestions===
Serve with fried potato chunks, spinach and grated apples or horseradish sauce.
===Chef's notes===
The secret to this dish is to allow the beef to cook very slowly.  Do not be tempted to rush it.
