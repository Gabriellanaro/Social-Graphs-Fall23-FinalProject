===Description===

It's Autumn, so it's time to dig out more squash recipes.

This would probably be better made with a butternut squash than my Harlequin F1 squashes which make are ''wetter'' when cooked than the butternut squash.  Anyway, I have about 25 of these, so Harlequin it is!

===Ingredients===
| 1 Harlequin squash (or any small squash or pumpkin weighing between 500 g and 700 g).
| Peel and dice the squash and discard the seeds
| 450 g potatoes, peeled and  diced.
| 200 g cabbage, shredded (woody parts removed) - Savoy is best, but any will do.
| 5 spring onions, trimmed and thinly chopped
| sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
| 2 tablespoons olive oil

===Method===


| Add the squash pieces to a pan of lightly salted boiling water and cook for 15 minutes.
| In another pan, boil the potatoes for 10 minutes, then add the cabbage and cook for a further 10 minutes or until the potatoes are just soft enough to mash.
| Drain the potatoes and cabbage really well.
| Drain the squash, if it is very watery, place in a sieve and press some of the water out with the back of a large spoon.
| Add the potatoes, squash to a large bowl, season with salt and pepper and mash together really well. Finally, mix in the spring onions.
| Heat 1 tablespoon of the oil in a large frying pan, add the mixture and pat down so it fills the pan. Cook for 10 minutes on a medium heat.
| Slide the bubble and squeak out onto a large plate, heat the remaining oil, return the bubble and squeak to the pan and fry the un-cooked side for another 10 minutes.
===Serving suggestions===
Cut into wedges and serve.
===Chef's notes===
For 2 people, freeze half and make a thinner tortilla.
