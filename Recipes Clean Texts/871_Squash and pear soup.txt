===Description===


With this flexible friend you can swap the ginger and walnuts for Parmesan and sage.

===Ingredients===

| 1 medium-sized squash or pumpkin
| 3 pears, peeled and diced
| 1 whole garlic bulb, 1 cm of top cut off to reveal the cloves
| sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
| A few rosemary or thyme sprigs (optional)
| A gloss of olive oil
| 500ml veg or chicken stock, warmed
| A dash of cream, mascarpone or cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche (optional)
| A small thumb of fresh ginger
| A handful of walnuts, toasted and chopped
===Mise en place===

* Heat your oven to 220\u00b0 C (425\u00b0 F - gas 7), [fan oven 200\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]

===Method===


| Carve the top off the squash/ pumpkin. Scoop out the seeds. Carve out the flesh inside. Scoop it out with a spoon.
|Roughly chop the flesh. Mix with the pear. Season. Toss on a baking tray, with the pumpkin/squash and garlic. Gloss with olive oil. Tuck in some rosemary/thyme sprigs. Roast for 1hr or till the pumpkin is golden and tender, check throughout cooking.
|Once tender, whizz the flesh with the stock, slowly trickling it in till it\u0092s as you like. Finish with a little cream, mascarpone or cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, if you like. Grate in some fresh ginger, to taste. Adjust salt/pepper levels, if needed.

===Serving suggestion===
* Serve with a little extra cream and the walnuts.
