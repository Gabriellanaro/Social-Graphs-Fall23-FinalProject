===Description===

'''Home-made Steak and kidney pudding recipe'''. Although this recipe takes 5 hours to cook, or burn, if you are forgetful, most of the time is in the boiling, the preparation is minimal, plus you have the benefit of the wonderful smell whilst it's cooking.

The pudding is known colloquially as \"Babby's Yead\" (Baby's Head) in certain areas of North West England.

'''The pressure cooker version of this recipe can be found here.'''

''' Suet crust'''
===Ingredients===
| 350 g( 12 oz) self-raising flour
| 175 g (6 oz) shredded beef suet (Atora)
| Pinch of sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
'''Filling'''
===Ingredients===NB
| 560 g (1¼ lb) chuck steak / braising steak
| 275 g (10 oz) ox kidney - trimmed to 225 g (8 oz), ''some supermarkets sell the above, ready trimmed, in one packet''
| 2 tablespoons plain flour
| Big pinch of mustard powder
| sea salt and freshly ground black pepper 
| Handful of fresh parsley, chopped
| 1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
| 1 Oxo cube, crumbled
| 1 medium onion, peeled and sliced
| ''You shouldn't need to add any water though you may want to make some gravy separately to serve with the pudding''. 
===Method===

'''Pastry'''

| You can do this in a food processor, but don't over-mix it
| Sift the flour, salt into a large mixing bowl
| Season with black pepper
| Add the suet, a few drops of water and combine with the flour, using a palette knife
| Continue stirring, adding a few drops of water at a time until it starts to become a little clay-like
| Stop adding water now and mix with your hands
| Keep mixing until you have a smooth elastic dough.  You can always make small adjustments by adding a little more flour or water as needed
| Divide the dough into ¼ for the lid and ¾ t line the bowl
| Roll out a circle, quite thick, about a foot in diameter and press into your pie-bowl
| Roll the remainder out as a lid so that it sits over the edges of the lined bowl
'''Filling'''

| Trim the meat and kidneys of excess fat etc. so you have the correct weight. Feed your cats or dogs with the remainder!
| Season the flour with salt, pepper and mustard
| Dredge the meat and kidney in the seasoned flour
| Add all of the filling ingredients to a separate bowl.  Crumble in the Oxo cube.  Mix well with your hands.
| Fill the suet-lined bowl with the filling ingredients.
| Shake any remaining flour over the top and ''just'' cover the meat with cold water
| Add a few shakes of Worcestershire sauce
| Season with salt and pepper

'''Wrapping and cooking'''

| Cover with a double layer of tin-foil, leaving a pleat for expansion
| Tie with kitchen string and make a handle affair if you are able.  It assists with removal later
| Fill a lidded pan ¾ full with boiling water and lower the bowl into it, cover and boil for 5 hours. Yes that's five hours!
| '''Set a timer for every hour''' so you can check that it's not boiled dry and top up if needed
| If using a pressure cooker, reduce the cooking time to about 2 hours, see full details in a separate recipe, here.
===Serving suggestions===
Serve with mashed potatoes and peas and gravy.

Don't try and invert a pudding of this size onto a plate. You are inviting disaster, and for no sensible reason. Trust me. Serve it directly out of the bowl!

===Chef's notes===
* Don't sit the bowl on a saucer in the pan.  It will probably be broken after 5 hours
* Next time, using this quantity, I would make 2 separate puddings
* Check the ''use-by'' date of the suet, I had a batch of suet-pudding failures, which I eventually traced to years out-of-date packet suet. It does go off.
* Suet can be frozen and keeps for ever this way.  Defrost naturally. 

===Variations===
I often make 2 separate puddings using this recipe. I make the first using half the cooked meat and freeze the remainder for the other pudding.
Always make the suet mix on the day you plan to cook the pudding. I use 200 g of plain flour and 100 g of suet for each of the smaller puddings.

Other variations can be found on the comments page.

After much experimenting, I have discovered the best knot to tie kitchen twine on your own is the ''Surgeons' knot''.
