 The Judge 
===Description===

Steak Diane was the height of fashion in grand dining rooms across America. The highpoint of the meal came when a waiter in jacket and bow-tie flamed a diner's sirloin table-side before his very eyes! There are a number of variations on Steak Diane, but most call for butter, shallots, mustard, cream, Worcestershire sauce, brandy, and a match.

The dish is said to be named for Diane, the Roman Goddess of hunting; many game dishes also use her name.

This classic 70's dinner party dish is definitely still worth making because it has the very best ingredients.  Probably needs a bottle of Blue Nun and a prawn cocktail too!

===Method===

'''Sauce'''

| In a saucepan, fry the onion and carrot in butter until golden
| Add the flour and stir to absorb any remaining butter
| Add the remaining sauce ingredients, bring to the boil and then simmer gently for 30 minutes, aiming to reduce by about half
| Strain the liquid through a colander so you keep some of the ''bits''
| Cover and set-aside for later
'''Steaks'''

| Heat the butter and fry the steaks until browned all over
| Pour the sherry and brandy over the steaks and light the vapours.  You could do this stage at the table if you wish.
| Cover, turn off the heat and let the steaks rest for 10 minutes
| Add the reserved sauce and Worcestershire sauce to the frying pan, bring to the boil, sprinkle with chopped 
parsley and serve
