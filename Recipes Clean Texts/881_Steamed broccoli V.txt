[[Image:Steamed broccoli cooking evenly.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Cut a cross in the stems to ensure everything cooks evenly]]
This is probably our favourite vegetable and steaming it is such an easy way to cook it. Allow  3 to 4 minutes for crunchy, about 5 minutes to leave it slightly tender but still with a little bite.

===Ingredients===
| 1 small head of broccoli
| Cut the broccoli into evenly sized florets
===Method===


| Ensure the florets are all the same size.  
| Make a small cross cut down the base of any thick stems to ensure that they cook evenly.
| Place the broccoli in a steamer or a colander set over a pan of boiling water, cover and steam for 7 minutes.
| Serve immediately.
===Variations===
Mix 50/50 with cauliflower or carrots - cut into similar-sized pieces to ensure they are evenly.
