===Description===

monkfish is a superb firm white fish, with a taste similar to king prawns.  It is now widely available at a reasonable price.  If it has been filleted and deboned it can be used exactly like prawns, however it is often sold  sold on the bone as monkfish tail.  Removing the meat from the bone while the fish is raw can be tricky and wasteful. However, once cooked the meat just falls off.

The method below worked very well with a frozen monkfish tail, the dill gave it a really nice herbs flavour.

===Ingredients===

| 1 monkfish tail - frozen is fine
| 1 bunch of dill
| Pinch of sea salt

===Method===


| Make a bed of the dill in the steamer basket
| Sit the monkfish tail on the dill, sprinkle with sea salt and drop a few sprigs of dill over the top
| Add boiling water to the steamer and steam, covered for 15 minutes
| I cooked mine from frozen so after 15 minutes of steaming I took the pan off the heat and let it sit for 10 minutes.
| Once cooled a little the flesh just falls off the gelatinous bone.
===Serving suggestions===
I used the monkfish meat in Cheesy monkfish jacket potatoes - plenty for two people.
