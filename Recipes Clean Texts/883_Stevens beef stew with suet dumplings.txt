Nothing wrong with plain food.

 The Judge 
===Description===

This stew is based upon Bogr\u00e1csguly\u00e1s (Goulash), but without the spices.  This was requested by Steven, who is the boyfriend of my daughter and who likes plain food.

===Ingredients===
| 2 medium onions, roughly chopped
| 2 tablespoons lard or sunflower oil
| 1.1 kg stewing steak, cut into large cubes
| 2.8 litres warm beef stock 
| 750 g carrots, cut into large chunks
| 1 kg potatoes, peeled and quartered
| 1 small Savoy cabbage, coarsely shredded
| 1½ quantity of Chef's suet dumplings recipe
===Method===


| Preheat the lard to a medium temperature in large pan.
| Add the onions, and stew until glossy, but not brown.
| Add the beef cubes and cook for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.
| Remove from the heat, and add the warm beef stock.
| Cook, covered, over a medium heat for one hour.
| Increase the heat, remove the lid and add the carrots.
| Simmer for 20 minutes.
| Place the dumplings in the pan.
| Add the potatoes and bring to a gentle boil for 10 minutes.
| Add the cabbage and cook for a further 10 minutes.
===Serving suggestions===
Steve wanted this served with Pan con s\u00e9mola de trigo duro, which is an excellent bread.
===Chef's notes===
I made the stock using Kallo Organic beef cubes, but any decent beef stock would be fine.
