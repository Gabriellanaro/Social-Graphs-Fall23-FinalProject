===Description===

We've grown giant asparagus at home for many years.  This recipe is ideally suited to the home gardener who probably only has a few stems to deal with at a time, often not enough to use as a serving of vegetables.  This also works with slightly woody stems too. 

As the flavours are immense you only need a sprinkling of them to really lift a meal.

Slice them according to tenderness, the foot quite thin and the 'flower head' leave completely intact.
===Ingredients===
===Ingredients===

| 4 giant asparagus stems
| 3 cloves of garlic, peeled and crushed
| A pinch of black pepper
| A few tablespoons of olive oil
| 5ml dark soy sauce

===Method===


| Remove and discard the really woody part of the stems
| Slice the remaining on the diagonal, leaving the very tender heads in one piece
| Heat a frying pan or a wok and add about 4 tablespoons of water and the sliced stems and allow to cook in the steaming, bubbling water until it completely dries up
| Shimmy the pan to allow the asparagus to get a little seared
| To be on the safe side, you may need to let the pan cool a little before the next stage.
| With the asparagus still in the pan, add a few tablespoons of olive oil, a shake of black pepper and the crushed garlic and cook quite gently for 3 to 5 minutes to allow the flavours to mingle.  Don't let the garlic brown.
| Mix well and serve.
