===Description===

This is a simple mix of vegetables that is very adaptable.  Purple Majesty potatoes are available from branches of '''[http://www.sainsburys.co.uk/sol/index.jsp Sainsbury's].'''



===Ingredients===
| Â½ pack (about 600g) Purple Majesty potatoes
| 1 large carrot, peeled and cut into quarters lengthways
| 1 parsnip, peeled and cut into quarters lengthways
| 1 whole Fennel bulb, thinly sliced
| 1 large onion, peeled and thinly sliced
| 2 tablespoons sesame oil
| Handful of flat leaf parsley, chopped to garnish
| Freshly ground black pepper
| 50g smoked lean bacon cut into small pieces (See '''Variations''' below)
===Method===


| Peel and cut potatoes in half. 
| Place in a large, lidded pan and cover with cold water. 
| Bring to the boil then reduce the heat to medium and simmer for 15 minutes until tender but still holding shape. 
| Meanwhile, in a wide non-stick wok/frying pan, over a medium heat, fry the bacon pieces until starting to brown, then remove from the heat and set aside. 
| Next, add 2 tablespoons of sesame oil to the wok/frying pan and add the carrots and parsnip slices and saut\u00e9 over a high heat, stirring continuously for 5 mins.
| Now, add the sliced fennel, onion, a couple of tablespoons of water and season with black pepper, cover and cook over a medium heat for a further 15 minutes until the root vegetables are tender and the onion is transparent. 
| Finally, strain the cooked Purple Majesty potatoes and add those and the cooked bacon back into the vegetable mix. 
| Mix together and serve immediately with a sprinkling of fresh parsley on top.
===Serving suggestions===
Good with chicken or grilled fish.
