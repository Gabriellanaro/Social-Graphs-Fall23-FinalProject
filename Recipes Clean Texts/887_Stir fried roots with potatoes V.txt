| Freshly ground black pepper
===Method===


| Peel and cut potatoes in half. 
| Place in a large, lidded pan and cover with cold water. 
| Bring to the boil then reduce the heat to medium and simmer for 15 minutes until tender but still holding shape. 
| Next, add 2 tablespoons of sesame oil to the wok/frying pan and add the carrots and parsnip slices and saut\u00e9 over a high heat, stirring continuously for 5 mins.
| Now, add the sliced fennel, onion, a couple of tablespoons of water and season with black pepper, cover and cook over a medium heat for a further 15 minutes until the root vegetables are tender and the onion is transparent.
