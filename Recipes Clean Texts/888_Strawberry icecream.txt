===Description===

I've been experimenting with many ice-cream recipes for a forthcoming dinner party and I'm convinced this one is the winner.

I'm not a great fan of sickly sweet ice-cream, this recipe is more like a creamy sorbet.  I think this is a nicer way to make an ice cream to suit everyones tastes.  Squeezy chocolate sauce, honey or golden syrup can be drizzled over the ice-cream for those sweeter of tooth.

The maximum volume of my ice-cream maker ''Cuisinart Professional ice cream maker'' is 1.5 litres, which seems to fairly common.  This recipe makes more than this, but any leftover ice cream can be popped into a Lock and Lock box and frozen immediately.  Just remove it from the freezer an hour before you want to serve it.

===Ingredients===

| 460 g fresh strawberries
| 600 ml single cream
| 500 ml Greek yogurt
| 40 ml freshly squeezed lemon juice
| 100 g caster sugar
| Scant ½ teaspoon of vanilla extract

===Method===


| Remove the stems (''peduncle'') from the strawberries and trim and discard any white unripe parts.
| Add the strawberries and the remaining ingredients to a food processor with a metal blade and blend to your desired consistency.
| Pour unto your ice-cream maker and follow your manufacturer's instructions. For mine it's just needs to run for one hour.
| Pour any leftover mixture into a Lock and Lock style box and freeze.
===Chef's notes===
To my palate, this tastes like a creamy sorbet as it has a fresh lemony tang.
