This recipe is reproduced courtesy of debbie&andrew's sausages.
===Ingredients===

| 2 red bell peppers
| Olive oil 
| 4 Debbie and Andrew's Caramelised Red Onion Pork Sausages, removed from their casings
| 1 medium courgette, grated
| 1 tablespoon sultanas [optional]
| Zest of half a lemon
| 1 tablespoon finely sliced coriander leaf
| 1 tablespoon pine nuts, toasted
====dressing====
===Ingredients===NB
| 25g coriander leaf 
| 1 clove of garlic, minced 
| 3 tablespoons olive oil
| 1 tablespoon lemon juice
| 1 tablespoon water
| \u00bd teaspoon salt
===Mise en place===

*  Pre-heat oven to 180\u00b0C (fan-setting).

===Method===


| Split the peppers in half down the middle (through the stalk), remove all of the seeds and fibrous flesh and lay cut side up over a teaspoon of olive oil in an oven dish, roast for 15 minutes.
| In a frying pan, fry the sausage meat in a teaspoon of olive oil. After three minutes, add the grated courgette to the pan, stir and continue to cook until the sausage meat is fully browned - 6-7 minutes in total.
| Remove the filling from the pan, and drain in a sieve. Use a spoon to push out any excess liquid (a mix of sausage fat and water from the courgettes). Add the sultanas if using, plus the lemon zest and coriander. Stir well.
| Remove the peppers from the oven. Stuff with all of the filling and roast in the oven for a final 25 minutes.
| Meanwhile make the salsa. In a small food processor, blend the coriander with the rest of the ingredients, till a chunky paste forms.
| When the peppers are ready, remove from the oven and drizzle with salsa and toasted pine nuts. Serve with green salad.
===Chef's notes===
Instead of peppers you could stuff aubergines or courgettes.
