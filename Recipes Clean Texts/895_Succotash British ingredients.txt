===Description===

==Succotash using British ingredients==
The version of succotash is based on Lyn Hall's 'My succotash' [Lyn Hall's Cookery Course ISBN 1840913487] which uses ingredients that would be available in the UK.  I am making it to go with Tex-Mex beer can chicken as I feel they would work well together.

===Ingredients===
| 450 g canned sweetcorn
| 300 ml vegetable stock
| 60 g dried couscous
| 50 g butter
| 1 teaspoon chilli flakes
| 100g spring onions, sliced on the diagonal
| 3 sweet peppers, roasted, de-seeded and sliced.  A mix of colours is good.
| 400g borlotti beans
| 1 cup defrosted garden peas
| Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
===Method===


| Place the couscous in a small bowl, boil the stock and pour about ¾ of it over the couscous. Leave for 15 minutes then fluff with a fork.
| Rinse the sweetcorn and beans under running cold water.
| Heat the butter in a large frying pan or wok, add the chilli flakes, a grind of pepper and the chopped spring onions and peppers and stir-fry for a 20 seconds and then add the sweetcorn, pulses and the remaining stock
| Bring to the boil, reduce and simmer until the stock has almost disappeared and the vegetables are heated, about 10 minutes.
| Add the couscous, mix well and serve hot.

===Variations===
I've used borlotti beans so there is a good colour mix, however almost any canned pulses would be fine.  I often open various cans of pulses, rinse them, mix them all up in a huge bowl and freeze in small batches.  A mix such as this would be ideal in this dish.
