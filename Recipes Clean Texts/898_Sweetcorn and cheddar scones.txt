===Description===

These savoury scones are packed full of summer sunshine. They go down with little ones, as well as adults. Serve as an alternative afternoon tea, in lunchboxes or alongside soup - perhaps, a rich, roasted red pepper soup. Mmm...

===Ingredients===

| 2 sweetcorn cobs
| 350g self-raising flour
| 1 teaspoon baking powder
| a pinch of finely chopped chilli (or chilli powder)
| 1tsp salt
| 50g cold butter, cut into cubes
| 150g grated cheddar, plus extra for tops
| 175ml milk, plus extra for brushing
===Mise en place===
Heat the oven to 200\u00b0 C (400\u00b0 F - gas 6), [fan oven 180\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]
===Method===


| Cut the kernels off the cobs, place in a pan, add enough water to just cover. Simmer 5 minutes. Drain well.
| Heat oven to 200\u00b0C/400\u00b0F/gas 6. Mix flour, baking powder, chilli and salt. Rub butter cube into the mix until it looks like fine crumbs. Add grated cheddar and the corn. Drizzle in the milk. Fold in to make a slightly sticky dough. Don't over-work.
|Gently knead on a floured surface until smooth. Divide into 10 balls. Shape each roughly with floured hands. Put onto an oiled baking sheet. Brush scones with a little milk. Scatter grated cheese over the top. Bake for 10-12 mins or until the scones are risen, golden and sound hollow when tapped on the bottom. 
===Serving suggestions===
Delicious with butter.
