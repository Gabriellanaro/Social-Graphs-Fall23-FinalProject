===Description===

I just threw this together.  I used 2 long chillies of the variety sold in Indian grocery chops and it was fairly hot.  This recipe is for making in a Thermomix but can easily be adapted for making in a saucepan and finishing off in a blender.

===Ingredients===TM
| 1 onion, peeled and thickly sliced
| Chillies, to taste
| 30g olive oil
| Pinch of sugar
| 500g frozen sweetcorn
| 300g water
| 250g single cream
| 2 teaspoons of vegetable bouillon powder
| Seasoning (if needed)
| Parsley, to garnish
===Method===


| Put the oil into the TM bowl 8 minutes / Temp. Varoma / Reverse Blade / Speed 1
| Add the onion slices and the sugar 15 minutes / Temp. Varoma / Reverse Blade / Speed Spoon / MC OFF
| Add the sweetcorn, water, cream and vegetable bouillon powder and cook '''15 minutes / 100\u00b0C / Speed 1 / MC On'''.
| Blend the soup '''1 minute / increasing from Speed Spoon to Speed 9'''.
| Serve garnished with some chopped parsley.
===Variations===
You can use yogurt instead of cream.
