Not that nasty packet stuff, this is Danish Mature Cheddar and it makes a great Covid Lockdown meal.

Experimenting with my sample of Taste Sensation Matured Blue Cheese powder.  It's not a cheese sauce, just a high quality Danish spray dried blue cheese, in a powdered form.

===Ingredients===

| 2 tablespoons olive oil
| 1 teaspoon taste sensation Italian seasoning
| 1 large red onion, peeled and sliced
| 2 cloves of garlic, peeled and crushed
| 120g chorizo slices, chopped
| 190g of pasta tubes
| 40g Taste Sensation Matured Blue Cheese powder
| 40g butter
| 30 g plan flour
| 400 ml semi-skimmed milk
| 1 heaped teaspoon dried parsley
| 2 slices of Maasdam cheese, torn
===Mise en place===

* Preheat your oven to 190\u00b0 C (375\u00b0 F - gas 5), [fan oven 170\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]

===Method===


| Add the Taste Sensation Matured Blue Cheese powder to a mixing bowl and gradually whisk in the milk, leave to rest while you prepare the onions
| Cook the pasta shells in plenty of boiling water for about 12 minuets, or until done to your liking
| Meanwhile add the olive oil to your frying pan and saute the chopped onions for 5 minutes
| Add the crushed garlic and saute for a few minutes
| Add the chopped chorizo
| Stir in the taste sensation Italian seasoning
| Drain the pasta and stir it onto the onion mix to prevent it sticking together
| For the blue cheese sauce, melt the butter in a saucepan and stir in the flour to make a roux
| Gradually whisk in about a third of the milk/cheese powder and add the dried parsley to the mixture and bring to a boil.  The moment it is boiling, stir in the rest and return to the boil.
| Tip the onion/pasta mix into a baking tray and spread it evenly
| Pour the sauce over the pasta and mix well
| Scatter the torn Maasdam cheese over the top and bake for 25 to 30 minutes.
===Serving suggestions===
Serve with fresh tomatoes
===Chef's notes===
You can use ground black pepper, salt and herbs of your choice as a substitute for the Taste Sensation Italian spice mix.
