These are lighter that they would have been with real cheese as that adds more fat.  Very tasty and you can see how fluffy they were in the stew.

===Description===

Normal dumpling made cheesy by adding a few tablespoons of Taste Sensation's lovely Mature Strong Cheese powder.
===Ingredients===

| 80 g Shredded suet at room temperature
| 160 g self raising flour
| A pinch of ascorbic acid (if available)
| 1 teaspoon dried parsley
| A few tablespoon water at room temperature
===Mise en place===

* Preheat your oven to 190\u00b0 C (375\u00b0 F - gas 5), [fan oven 170\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]
===Method===


| Add the parsley, Taste Sensation Well Matured Cheese Powder, shredded suet and self raining flour to a bowl
| Gently mix with a spoon to combine
| Using your fingers rub the flour into the suet until the flour is no longer 'floury'
| Add a little water at a time until you are able to form the mixture into balls, slightly smaller than ping-pong balls
| Leave to rest in a warm place until you're ready to bake them
| Add them to the top of a stew during the final 30 to 40 minutes of cooking at between 180 \u00b0 C to 200 \u00b0 C
