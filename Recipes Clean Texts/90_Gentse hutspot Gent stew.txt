===Description===

[[Image:Ghent stew - ingredients.jpg|300px|thumb|right|Gent stew, the ingredients]]
Beef and vegetable stew from Gent, which although uses cheap cuts of meat, has a cooking time of about 4 hours.

===Ingredients===
| 500 g boneless beef shank, in one piece
|* Stewing steak is fine for this if you cannot obtain shank.
| 250 g pigs trotters or ham hocks (optional)
| 125 g smoked, streaky bacon, in one piece
| 1 litre light beef stock or water
| 1 teaspoon salt
| Ground black pepper, to taste
| 2 bay leaves
| 4 cloves
| 3 medium carrots, peeled and diced
| 2 leeks, dark green parts removed, sliced
| 3 large sticks celery, diced
| Â½ medium white cabbage, shredded
| 4 medium potatoes, peeled and quartered
===Method===


| Put the meats, seasonings, bay leaves and cloves in a pan with the stock or water and bring to the boil.
| Skim, lower the heat, cover and simmer for about three hours.
| Add the carrots, leeks and celery and simmer for a further 30 minutes.
| Add the cabbage and the potatoes, simmering until the potatoes are cooked.
| Remove and discard the pigs' trotters.
| Slice the beef and bacon and arrange them, with the vegetables on plates or serving platters.
| Serve the stock separately as a gravy.
===Variations===
Sausages can also be added, especially if not using the pigs' trotters.

You can use other vegetables such as onions and turnips.
===Chef's notes===
Using bottled water for the stock, although not very ecological, will reduce the need to skim.  Filtered water can also be used.
