===Description===

Another experiment with a Taste Sensation marinade sample I have been sent.

This time using Taste Sensation Tangy Chipotle Marinade.  We're trying to eat less protein and more vegetables.  This should be healthier for us and might help us make food last longer should this Coronavirus force us to self-isolate for a prolonged period of time.

We've only used one large chicken breast for two people.  We shall cook this in our new Pro Breeze XL 5.5L Air Fryer
===Ingredients===

| 1 large chicken breast, cut into bit-sized pieces
| 1 tablespoon of Taste Sensation Tangy Chipotle Marinade
| 1 teaspoon lemon juice
| 1 tablespoon olive oil
| 2 tablespoons masa harina

===Method===


| Add all of the ingredients to a Lock and Lock style box, close the lid and shake like mad for a few minutes until the chicken pieces are well covered.
| Leave in a cool place for a few hours if you have the time.  It helps to make the flavours more intense.  Fine if you have to cook straight away though.
| Preheat the air fryer for 5 minutes at 180\u00b0
| Place the chicken nuggets in the hot air fryer basket and cook for 10 to 12 minutes.
| Serve immediately.

===Variations===
Plain old yellow cornmeal will make a perfect substitute for masa harina.
