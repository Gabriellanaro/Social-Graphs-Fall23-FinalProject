Winter warming fare this.  Needs a leather armchair afterwards!

[[Image:Teviot pie - baked.jpg|thumb|right|Teviot pie - baked to perfection]]
We recently discovered, and now often enjoy a Morrisons Teviot pie so thought it was about time to attempt a homemade version.  Although the classic Teviot pie has a suet pastry crust, I prefer the more subtle texture and flavour of a suet crust made with a potato dumpling mix.

Give it a try and see if you agree.
If you want to make this pie using the traditional method, '''''after''''' you have tried this recipe, you can always make it with a pure suet crust. :-)

'''pie filling'''
===Ingredients===
| 600g (1lb 5 oz) diced stewing steak, diced
| A few tablespoons of plain flour
| 284ml/ 1/2 pint of stock in total made with beef stock and including a dash of red wine
| Splash of Worcestershire sauce
| Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
| Pinch of mustard
| 1 large onion, peeled and chopped
| 2 tablespoons freshly chopped parsley
| 2 tablespoons tomato pur\u00e9e
'''suet crust'''
===Ingredients===NB
| 450g (1 lb) floury potatoes (Desiree, King Edward), peeled, boiled and mashed.  About two medium baking potatoes.
| 110g (4 oz) suet
| 110g (4 to 4½ oz) self-raising flour
| 1 heaped teaspoon of baking powder
| Salt and pepper to taste


===Mise en place===
Preheat oven to 140\u00b0 C (275\u00b0 F - gas 1)
===Method===


| Trim any excess fat from the steak and cut into bite-sized pieces
| Season the flour with salt and pepper, place in a Lock and Lock style box together with the steak pieces, seal the lid and shake well to coat.
| Layer the onion, meat and parsley into a buttered pie dish
| Mix the tomato pur\u00e9e, beef stock and mustard
| Pour the stock mixture into the dish so that the meat is about half covered.
| Cover the pie dish with tin-foil so it is completely sealed and bake for about 3 hours.
'''suet crust'''

| Mash the cooled potatoes into a large bowl and with you hands, rub in the suet, flour, seasoning and baking powder.  If the resulting mixture is too wet, add a little more flour.
| Store in a sealed container so it does not dry out and refrigerate whilst the pie filling slowly cooks.
| After the filling has cooked for 3 hours, increase the oven temperature to 200\u00b0C (400\u00b0F - Gas\t6)
| Check the suet mixture has not become too wet and correct using extra flour - the potatoes seem to release more moisture over time.
| To prevent it sticking to the work surface, use yellow cornmeal if you have it, plain flour if not and roll out the suet. Carefully remove the tin-foil from the pie dish and and lay the crust on the pie filling.
| Bake in the oven for 20 to 30 minutes until the suet crust has risen and is golden brown.
===Chef's notes===
If you are pushed for time, you can cook this for less time at a higher temperature, however, the steak won't be as succulent and flavoursome.

The quick version: 220\u00b0 C (425\u00b0 F - Gas 7 - Hot) and follow the cooking instructions for Steak and kidney pie including the tin-foil tip.

Don't be tempted to make the suet crust with a food processor, you will probably get a crust that does not rise.
