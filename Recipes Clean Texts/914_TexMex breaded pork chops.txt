===Description===

A really simple recipe that livens up pork chops.
[[Image:Old El Paso Taco Mix.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Old El Paso Taco Mix, the BIG container!]]

I make my own Tex-Mex mix / Taco mix but you can buy it in packet form in most supermarkets.  I notice in the US (Walmart), you can even buy a 200g container of it!  Be a while before that's available over here I guess.  Anyway, I do prefer my own!

After I made these I went on a search for a commercial blend 'tex-mex taco mix' that was available in large quantities.  I found Old India Taco Seasoning and was very pleased with the results.

I cooked these in the oven as it was already on for the Spicy honey-glazed butternut squash.  It also uses less fat this way.  You could just as easily grill or fry these.

===Ingredients===

| 2 pork chops
| 4 tablespoons breadcrumbs
| 2 tablespoons ground cornmeal
| 1 beaten egg
| 2 tablespoons Taco mix, or to taste
===Mise en place===

* Preheat the oven to 180\u00b0 C (350\u00b0 F - gas 4), [fan oven 160\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]

===Method===


| Mix the breadcrumbs, cornmeal and Tex-Mex mix together and spread out on a plate
| Dip the pork chops in the beaten egg, then coat the pork chops with the spicy breadcrumb mix
| Place on a baking tray with a wire grid and bake for 25 minutes.
| Check that the pork is properly cooked, allow to rest for 5 minutes, then serve.
