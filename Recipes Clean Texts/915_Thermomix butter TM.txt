===Description===

This is an ideal way of using up any excess double cream and the butter can be frozen.

===Ingredients===TM
| 250g-1kg double cream, at room temperature
| Salt (optional)
===Method===


| Pour the cream into the TM bowl.
| Whip for '''3 minutes / Speed 8''' until the buttermilk is separated.
| Every so often, check what stage it is at and scrape down the sides of the bowl - if you over whip it, it will revert to cream again.
| Strain through the internal steaming basket .
| Return the butter to the TM bowl together with 500g cold water.
| Mix '''10 seconds / Speed 4''' to wash the butter.
| Strain and repeat the process with a further 500g cold water.
| Strain, and squeeze out any excess water.
| Weigh the butter and add salt, if desired, at 1.2% for slightly salted and 1.7%-2.0% for fully salted.
| You can do this with your hands, or return the butter, with the salt to the TM and mix for a few seconds.
| Shape as desired, wrap in greaseproof paper or fill ramekin dishes and place in the refrigerator.
===Servings===
700 ml double cream makes 230 ml buttermilk / 225 g butter
===Variations===
You can add herbs, garlic, lemon zest or anything you like.
===Chef's notes===
Try to work quickly when squeezing out the excess water and shaping, especially if your kitchen is warm, otherwise it will become too soft and therefore difficult to handle.
