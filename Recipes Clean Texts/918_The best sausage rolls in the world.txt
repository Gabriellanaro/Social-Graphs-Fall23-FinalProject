===Description===

Dreaming up recipes to add to our cheat section was made really easy by a recent purchase of extremely high quality sausages from a local butcher. What a superb success - how these are not in Delia's cheat book I'll never know!

===Ingredients===
| 6 high quality sausages, preferably from your local butchers or farmers market
| 1 375g pre-rolled puff pastry


===Mise en place===
* Preheat the oven to 200\u00b0 C (400\u00b0 F - gas 6)
===Method===


| Allow the sausages and the pastry about 30 minutes to get to room temperature
| Unroll the pastry and cut into lengths large enough to cover the sausages
| Roll pastry around the sausages - don't overlap too much
| Cut a few slashes in the top
| Place on a lightly greased baking tray
| Bake until golden brown for about 30 minutes

===Serving suggestions===
Serve two of these with new potatoes and baked beans for a superb meal.
===Variations===
If you're not so keen on lots of pastry, cut it narrow and allow the sausages to poke out of each end
===Chef's notes===
I thought that a grill mesh would be a good idea as it would allow air under the rolls.  It was not, the pastry covers the grid and expands, making it impossible to remove them cleanly.  Use a greased baking tray!
