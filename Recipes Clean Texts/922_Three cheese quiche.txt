This is my interpretation of the multi-cheese quiches that have been popular over the years.

===Ingredients===
| Enough shortcrust pastry to line a 23cm (9 inch) flan tin (see Chef's notes below)
| 1 egg yolk, beaten
| 160g Cheddar cheese, cut into small cubes 
| 110g any semi-hard blue cheese, grated or crumbled
| 4 very large eggs, beaten
| 200ml milk
| Seasoning
| 110g any hard cheese, grated
===Method===


| Line the flan tin with the pastry.
| Prick holes with a fork all over the bottom and refrigerate for 30 minutes.
| Preheat the oven to 200\u00b0 C (400\u00b0 F - gas 6), [fan oven 180\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour].
| Bake blind for 20 minutes.
| Brush the beaten egg yolk over the base so that the fork holes are covered.
| Return to the oven, and bake for a further 7 minutes.
| Remove from the oven and leave to cool.
| Once cool, scatter the cubed Cheddar over the base.
| Mix the blue cheese with the egg, milk and seasoning and pour over the Cheddar cheese.
| Bake at 190\u00b0 C (375\u00b0 F - gas 5), [fan oven 170\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour] for 40 minutes.
| At this stage the mixture may still be unset, but that is fine.
| Sprinkle the grated hard cheese evenly over the top and bake for a further 10-20 minutes until the cheese starts to brown.
| During this period, it may rise like a souffl\u00e9, but it will soon revert to normal during cooling.
| Allow to cool to room temperature before serving.
===Serving suggestions===
Serve with salad and bread.
===Variations===
For this recipe I used Pembrokeshire Cheddar, Bleu de Beaude and Cerne Abbas cheeses, but you can use any of your choice.  I would avoid choosing 3 very salty cheeses as that would make it over-seasoned, so try to get a nice balance.
===Chef's notes===
For the pastry I used this recipe and made the full quantity.  There was enough left over to make a couple of pasties or a small quiche.  It is very difficult to specify how much pastry to make as it depends on the height of your tin and how thick you like your pastry.  I like mine fairly thin.
