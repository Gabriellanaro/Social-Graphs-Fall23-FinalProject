Lots of work involved in this but the results are worthwhile.

[[Image:3 sorts of chips.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Three different varieties - Purple Majesty, King Edward & Lady Balfour]]
These chips (Heston Blumenthal's Triple Cooked Chips), are time-consuming, so start well in advance, or even the previous day.  They are thick and therefore absorb less oil than thin ones.

===Ingredients===
| 1.1 kg large potatoes - approx. (eg. King Edward, Maris Piper, Rooster or Sante) peeled and cut into thick chips
| Salt
| Sunflower or peanut oil - follow your fryer's manufacturer's instructions as to quantity.


===Mise en place===
* Soak the chips in a pan of cold water for 45 minutes to remove excess starch.
===Method===


| Drain the soaked chips and bring to the boil, with the salt, in a pan of fresh cold water and cook for about 5-6 minutes.
| Immediately, remove from heat, drain, return to the pan and rinse off in cold water.  This may need to be done more than once.
| Drain again and dry the chips individually with kitchen towel.
| In a roasting tin lined with bake-o-glide or greaseproof paper, position the chips so that they are in rows and not touching each other.  You will probably need to use more than one tin, or use the tin's roasting rack upon which you can make a second layer.
| Put in the freezer for at least 30 minutes.
| Meanwhile, heat the oil to 130 C and remove the chips from the freezer.
| Pat them dry again and deep-fry in small batches until they look as if they are starting to change colour.  This could take 4 minutes or more.
| Drain on kitchen towel and when they are all cooked, return the to the roasting tin and freeze again for a further 30 minutes, or overnight if desired.
| About 20 minutes before you are ready to serve, reheat the oil to 190 C and cook the chips in batches again until golden (about 2 minutes or more).
| Drain and serve.
===Alternative method stages 1-3===
# Drain the soaked chips and bring a pan of cold, unsalted water to the boil, then add the chips.
# Reduce the heat and allow to simmer until almost cooked.
# Immediately, remove from heat, drain, and place them on a cake rack to cool, then follow from stage 4 above.
#Instead of boiling the chips, you can place them in a microwave in a covered container with 110ml water and cook for 6 minutes.  This is for large chips using a 900 watt microwave.
===Serving suggestions===
Well, chips can go with most dishes, but can also be served with garlic mayonnaise, dips or sauces as a snack.  You could sprinkle some grated melty cheese over them, such as Emmental, Tetilla, Mozzarella or Cheddar.
===Variations===
They can be made as thick or thin as you wish, but you will have to adjust the cooking times accordingly.
===Chef's notes===
If you do not have a deep-fat fryer, then a large saucepan will be fine, but DO be careful not to fill it more than a third full with the oil.  You will also need a thermometer to check the temperatures.
