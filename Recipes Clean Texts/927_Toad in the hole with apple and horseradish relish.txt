A classic dish reinvented with a mostly whole-grain gluten free batter. Serve with gravy for ultimate comfort, and a dollop of a creamy sweet kicking relish for something different.

| Remove the browned sausages from the baking dish, and wipe out any sticky residue from the caramelised onions that may have escaped from the sausages. Add a tablespoon of fresh olive oil into the dish, increase the oven heat to 220\u00b0C and heat the dish with oil for 5 minutes till really hot.
| After 5 minutes put the browned sausages back in the pan and pour the batter over them.
| Cook for a further 30-35 minutes, until the batter is puffed up, set and golden brown on top.
====relish====

| To make the relish, combine all the ingredients in a small bowl and transfer to a serving dish. Refrigerate until ready to eat.
