My variation on a recipe seen in The Times Saturday magazine, 21st may 2022.

A special looking meal that is simple to prepare.

Keep the basic ingredients like the chicken, garlic and mozzarella cheese, and add other ingredients of your choosing, just don't go easy on the garlic ðŸ˜†

===Ingredients===

| Up to 8 chicken thighs, depending upon size
| 2 125g balls of mozzarella cheese, drained and roughly torn
| 400g cherry tomatoes
| 2 teaspoons Taste Sensation Mexican seasoning
| 2 tablespoons sliced green jalapeno chilli peppers, the pickled type
| 4 tablespoons pickled green olives
| 2 small bulbs of garlic, cloves peeled and smashed
| 2 tablespoon olive oil
| 1 glass of red wine or sherry
| sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
| A pinch of Italian seasoning, or all purpose seasoning
| 2 tbs Taste Sensation Mixed Sweet Red and Green Bell Pepper Granules 
| A handful of fresh sage leaves
===Mise en place===

* Preheat your oven to 200\u00b0 C (400\u00b0 F - gas 6), [fan oven 180\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]

===Method===


| Add the chicken thighs to a large bowl and toss them in olive oil
| Mix the remaining ingredients together
| Mix all of the ingredients together and tip everything into the tray, arranging the chicken thighs so the skin can get crispy
| Pour the red wine into the base of the tray
| Scatter with sage leaves and roast in the oven for 40 minutes, discard any burnt leaves

===Serving suggestions===
Serve with new potatoes and a green vegetable.

===Chef's notes===
This is a great recipe for using up 'volunteers' from the fridge.  I would normally have used bottled sweet peppers but had run out,. so doubled-up on tomatoes instead.  Use sherry, red wine or even half a left-over can of lager just to moisten the dish.  A chopped up fennel bulb would be good too.
