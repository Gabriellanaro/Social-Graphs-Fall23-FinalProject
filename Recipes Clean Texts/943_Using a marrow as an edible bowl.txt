A really simple way to conjure up a tasty meal from freezer leftovers and a marrow from the garden. A scooped out marrow makes a really good edible plate or bowl.  In the time it takes to cook the marrow, the contents will be lovely and hot.  You could cook the contents from scratch but this was really an excuse to clear out the freezer.

In this instance , our filling was 1 portion of gulyas and 1 portion of a home-cooked chilli con carne that need a little more spice so both frozen meals were defrosted and mixed together with 3 finely chopped green indian chillies.

The blandness of the marrow nicely offsets the spiciness of the chilli.

===Ingredients===

| 1 medium sized marrow
| 2 portions of chilli-con-carne or a similar meal that has plenty of sauce and a chilli kick to it
===Mise en place===

* Preheat the oven to 200\u00b0 C (400\u00b0 F - gas 6), [fan oven 180\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour] - I've allowed for the oven preheat time in the preparation time, but you could add the marrow when the oven is first turned on and increase the overall cooking time a little - the contents are cooked anyway so as soon as the marrow is softened, the meal is ready

===Method===


| Scoop out and discard the marrow seeds and enough of the flesh to leave room for your filling, being careful to leave enough flesh to contain the filling as the marrow will 'collapse' as it cooks
| Place the two halves in an oven-proof dish that will prevent the marrows from falling over during cooking. I wedged a roll of silicone baking mat between the two halves in order hold them up during cooking
| Bake for 1 hour or until the marrow is softened

===Serving suggestions===
Serve with pitta bread.

===Chef's notes===
Be careful when eating this served straight from the oven as the marrow can be very hot!
