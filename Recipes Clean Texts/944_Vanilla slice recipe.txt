This recipe came as a visitor request and after a little research it seems for some reason this dessert is peculiar to Australia and New Zealand.  I have tried this out and it's quite good, though fairly filling.

===Ingredients===
| 1 500g pack of ready made puff pastry
| 1 cup granulated sugar
| ¼ cup cornflour
| 50 g butter
| 2 large egg yolks
| 2 teaspoons vanilla essence
| ½ cup custard powder
| 4 cups full cream milk
'''Lemon icing'''
* 1 cup icing sugar
* 1 teaspoon butter
* 2 teaspoons lemon juice
* Grated zest of ¼ lemon
* ½ teaspoon water

===Mise en place===
* Preheat the oven to 200\u00b0 C (400\u00b0 F - gas 6), [fan oven 180\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]
===Method===


| Leave the pastry at room temperature for a little while before rolling
| Cut the contents of packet in half and roll out each piece into 30 cm squares
| Place each square on an un-greased baking tray and stab all over with the tines/prongs of a fork to lessen the chance of it rising too much
| Bake for about 10 minutes or until browned
| Carefully trim each sheet to about 23 cm square and pat any risen areas back down with your hands
| Line a 23 cm square baking tray with tin-foil and allow plenty of overlap for easy removal
| Place one sheet of the pastry in the foil
| Add the sugar, cornflour and custard powder to a cold saucepan, add a little milk and combine to a paste
| Whisk in the remaining milk and mix well
| Add the butter, heat the pan and gently bring to the boil, stirring often
| Reduce the heat, stir in the vanilla essence and simmer for 3 minutes to thicken
| Whisk the egg yolks in a separate bowl and then whisk into the pan
| Pour the hot custard over the first piece of puff pastry, cover with the second sheet and pat down so it comes into contact with the custard everywhere
'''Lemon icing'''
# Beat the lemon juice and zest in with the butter. It may help to microwave the butter for a few seconds to soften first
# Beat in the icing sugar and add a little water if needed
# Allow the sandwich to cool then spread the icing evenly over the top
# Chill in the refrigerator
===Serving suggestions===

Cut into slices and dust with a little icing sugar
