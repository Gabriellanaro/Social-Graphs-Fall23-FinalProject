===Description===


Another of Mum's recipes from her sheaf of cookery notes.

This vegan fruit cake does not keep as well as a traditional fruit cakes so needs to be used fairly quickly.

===Ingredients===

| 150 ml olive oil
| 450 ml cold water

| 675 g (1.5 lb) mixed dried fruit (raisins, cherries, currants, sultanas & chopped apricots)
| 50 g (2 oz) chopped whole almonds
| 2 teaspoons ground mixed spice
| 1 tablespoon of Black treacle or molasses
| grated rind of 1 waxless lemon
| 75g (3 oz) muscovado sugar or jaggery
| 350g (12 oz) wholemeal self-raising flour
'''after the baking'''
===Ingredients===NB
| 45 ml (3 tablespoons) dark rum
===Mise en place===

* Preheat the oven to 150\u00b0 C (300\u00b0 F - gas 2), [fan oven 130\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]
===Method===



| Line and oil a 19 cm (7.5\") round cake tin.
| Add all of the cake ingredients to a large bowl and beat well unit smooth and evenly mixed.
| Pour the mixture into the greased cake tin and bake in the middle of the oven for 2 hours.
| The cake should feel firm to the touch and sound hollow when tapped if done.
| Allow to cool for 15 minutes then drizzle the rum evenly over the top of the cake.
| Leave until perfectly cool until slicing and serving.
