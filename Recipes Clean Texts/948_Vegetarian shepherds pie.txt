===Description===

This recipe is based on an idea by a good friend of ours.  Thank you Francis (and Martin for the vegetarian ''slant'').
===Ingredients===

====filling====
===Ingredients===NB
| 400g tinned green lentils, or cooked and drained green lentils
| ½ of a teaspoon of freshly ground black pepper
| 1 teaspoon olive oil
| 2 large white onions, peeled and finely chopped
| ½ teaspoon dried oregano
| 1/2 a teaspoon of dried sage
| 4 fat cloves of garlic, peeled and crushed
| 1 small red chili pepper,deseeded and finely chopped
| 1 teaspoon sea salt
====topping====
===Ingredients===NB
| 2 kg potatoes; peeled & boiled or steamed
| 300 ml hot milk
| Butter to taste
| 200 g vegetarian cheese; grated
===Mise en place===

* Pre-heat your oven to 200\u00b0 C (400\u00b0 F - gas 6), [fan oven 180\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]

===Method===


| Add the black pepper to the olive oil and gently saute the onions for 5 minutes in a large frying pan or wok
| Add the crushed garlic and fry for 30 seconds, then tip in the lentis and cook for a further 5 minutes
| Add the remaining filling ingredients, mix well and set to one side while you prepare the topping
| Mash the potatoes with the hot milk and butter
| Lightly oil a suitably sized oven-proof dish and fill with the lentil mixture
| Cover with with mashed potatoes and top with the grated cheese
| Bake for 25 minutes
| Serve with seasonal vegetables
===Variations===
Try other forms of canned beans or pulses. If the beans are large or have fairly tough skins, like kidney beans, crush them slightly first.
===Chef's notes===
You can use freshly chopped herbs instead of dried herbs; or a combination of both.  Use at least double the amount of fresh herbs.

Add a good pinch of dried or fresh herbs to the mashed potatoes
