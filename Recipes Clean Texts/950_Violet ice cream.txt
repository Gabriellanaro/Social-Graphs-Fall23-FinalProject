Hopeless ice cream maker

The recipe is fine, this ice cream maker is expensive and noisy. Avoid Cuisinart like the plague.

===Description===

Ice-cream made with violet extract.  If your ice-cream maker has no built-in freezer, place your bowl in the freezer for a minimum of 12 hours before using.

===Ingredients===

| 330g caster sugar
| 330ml full fat milk
| 600ml double cream
| \u00bc teaspoon violet extract (or to taste) - I used extract from Lakeland but different makes will vary in strength.
| Natural violet food colouring (optional)

===Method===


| Put all of the ingredients except for the cream into a bowl or tall jug
| Blend until the mixture is smooth using a stick blender
| Add the cream and blend briefly
| Allow to chill in the fridge for at least 1 hour
| Pour into your ice-cream maker and churn according to the manufacturer's instructions
| Transfer into a container and keep in the freezer
