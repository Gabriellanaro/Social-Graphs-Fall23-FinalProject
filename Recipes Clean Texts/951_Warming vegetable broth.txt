===Description===


A hot herby broth made with onions, root vegetables and leaves, ladled over grilled bread and finished with cheese. A soup similar to Italian ribollito, but made only with British ingredients and a great way to use up leftovers

===Ingredients===
| 4 tablespoons olive oil
| 3 medium sized white or red onions, peeled and chopped into small dice
| 2 Cloves of garlic, peeled and chopped
| 1 carrots, cut into small dice
| 1 celery stick and leaves, chopped finely
| About 4 tablespoons chopped vegetables, either turnip, squash, celeriac, swede or parsnip
| 2 large tomatoes, de-seeded and chopped, or 12 cherry tomatoes, quartered;
| 1.2 litres/2 pints chicken stock
| 1 can 225g haricot, borlotti or cannellini beans, drained
| 2 green savoy cabbage leaves, or cavolo nero (Italian black cabbage), shredded
| Salt and black pepper
'''To serve:'''
* 4 thick slices of day old ciabatta or sourdough bread
* Extra virgin olive oil
* 4 tablespoons of chopped parsley or basil
* 4 tablespoons of grated cheese, either mature cheddar, Caerphilly, Cheshire or Lancashire - or try Lord of the Hundreds or Berkswell, both hard pecorino-style sheeps\u0092 milk cheeses, made in the UK

===Method===


| To make the soup first grill the bread, brushing with a little oil then grilling in a dry pan or ridged grill pan over a medium heat until crisped. 
| Put a slice of bread into each warmed soup bowl.
| Heat the oil in a large pan and add the onion and garlic. 
| Cook over a low heat for 10 minutes; do not let them take on any colour or it will spoil the flavour of the soup.
| Add the carrots, celery and chopped vegetables and cook, stirring occasionally over a medium-low heat for another 3 minutes. 
| Add the tomatoes, cook for another 3 minutes then add the stock, beans and cabbage leaves and bring to the boil.
| Simmer until the cabbage leaves are tender, taste and add salt and pepper - you will need only the smallest amount.
| Serve the soup ladled over the grilled bread; sprinkle a few drops of extra virgin olive oil on top then scatter over the herbs and some grated cheese.
===Variations===
This is a very flexible recipe, designed to use up what you have in store - chop and change the vegetables as you wish, but always use onions.
