===Description===

This is a delicious fudge, the recipe for which I adapted from one for Thermomix.  Unfortunately, I can no longer find the original recipe.
===Ingredients===

| 200g white chocolate,chopped small or grated
| 400g can condensed milk (or make your own)
| 125g unsalted butter
| 80g sugar of any sort
| 1 tablespoon liquid glucose
| A handful of pistachio nuts
| A handful of dried cranberries (Craisins), plus some extra

===Method===


| Put the chocolate, condensed milk, butter, sugar and glucose in a non-stick saucepan.
| Dissolve over a medium low heat until smooth, stirring from time to time.
| Stir in the pistachio nuts and cranberries.
| Pour into a small baking tin, lined with clingfilm or Bake-O-Glide and sprinkle the extra cranberries over the top.
| Chill for at least an hour in the fridge until firm.
| Cut into squares and keep in the fridge in an airtight container.
===Variations===
You can use any dried fruit and nuts you like, but chop them a bit if largish
