===Description===

Another savoury winner from Mum's scribbled cookery notes.

This version uses wholemeal flour, see here for a version using white Self-raising flour.

===Ingredients===

| 450 g (1 lb) 100% wholemeal flour
| Big pinch of salt

| ½ pint (284 ml) milk
| Yellow cornmeal for rolling out.

* Preheat the oven to 200\u00b0 C (400\u00b0 F - gas 6), [fan oven 180\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]
===Method===



| Put the flour, baking powder, chilli powder and salt in a large bowl and mix together.
| Rub the butter into the mixture with your fingers until it resembles fine breadcrumbs.
| Mix in 225 g (8 oz) of the the grated cheese.
| Add enough of the milk as needed to produce a nice soft dough when mixed well.
| Knead this dough for a few minutes.
| Dust a work-surface with cornmeal and roll the dough out until it is about 2.5 cm (1\") thick

| Bake for 20 minutes until golden.
