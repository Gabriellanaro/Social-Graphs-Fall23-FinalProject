===Description===

This moist all-in-one cake is flavoured with chocolate, orange and walnuts and takes its name from the fact that it is my husband's recipe.  Wig is my daughter's nickname for him.

===Ingredients===
| 175g plain flour, sieved with
| 2 teaspoons baking powder
| 3 large eggs, beaten
| 175g soft butter
| 175g caster sugar
| The grated rind of 1 orange
| Â½ teaspoon vanilla extract
| 70g walnuts, slightly bashed in a plastic bag
| 50g Green and Black's Organic Dark Chocolate with Madagascan Vanilla (85% cocoa), coarsely bashed in a plastic bag
| 10g Icing sugar, for dusting


===Mise en place===
* Preheat the oven to 170\u00b0 C (325\u00b0 F - gas 3), [fan oven 140\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour].  
* Place the chocolate in the fridge whilst you are preparing the other ingredients.
===Method===


| Place all of the ingredients (except for the walnuts and chocolate) into a mixing bowl.
| Mix thoroughly using a hand or stand mixer - if using a Kenwood Chef / Major, use the Flexi-Beater.
| When the mixture is of an even consistency, add the walnuts and mix using the slowest setting.
| Grease and line a 20cm (8 inch) loose bottomed deepish cake tin.  There is no need to line if you are using a Silverwood tin.
| When the oven has reached the required temperature, gently mix in the chocolate using the slowest setting.
| Pour the mixture into the tin, smooth it out and bake so that the top of the tin is about halfway down the oven for about 50-60 minutes.
| Remove from the oven and allow to cool in the tin.
| To touch, it may not seem cooked, but it is and if you over cook it, you will loose too much moisture.
| Dust with icing sugar.
===Variations===
Use hazelnuts instead of walnuts
