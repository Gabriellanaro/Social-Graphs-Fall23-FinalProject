===Description===

This is a tongue-in-cheek nod to the Wimpy bender grill with the sausages bent around a circle with slashes in the side, in the original I believe a frankfurter was used - this much improved version uses chipolata sausages from Bexley's Gourmet sausage maker, bought from Hall Place Farmer's market, where we will be visiting again today as it is the first Sunday of the month.

With a few tomatoes, eggs from our chickens and a buttery mash speckled with home grown chives this is a massive improvement on the sad old Wimpy offering.
===Ingredients===
===Ingredients===

| 9 thin chipolata sausages - ( Gourmet sausage maker - Bexley )
| 5 medium tomatoes, halved
| 6 free range eggs
| 1 portion of Mashed potato recipe
| Bunch of freshly chopped chives
| Balsamic vinegar
| Olive oil
| Salt and pepper
===Mise en place===

* Preheat the oven to 180\u00b0 C (350\u00b0 F - gas 4), [fan oven 160\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]

| Add a sprinkle of salt and pepper from a height
| Bake at 180\u00b0 C (350\u00b0 F - gas 4) for 25 minutes at the top of the oven.  Finish for the final 5 minutes under the grill to brown the sausages nicely
| Fry the eggs in olive oil using egg rings
