===Description===

Another recipe to help you use up your squashes and pumpkins.  Will serve 4 as a starter or bulked out with a little pan fried fish such as basa or bass, it would make an excellent main course

===Ingredients===
| 800g squash - any type will do
| 100g walnut pieces (half the price of walnut halves!)
| Small bag of rocket leaves or spicy green salad leaves
| 1 large garlic bulb
| 12 fresh sage leaves
| Olive oil
| 20g shavings of parmesan cheese to serve


===Mise en place===
* Break the bulb of garlic into cloves. Leave them un peeled
* Peel and de-seed the squash, cut into bite-sized chunks
* Preheat the oven to 200\u00b0 C (400\u00b0 F - gas 6)
===Method===


| Lightly oil a large oven-proof baking tray
| Distribute the squash pieces, garlic cloves, and sage leaves evenly. Season well with salt and pepper and drizzle with plenty of olive oil
| Roast uncovered for about an hour.  The squash should just be browning at the edges
| Add the walnuts in a separate dish to toast for the last 5 minutes
| Toss the squash once more before serving
| Dress 4 plates with the salad leaves and scatter over with the squash, garlic, walnuts and sage leaves
