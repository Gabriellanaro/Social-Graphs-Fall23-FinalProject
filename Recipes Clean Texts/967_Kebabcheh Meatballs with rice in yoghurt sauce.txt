This recipe from Bulgaria has an Ottoman influence.

The meatballs freeze well, although you would need to make the sauce afresh.

===Ingredients===
| 500 g lamb or beef, minced
| 1 small onion, finely chopped
| 1 egg, beaten
| 4 tablespoons fresh breadcrumbs
| 1 teaspoon salt
| 1 heaped teaspoon dried or 1 tablespoon fresh marjoram or oregano.
| 400 ml lamb or beef stock
| 2 tablespoons long grain rice. Don't rinse this rice.
| 150 ml yogurt beaten with 2 egg yolks
===Method===


| Mix the first 6 ingredients in a bowl and knead until smooth.
| Divide the mixture into 20, and with wet hands, shape each piece into a small ball.
| Pour the stock into a large saucepan and bring to the boil.
| Reduce the heat, gently add the meatballs, cover and simmer for 15 minutes.
| Carefully stir in the rice and simmer for a further 20 minutes.
| Remove the meatballs from the pan and  keep warm in a serving dish.
| Reduce the heat under the pan to the lowest setting and gradually stir in the yogurt and egg mixture.
| Stir continuously until the sauce thickens, without allowing it to boil.
| Pour the sauce over the meatballs and serve immediately.
===Serving suggestions===
Serve with pilav rice and salad.

This is delicious and will be made again.  It's quite rich and creamy and I think would be nice with a few cold sliced tomatoes and some roasted sweet peppers or perhaps a Tomato and onion salad.  Wedges of lemon would be nice too.
===Variations===
If you wish, add garlic and substitute the marjoram for oregano or other herbs.
===Chef's notes===
If like me, you can't bring yourself to add a whole teaspoon of salt to any recipe, just add what you are comfortable using, or none!

I guess the idea of the rice is to thicken the sauce.  If you also find that fails, try the following; it worked fine for me:

Before adding the yogurt, add a teaspoon of arrowroot or cornflour to a saucer, add a tablespoon of the sauce and mix until combined, add this back to the sauce and heat until thickened. Leave to cool for a few minutes or the yogurt will split.  Stir in the yogurt and continue the recipe.
===Serving suggestions===
This went really well with couscous and fennel, red onion and orange salad.
