===Method===


| Heat the oil in a large pan to a medium heat and add the onion, carrots, celery, potato and garlic.
| Saut\u00e9, stirring often, for about 10 minutes.
| Add the tomatoes and the seasonings, and cook for a further 10 minutes, stirring from time to time.
| Stir in the parsley and cheese, cook for a further 5 minutes and then remove from heat, setting aside for 10 minutes to cool a little.
| Meanwhile, spoon the mixture into the peppers and replace the tops.
| Put the peppers into a large casserole dish, standing upright and pour in the stock or water.
| Cover the dish and bake for 45 minutes.
| I used an old potato with the base cut flat to support the peppers whilst they cooked.
| While the peppers are cooking, make the sauce by combining all the ingredients in a bowl.
| When the 30 minutes cooking time is up, pour the sauce over the peppers.
| Carry on cooking until the sauce has thickened and turned golden.
| Serve immediately.
===Serving suggestions===
Serve with salad and potatoes and/or rice.
===Variations===
You can this mixture to stuff other vegetables, eg 8 medium-large tomatoes, 8 medium courgettes, 10-12 artichoke hearts or even portobello mushrooms.
===Chef's notes===
Not having any celery, I used a large bunch of leaves from my cutting celery - I also added plenty of fresh basil too.  Following Delia's advice of years ago, I used cr\u00e8me fraiche instead of yogurt because it is far less likely to split when heated.

I would reduce the salt if you are using halloumi cheese or if the stock you are using is already fairly salty.

This recipe was a great chance to use lots of Annabelle's lovely dark and nutty olive oil, pressed from here own plantation - ''second pressing''.

The sauce turned into a sort of cement. It tasted really nice but was rather odd!
