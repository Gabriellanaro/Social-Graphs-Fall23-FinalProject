Half- asleep this morning, my husband was muttering about a mixture of a spicy kedgeree and a greasy version of a traditional English breakfast, so I came up with with this cheap and cheerful version.

===Description===


===Ingredients===
| 180g haddock steaks
| 1 litre fish stock
| 2 tablespoons of sunflower or rapeseed oil, plus a bit extra
| Garlic to taste, chopped
| Indian green chillies to taste, chopped
| 140g mushrooms, sliced
| 1 heaped teaspoon Pakistani basar
| 400g basmati rice
| 40g cooked chorizo, thinly sliced and coarsely chopped
| 100g chipolata sausages
| 180g smoked back bacon, rind removed, coarsely chopped
| 4 free range eggs

===Method===


| Poach the haddock in the fish stock for about 8 minutes.
| Meanwhile, heat the oil in a pan, add the garlic, chillies and mushrooms and saut\u00e9 for a few minutes.
| Add the Pakistani basar and cook for a further minute.
| Stir in the rice and coat it in the oil.
| Remove the haddock and pour the stock over the rice.
| Cover, and simmer over a low heat for about 15 minutes or until the rice has absorbed the stock.
| Sir in the chorizo minute or two before the end of the cooking time.
| While this is happening, flake the haddock and keep warm.
| Fry the sausages and bacon in a separate pan with some fresh oil and stir into the rice mixture, with the haddock - keep over a low heat, covered.
| Fry the eggs until the white is just set, but the yolk, runny.
| Chop the eggs roughly.
| Serve the kedgeree immediately, topped with the fried eggs
===Serving suggestions===
If you wish to add to the greasy spoon idea, serve with triangles of fried bread, but I defy anyone to add baked beans or smear it with ketchup!
===Variations===
Smoked haddock can be used (and indeed, is traditional), but I didn't have any.  Pakistani basar can be difficult to obtain, so use a mixture of your favourite curry spices instead.
===Chef's notes===
I have no idea what this tastes like, but my husband says it is the best of the kedgerees I have made. :-)  Try to get the best quality chorizo you can.
