I've now made this many times and I don't ever bother with the blowtorch - tastes the same without \ud83d\ude42

===Description===

This is my first experiment at 'roasting' a whole chicken at a time using a water bath.  I have not cooked it whole as such, but cut it in half, for more even cooking.  The joy of using this method is that basting is not required.

===Ingredients===

| 1 whole chicken, weighing about 1.3kg, spatchcocked
| 50 ml Oil or butter
| Herbs, spices, seasoning
===Mise en place===

* Preheat the water bath to 71\u00b0 C (''160\u00b0 F'')

===Method===


| If desired, rub the chicken in your choice of herbs or spice mix.
| Vacuum pack each chicken half into sealing bags.
| Cook in the water bath for at least 6 (maximum 8) hours.
| Remove from the bath and pat dry.
| Heat oil or butter over a high heat (less so if using butter) in a large sauteuse or frying pan.
| Place the chicken halves in the pan and sear for 2 minutes on each side until golden brown.
| If you have not added any herbs and spices to the sealing bags, you can add them to the pan for the last 30 seconds of cooking.
===Serving suggestions===
Serve with potatoes and vegetables or cool and accompany with salad.
===Chef's notes===
You can also use a blowtorch to sear the chicken, in which case any spices or herbs are best added to the sealing bags at the beginning.
