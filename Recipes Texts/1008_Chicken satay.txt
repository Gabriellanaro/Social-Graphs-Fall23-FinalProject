She loves [[Satay sauce|satay sauce]] though.  Odd, I know!\n\nAs with any [[Chicken|chicken]] dish, I [[Marinade|marinade]] the chicken pieces in a few tablespoons of [[Lemon juice|lemon juice]], half a teaspoon of fine [[Salt|salt]] and a splash of [[Olive oil|olive oil]].  This was a useful tip picked up on my first [[Indian cookery]] class, many moons ago.  I've also added a dash of [[Dark soy sauce|dark soy sauce]]. My [[Jaccard meat tenderiser]] has been brought into play on chicken for the first time.  We'll see if that makes any noticeable difference.\n\nI've used bone in [[Chicken thighs|chicken thighs]] as they were inexpensive.  These are not idea for skewering so I'll cook them in the [[Oven|oven]] and eat around the [[bones]].\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| 8 [[Chicken thighs|chicken thighs]]\n| 2 tablespoons [[Lemon juice|lemon juice]]\n| \u00bd teaspoon fine [[Salt|salt]]\n| 1 tablespoon [[Dark soy sauce|dark soy sauce]]\n| 1 teaspoon medium [[Curry powder|curry powder]]\n| 1 teaspoon [[Turmeric powder|turmeric powder]]\n| 1 teaspoon sugar\n| \u00bd teaspoon white [[Cumin seeds|cumin seeds]]\n| \u00bd teaspoon [[Black cumin seeds|black cumin seeds]]\n| 2 [[Green Indian chillies|green indian chillies]]\n| 2 [[Red chillies|red chillies]]\n| 4 [[Fat|fat]] [[Cloves of Garlic, peeled and crushed|cloves of garlic, peeled and crushed]]\n| Thumb-sized piece of [[Ginger|ginger]], peeled and roughly chopped\n| Bunch of [[Spring onions|spring onions]]\n| Bunch of fresh [[Coriander|coriander]]\n| 6 tablespoons crunchy [[Peanut butter|peanut butter]]\n| 1 tablespoon [[Tahini|tahini]]\n| 3 [[Limes|limes]]\n| 2 tablespoons of [[Light soy sauce|light soy sauce]]\n| [[Peanut oil]]\n| Small tin of [[Pineapple|pineapple]] rings\n}}\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n\n* Remove the skin from the [[Chicken thighs|chicken thighs]].

Add the chicken pieces  and [[Marinade|marinade]] for 6 hours of so in a cool place.\n* A few hours before you want to cook the [[Chicken|chicken]], cut some big slashes in them so there are large surface areas for the cover.

Shake well and [[Refrigerate|refrigerate]] for a few hours.\n* 30 minutes before you're ready to cook, preheat the [[Oven|oven]] and a [[Griddle pan|griddle pan]] to 200\u00b0 C (400\u00b0 F - gas 6), [fan oven 180\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| De-seed one of each of the [[green chillies]] and one of the [[Red chillies|red chillies]] and peel and roughly chop the [[Garlic|garlic]] and [[ginger]].\n| In a dry pan, heat the [[Cumin seeds|cumin seeds]] until they pop.
