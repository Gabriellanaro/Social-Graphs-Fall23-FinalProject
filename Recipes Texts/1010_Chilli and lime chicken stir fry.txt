I used their excellent [[Chilli and Lime Seasoning]] recently in [[Chili and lime spiced butternut squash]].  This time I thought I would try a [[Stir-fry|stir-fry]].\n\nI've used Morrisons pre-packed [[Stir-fry|stir-fry]] ingredients as they are the easiest way to get a decent variety of [[Vegetables|vegetables]].  Half quantities of these packs are perfect for a two-person [[Stir fry|stir fry]].  Just check the quality of the [[Bean sprouts|bean sprouts]] as they can be rather close to sell-by (or bin-by) [[Date|date]].\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| 1 large [[Chicken breast|chicken breast]], cut into thin strips\n| 1 heaped tablespoon of [[Taste Sensation Chilli and Lime Seasoning]]\n| 3 tablespoons of [[Olive oil|olive oil]]\n| Half a packet of [[Bean sprouts|bean sprouts]] [180 g]\n| Half a packet of fresh [[Egg noodles|egg noodles]] [205 g]\n| Half a packet of Sweet & Crunchy [[Stir fry|stir fry]] [300 g]\n| Splash of [[Dark soy sauce|dark soy sauce]] - optional\n| Splash of [[Dry sherry|dry sherry]] - optional\n}}\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n\n* If you get the chance, leave the [[Chicken|chicken]] pieces, dusted with the [[Taste Sensation Chilli and Lime Seasoning]] in the [[refrigerator]] for a few hours beforehand to enhance the flavour.\n\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| Pop the sliced [[Chicken|chicken]] in a [[Lock and Lock box|lock and lock box]] together with the [[Taste Sensation Chilli and Lime Seasoning]] and one of the tablespoons of [[Olive oil|olive oil]].  Shake like crazy to mix.  Leave to [[Marinade|marinade]] for a while if you get the chance.\n| This is quicker and easier if you have two woks, if not cook the [[Chicken|chicken]] first and keep warm while you cook the [[Vegetables|vegetables]]\n| [[Stir fry]] the [[Chicken|chicken]] in a tablespoon of [[Olive oil|olive oil]], turning regularly until the chicken is properly cooked - about 5 minutes or longer if it's thickly sliced\n| [[Stir-fry]] the [[Vegetables|vegetables]] in a tablespoon of [[Olive oil|olive oil]] until they are wilted\n| Toss in the [[Beans|beans]] shoots and [[Noodles|noodles]] and [[Stir-fry|stir-fry]] until cooked - about 4 minutes\n| If using, add a splash of [[Sherry|sherry]] and [[Soy sauce|soy sauce]] and mix well\n| Mix in the cooked [[Chicken|chicken]] and serve immediately\n}}\n===Variations===\nYou can also cook the [[Chicken|chicken]] in an air-fryer basket for about 5 minutes, instead of pan-[[Frying|frying]]\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Chinese recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Spicy recipes]]\n[[Category:Chilli pepper recipes]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:Poultry recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegetable recipes]]\n[[Category:Stir fried]]\n[[Category:Taste Sensation recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#chicken #oliveoil #vegetables #stirfry #beansprouts #chilliandlimechickenstirfry #refrigerator #noodles #drysherry #tastesensationrecipes #date </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
