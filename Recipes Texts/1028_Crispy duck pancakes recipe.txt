As with any [[dough]], tinker some more if needed.\n| Put the [[dough]] back in the bowl to rest for 30 minutes, covered with a damp cloth.\n| Back on to the work surface for another 5 minutes of kneading and tinkering.\n| When you have a smooth, pliable [[dough]], hand-roll into a sausage 45 cm (18\") long and 2.5cm(1\") thick.\n| Chop into 18 equal pieces and mould them into balls. Take two of the balls. Dip one side of one ball into the [[sesame oil]] and put the oiled side on top of the other ball.\n| Mass production! With a [[rolling pin]], roll the 2 pancakes simultaneously into a 15 cm (6\") disc. \n| Put the double pancake into a [[frying]]-pan or [[wok]] on a very gentle heat for a few minutes, really just to dry it out a little.\n| Turn it over and repeat for the other side.\n| Allow to cool, but before it gets cold, peel the two pancakes apart.\n| Do this with the remaining pairs of pancakes.\n| These can be [[frozen]] for later use.\n| [[Steam]] or microwave them to reheat and then serve with [[crispy duck]].\n}}\n==See also==\n* [[Traditional English pancakes]]\n* [[Breton buckwheat pancake recipe]]\n* [[Cr\u00eape recipe]]\n* [[Potato pancakes]]\n* [[Crispy duck pancake recipe]]\n* [[Crispy potato pancakes]]\n* '''Procedure to make a [[How to make crispy aromatic duck at home|complete crispy duck meal at home]].'''\n\n{{CategoryLine}}\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Oriental cuisine]]\n[[Category:Chinese recipes]]\n[[Category:Starters]]\n[[Category:Steamed]]\n[[Category:Microwaved]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#dough #frozen #sesameoil #flour #steam #pekingduck #crispyduck #pancakes #rollingpin #wok #crispyduckpancakesrecipe </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
