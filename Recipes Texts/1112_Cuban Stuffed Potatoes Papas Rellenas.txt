In fact, this is an excellent recipe for using up leftover [[Mashed potatoes|mashed potatoes]]. To make papas rellenas, you first prepare some [[Picadillo|picadillo]] or seasoned [[Ground beef|ground beef]] filling, similar to an [[Empanada|empanada]] filling. Then you mold some [[Mashed potatoes|mashed potatoes]] around a center of [[Ground|ground]] [[Beef|beef]], and you form the whole thing into an oblong shape - basically you make it look like a [[Potato|potato]]! Then you [[Fry|fry]] it in [[Oil|oil]] until it's golden [[Brown|brown]] and crispy. Kids love this meal, especially with [[Ketchup|ketchup]].\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| &#189; cup [[Raisins|raisins]]\n| 3 pounds yellow [[Potatoes|potatoes]]\n| &#189; cup chopped [[Onion|onion]]\n| 2 [[Cloves garlic, minced|cloves garlic, minced]]\n| 1 tablespoon [[Minced|minced]] [[aji pepper]], or [[Jalapeno|jalapeno]]\n| 1 teaspoon [[Goya Adobo-without-Pepper]]\n| &#189; teaspoon [[Paprika|paprika]]\n| 1 pound [[Ground beef|ground beef]]\n| 1 cup [[Beef|beef]] [[Broth|broth]]\n| 1 large [[Egg|egg]]\n| [[Flour]] for dusting\n| [[Salt]] and [[Pepper|pepper]] to taste\n}}\n\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| Place the [[Raisins|raisins]] in a small bowl and pour 1 cup [[Boiling|boiling]] water over them. Let them soak for 10 minutes. \n| Bring a large pot of [[Salted|salted]] water to a [[Boil|boil]]. Peel the [[Potatoes|potatoes]] and place them in the pot. Cook the [[Potatoes|potatoes]] until they are tender when pierced with a fork. \n| While the [[Potatoes|potatoes]] are cooking, cook the [[Onions|onions]], [[Garlic|garlic]], and [[Peppers|peppers]] in the [[Vegetable oil|vegetable oil]] until soft and fragrant. \n| Add the [[Cumin|cumin]] and [[Paprika|paprika]] and cook 2 minutes more, stirring. Add the [[Ground beef|ground beef]] and cook until [[Browned|browned]]. \n| Drain the [[Raisins|raisins]] and add them to the [[Ground beef|ground beef]]. Add the [[Beef|beef]] [[Broth|broth]] and [[Simmer|simmer]] for 10 to 15 minutes more, until most of the liquid is gone. \n| Season mixture with [[Salt|salt]] and [[Pepper|pepper]] to taste. Remove from heat and let cool. \n| When the [[Potatoes|potatoes]] are cooked, drain them in a [[Colander|colander]]. [[Mash]] the [[Potatoes|potatoes]] thoroughly, or pass them through a [[Potato ricer|potato ricer]]. Season the [[Mashed potatoes|mashed potatoes]] with [[Salt|salt]] and [[Pepper|pepper]] to taste. Chill the potatoes for several hours, or overnight. \n| Once the [[Potatoes|potatoes]] are very cold, stir the [[Egg|egg]] into the [[Mashed potatoes|mashed potatoes]] until well mixed. \n| Shape the papas rellenas: with floured [[Hand|hand]]s, place about &#188; cup of [[Mashed potatoes|mashed potatoes]] in one [[Hand|hand]], and make a well in the centre. Fill the well with 1-2 tablespoons of the [[Beef|beef]] mixture. Mould the [[Potatoes|potatoes]] around the [[Beef|beef]], adding more [[Potatoes|potatoes]] if necessary, and shape the whole thing into an oblong [[Potato|potato]] shape, with slightly pointy ends, about the size of a medium [[Potato|potato]]. \n| Repeat with the [[Rest|rest]] of the [[Mashed potatoes|mashed potatoes]]. Coat each stuffed \"[[Potato|potato]]\" with [[Flour|flour]]. \n| In a deep [[Skillet|skillet]] or [[Deep fat fryer|deep fat fryer]], heat 2 inches of [[Oil|oil]] to 360 [[Degrees|degrees]]. [[Fry]] the [[Potatoes|potatoes]] in batches until they are golden [[Brown|brown]]. Drain them on a plate lined with [[Paper towels|paper towels]].\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nKeep the [[Potatoes|potatoes]] warm in a 200 degree [[Oven|oven]] until ready to serve.\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Cuban recipes]]\n[[Category:Accompaniments]]\n[[Category:Snacks and light bites]]\n[[Category:Spicy recipes]]\n[[Category:Tapas, mezze and antipasti]]\n[[Category:Beef recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegetable recipes]]\n[[Category:CubanCuisine.co.uk]]\n[[Category:Pan fried]]\n[[Category:Recipes from other sites]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#potatoes #mashedpotatoes #groundbeef #beef #potato #raisins #egg #paprika #cubanstuffedpotatoespapasrellenas #flour #fry </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
