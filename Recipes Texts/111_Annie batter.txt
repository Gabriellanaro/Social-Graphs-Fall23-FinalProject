It is copied from [[Delia Smith]]'s 'Complete Cookery Course' but with a few changes that over the years have proven to make a perfect [[Batter|batter]] with a good rise.\n\nIn [[Delia]]'s recipe she says it will serve 4 but I disagree, it serves 2 [[Pigs|pigs]] with a few leftover [[Popovers|popovers]].\n\nThe three main tricks to getting a well risen Yorkshire every time are:\n\n* Whisk by [[Hand|hand]], just enough to combine well. Do not use an electric whisk or go mad when hand beating\n\n* Allow the [[Batter|batter]] to reach room temperature by resting for 30 minutes first.  Do not rest in the [[Fridge|fridge]].  This will reduce the rise substantially.\n\n* [[Oil]] the [[Popover|popover]] or [[Yorkshire pudding tray]] and heat over a naked flame just before pouring the [[Batter|batter]] mixture into the tray, then put in the over immediately.\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| 75 g (3 oz) [[Plain flour|plain flour]]\n| 1 large [[Egg|egg]]\n| '''A total of 130 ml (5 fl oz) of liquid, comprised of:'''\n| 75 ml (3 fl oz) [[Milk|milk]] ''any type of milk is fine''\n| 55 ml (2 fl oz) water\n| Pinch of [[Sea Salt|sea salt]]\n| Pinch of [[Freshly ground black pepper|freshly ground black pepper]]\n| 2 tablespoons [[Vegetable oil|vegetable oil]] to grease [[baking tray]]\n}}\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n\n* Preheat the [[Oven|oven]] to 220\u00b0 C (425\u00b0 F - gas 7), [fan oven 200\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]\n\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| Sift the [[Flour|flour]] into a large bowl\n| Add the [[Milk|milk]], water and [[Salt|salt]] and [[Pepper|pepper]] to a jug\n| Make a depression in the middle of the [[Flour|flour]] and break the [[Egg|egg]] into it\n| Using a [[Hand|hand]] whisk, beat the [[Egg|egg]] into the [[Flour|flour]]\n| Once the [[Egg|egg]] and [[Flour|flour]] starts to combine, gradually mix in all of the liquids\n| [[Rest]] at '''room temperature''' for 30 minutes - do not refrigerate\n| Using a silicone [[Brush|brush]], distribute 2 tablespoons of [[Vegetable oil|vegetable oil]] into the [[Yorkshire pudding tray]] or [[Popover tray|popover tray]]\n| Carefully heat the tray on the [[Hob|hob]] top until the [[Oil|oil]] starts to sizzle\n| Pour the [[Batter|batter]] mixture evenly into the tray\n| Pop into the top of the [[Oven|oven]] and [[Bake|bake]] for 25 to 30 minutes\n}}\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Accompaniments]]\n[[Category:Bread and baking]]\n[[Category:Historic recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes]]\n[[Category:Egg recipes]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#flour #egg #batter #hand #yorkshirepuddingtray #vegetableoil #deliasmith #anniebatter #pigs #delia #plainflour </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
