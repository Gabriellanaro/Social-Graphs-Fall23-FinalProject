It's also worth noting that the overall flavour of the dish is very much influenced by the smoked meats that are used in the layers, so choose them carefully.  Junk in - junk out.\n\nThe casserole dish I used was really too small, this could have been better done in a two smaller dishes or a lesser quantity to start with.\n\n===Chef's notes===\n{{Template:ThinkPig}}\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Beef recipes]]\n[[Category:Czech recipes]]\n[[Category:Greek recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:Pork recipes]]\n[[Category:Rice recipes]]\n[[Category:Romanian recipes]]\n[[Category:Serbian recipes]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#sarma #cabbage #smoked #sauerkraut #tomatojuice #pork #bake #eggs #nutmeg #onion #beef </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
