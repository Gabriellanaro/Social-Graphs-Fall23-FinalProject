I've added this recipe as a cheat because it's so simple to make and requires no cooking.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 225 g (8 oz) [[Smoked salmon|smoked salmon]] slices\n| 1 ripe [[Avocado|avocado]]\n| 2 teaspoons [[Lemon juice|lemon juice]]\n| 50 g (20 oz) [[Cream cheese|cream cheese]]\n| 150 ml (1/4 pint) [[Double cream|double cream]], whipped\n| [[Freshly ground black pepper]]\n| 3 drops of [[Worcestershire sauce]]\n}}\n'''garnish'''\n* 4 tablespoons of [[Sour cream|sour cream]]\n* Fresh [[Dill|dill]] leaves\n* 2 slices of [[Brown bread]] and [[Butter|butter]]\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Smoked salmon timbales in a muffin tray.jpg|Formed, ready to chill for a few hours\nImage:Smoked salmon cream blended.jpg|A food processor mixed this rather successfully\nImage:Smoked salmon timbales ingredients.jpg|The ingredients - I didn't use the soured cream in the end\n</gallery>\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Line 4 small [[ramekin dishes]] with slices of [[Smoked salmon|smoked salmon]], leave a little aside to make lids.\n| Add the [[Avocado|avocado]], [[Lemon juice|lemon juice]] and [[Cream cheese|cream cheese]] and [[Mash|mash]] to a [[Puree|puree]].\n| Fold in the whipped [[Double cream|double cream]] and add the [[Black pepper|black pepper]] and [[Worcestershire sauce]].\n| Divide the mixture into four portions and fill the ramekin dishes, top with a cover of [[Smoked salmon|smoked salmon]].  Chill in the [[Refrigerator|refrigerator]] for at least 30 minutes to firm up.\n| Turn the timbales out onto serving plates, surround with  swirl of [[Sour cream|sour cream]] and sprinkle with [[Dill|dill]].\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe with [[Brown bread|brown bread]] and [[Butter|butter]].\n===Variations===\nTry [[Tabasco]] or [[Louisiana Hot Pepper Sauce|Louisiana hot pepper sauce]] instead of  [[Worcestershire sauce]].\n===Chef's notes===\nI have made plenty of changes from the original recipe:\n\nBecause almost every ingredient in this recipe is so high in [[cholesterol]] I decided to omit the [[soured cream]] as a garnish altogether. I also reduced the size of the [[timbales]] by using a silicone muffin tray instead of [[ramekin dishes]].  This made more, smaller timbales.\n\nBecause of the astronomical cost cost of sliced [[smoked salmon]], I used 100 g of sliced [[smoked salmon]] and 120 g of smoked salmon trimmings (87p!) - these I sliced thinly and chopped with a very sharp knife.\n\nAs the [[avocado]] was not as ripe as it could have been, I mixed everything in a food processor with a sharp blade.  This whipped the cream, chopped the [[avocado]] to mush and mixed it up rather well.\n\nAfter 6 'muffins' there was still a some filling and some smoked salmon trimmings left over.  These I mixed up into a small container and after chilling will probably make a rather fine spread - for breakfast maybe?\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Cookery cheats]]\n[[Category:Fish recipes]]\n[[Category:Freshwater fish recipes]]\n[[Category:Sea fish recipes]]\n[[Category:Danish recipes]]\n[[Category:Snacks and light bites]]\n[[Category:Starters]]\n\n[[Category:Uncooked]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#smokedsalmon #smokedsalmontimbales #avocado #worcestershiresauce #ramekindishes #butter #doublecream #sourcream #dill #lemonjuice #creamcheese </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
