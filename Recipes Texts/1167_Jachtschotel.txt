Use whatever combination you like.  However, I am not sure about the wisdom (for safety reasons) of using [[Pork|pork]], as this [[Meat|meat]] should not be re-cooked.\n\nAgreeing with Julia regarding the pork, I scratch cooked pork loins in a nice soup for this dish as that's what the apples go best with.\n===Chef's notes===\nThere was not enough mashed potato to layer as described so I just added the meat and soup, a layer of apples and then the mashed potato and breadcrumbs.\n\nI should have realised that at 190\u00b0 the apples would never cook.  They were barely warm!  They either need to be on the very top, very thinly sliced or maybe even grated.\n\n==See also==\n* [http://dutchfood.about.com/od/mainmeals/r/Jachtschotel-Hunters-Dish.htm Jachtschotel-Hunters-Dish (About.com)]\n* [http://recipes.wikia.com/wiki/Jachtschotel Jachtschotel (Recipes Wikia]\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes|Jachtschotel]]\n[[Category:Dutch recipes|Jachtschotel]]\n[[Category:Main courses|Jachtschotel]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes|Jachtschotel]]\n[[Category:Potato recipes|Jachtschotel]]\n[[Category:Fruit recipes]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#jachtschotel #butter #potatoes #onions #apples #breadcrumbs #pork #baking #stock #fry #meatstock </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
