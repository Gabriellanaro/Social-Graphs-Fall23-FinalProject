(\"Pacha\" means \"earth\", and \"manca\" means \"pot\" in Quechua). To prepare it you need some open space. When you don't have it, you can prepare pachamanca in olla. It is cooked over the fire in a clay pot.\n\n'''Note:'''  for the pachamanca - you can have one [[Meat|meat]], two [[Meats|meats]], or more!!!\n\n'''[[Meats|meats]]'''\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 900 g (2 lb) [[Lamb]] chops\n| 900 g (2 lb) [[Pork chops]]\n| 900 g (2 lb) whole [[Chickens]], quartered\n| 8 [[humitas]]\n| 2 cups [[Marinade]] Mixture\n}}\n'''[[Marinade|marinade]] mixture (2 cups)'''\n{{RecipeIngredientsNB\n| 2 cups [[Chicha]] de Jora\n| 1 [[Cilantro]] stems and leaves ([[coriander]]).

Thank you Julia!\n* [[Huacatay]] is a type of marigold and seeds can be obtained from:  '''[http://www.chilternseeds.co.uk/item_1222d_tagetes_minuta_seeds Chiltern Seeds]'''.  Looks like they kill off weeds as well!\n* [[Chicha de Jora]] is a bit trickier as it is a drink made from [[sweetcorn|corn]].  There is a recipe for making it [http://www.ehow.com/how_2099371_make-chicha-de-jora.html here] , but I would suggest substituting it with a slightly sweetish [[white wine]].\n* [[Chincho leaves]] - I think they will be impossible to get here.  Seems they are related to [[huacatay]] and used to be used to treat malaria.  I wonder if our friend can come up with a substitute.\n* [[Fava beans]].  [[Broad beans]] in pods are not often available, so most of the year, it would have to be frozen and I presume we should allow for that when giving a weight.\n\n\n''Thank you to our Peruvian visitor, Gloria Sebastiani for kindly providing this recipe''\n<span class=\"review\">\n<span class=\"reviewHeader\">\n====Best recipe review====\n</span>\n''<span class=\"reviewTitle\">Not able to try this out</span>''\n\n<span style=\"line-height:180%\"><span style=\"font-size:180%;\"><span class=\"reviewScore\">2.5</span>/5 </span>\n\n<span class=\"reviewDesc\">Nowhere near me I can dig a fire pit to do this.
