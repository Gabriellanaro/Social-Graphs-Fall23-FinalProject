Fill up with water, add 1,5 [[Tea|tea]] spoons of [[Salt|salt]]. Cook 1-1,5 hours until soft. Pour the water away and let cool into room temperature. If in hurry, use cold water to cool it.\n* Cook the [[Rice|rice]] according to instructions in the package. Let cool into room temperature. If in hurry, use cold water to cool the rice.\n\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| Put the [[Oven|oven]] on, 200 [[Degrees|degrees]] C\n| In a very large bowl, mix together the [[Cabbage|cabbage]], the [[Rice|rice]] and the uncooked, [[Minced meat|minced meat]]. None of the ingredients should be hot.\n| Mix together the [[Milk|milk]], 3 [[Tea|tea]] spoons of [[Salt|salt]], the [[Pepper|pepper]] and the syrup. Add the mixture to the [[Cabbage|cabbage]], [[Rice|rice]] and [[Minced meat|minced meat]]. Mix everything evenly.\n| Put the mixture into [[Oven|oven]] pots and into the oven. Use several pots to obtain max 10 cm thick layers of the mixture in each pot. [[Bake]] them for 1,5 hours or until very soft.\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nThis dish is traditionally served with [[Lingonberry|lingonberry]] [[Jam|jam]].\n===Recipe source===\n\n* My mother-in-law makes this dish to a perfection, and my husband has adopted it from her.\n===Variations===\nMany people make this dish using pre-[[Fried|fried]] [[Minced meat|minced meat]], adding more syrup and with a shorter cooking time. They also would add more liquid to the [[Stew|stew]]. It is tasty also that way, but has a bit different nature then.\n\nYou can adjust the relative amounts of [[Cabbage|cabbage]], [[Rice|rice]] and [[Meat|meat]] to suit your taste.\n\nYou could substitute the [[Rice|rice]] with another [[Grain|grain]] and adjust the preparation cooking time accordingly. The traditional Finnish [[Ingredient|ingredient]] used before rice arrived into the country would be [[Barley|barley]] [[Grains|grains]], whole or crushed.\n===Chef's notes===\nBe prepared to endure the smell of cooked [[Cabbage|cabbage]] - this clearly is no dish to prepare for important visitors. But for an ordinary family meal this is nutritious, healthy and delicious.\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes|Cabbage]]\n[[Category:Finnish recipes|Cabbage]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes|Cabbage]]\n[[Category:Rice recipes|Cabbage]]\n[[Category:Vegetable recipes|Cabbage]]\n[[Category:Stews and casseroles|Cabbage]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted|Cabbage]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#cabbage #rice #mincedmeat #tea #ground #stew #whitepepper #degrees #miseenplace #lingonberry #grain </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
