It is essentially a stew prepared with beef [[Braised|braised]] in a full bodied [[Red wine|red wine]] and [[Beef stock|beef stock]], generally flavoured with [[Garlic|garlic]], [[Onions|onions]], [[Carrots|carrots]], and a [[Bouquet garni|bouquet garni]], and garnished with pearl [[Onions|onions]] and [[Mushrooms|mushrooms]].\n\nThis is my interpretation of this wonderful dish.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 3 tablespoons [[Olive oil]]\n| 400 g [[Stewing]] [[Steak|steak]], trimmed of excess [[Fat|fat]] and cut into bite-sized cubes\n}}\n\n'''Marinade'''\n* 2 sticks of [[Celery|celery]], cut into large pieces (they will be discarded later)\n* 1 large [[Onion|onion]], peeled and quartered (will be discarded later)\n* 2 large [[Carrots|carrots]], sliced in half length-wise (these will be discarded later)\n* 750 ml robust [[Red wine|red wine]] such as Bulls blood. \n\n''' [[Bouquet garni]]''' (I used a variation on version 4)\n* 2 [[Bay leaf|bay leaves]]\n* half a lime (unsqueezed)\n* 1 sprig of [[Oregano|oregano]]\n* 1 sprig of [[Parsley|parsley]]\n* 1 sprig of [[Thyme|thyme]]\n* 3 [[Garlic|garlic]] cloves, bruised\n* 1 strip of [[Lime|lime]] peel\n\n'''Cooking the meat'''\n* 8 [[shallots]] or baby [[onions]]\n* About 100g to 150g of [[button mushrooms]] - ''1 small packet''\n* 2 [[carrots]], scrubbed and sliced\n* 110 g (4 oz) [[home smoked bacon]] or good quality smoked [[bacon]]\n* 3 tablespoons of [[brandy]]\n* Pinch of salt\n* 2 tablespoons of flour\n\n\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a large pan. Add the onion quarters. carrots, celery and fry until the onion is softened.\n| Add the bottle of [[wine]], [[bouquet garni]] and bring to the boil.  Reduce the heat and simmer for 15 minutes.\n| Remove from the heat, allow to cool completely.\n| Arrange the steak in a bowl and pour the wine together with the vegetables over the steak and store in a [[refrigerator]] overnight to [[marinate]].\n| The next day, preheat the oven to 140\u00b0 C (275\u00b0 F - gas 1) \n| Drain the wine and reserve, pick out the meat and reserve, discard the remaining items.\n| In a large [[Dutch oven]], heat the remaining 2 tablespoons of olive and fry the bacon and onions for 3 minutes, add the carrots and mushrooms and fry for a further 3 minutes.\n| Pour in a splash of brandy and deglaze the pan.\n| Stir in the flour.\n| Pour in the reserved wine, add the meat and mix well and bring to the boil.\n| Remove from the hob, cover, place in the oven and cook for 2 hours.\n}}\n===Serving suggestion===\n\nOften served with [[noodles]], was also good with [[squash mash]] and garden peas. Also good with [[mashed potatoes]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Beef bourguignon (slow cooker recipe)]]\n* [[Boeuf bourguignon]]\n* [[Beef bourguignon recipe]]\n* [[Beef bourguignon recipe (PC)]]\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Beef recipes]]\n[[Category:Historic recipes]]\n[[Category:French recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:Stews and casseroles]]\n[[Category:Cooking with wine]]\n[[Category:Favourite recipes]]\n[[Category:Stewed, braised or pot roasted]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#carrots #bouquetgarni #beefbourguignonrecipe #onions #garlic #redwine #wine #buttonmushrooms #marinate #oregano #celery </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
