It was inspired by [[Biarritz potatoes]] and uses similar regional ingredients.  Having said that, and being a regular visitor to the area, I would say that [[Duck|duck]] rather than [[Pork|pork]] would probably be the [[Meat|meat]] of choice for this area.  Anyway, it was a very nice omelette\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| [[Olive oil]] for [[Frying|frying]]\n| 1 [[Red pepper|red pepper]], [[Roasted|roasted]]\n| 200g Good quality cooked [[Ham|ham]] or [[Gammon|gammon]], chopped\n| 4 [[Fresh eggs|fresh eggs]]\n| [[Sea Salt|sea salt]] and [[Freshly ground black pepper|freshly ground black pepper]]\n\n}}\n\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n* [[Roast]] the [[Red pepper|red pepper]], de-[[Seed|seed]] and rub most of the skin off, leaving a little of the burn skin for flavour.\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Chop the [[Roasted red pepper|roasted red pepper]] and [[Ham|ham]]\n| Beat the [[Eggs|eggs]] and add a pinch of [[Salt|salt]]\n| ''Make 1 [[Omelette|omelette]] per person''\n| Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a large [[Frying pan|frying pan]] over a medium heat\n| Add a grind of [[black pepper]]\n| Pour in the [[Egg|egg]] mix and swirl the pan to distribute evenly\n| Cook for a few minutes on one side only\n| Once the edges start to solidify, tip in the [[Ham|ham]] and [[Red peppers|red peppers]], the centre of the [[Omelette|omelette]] should still be a little runny, see the picture\n| Serve immediately by tipping it onto a warmed serving plate, folding it on top of itself\n| By the time it gets to the table the 'runny' part will be perfectly cooked.\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe with [[Chips|chips]] and [[Beans|beans]].\n===Chef's notes===\nFollow the [[RSPCA Think Pig Checklist]] to make sure that your [[Pork|pork]] has come from pigs that have been reared to higher welfare standards.\n* http://bit.ly/rspcathinkpig\n==See also==\n* [[Biarritz potatoes]]\n\n{{OmeletteRecipes}}\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:French recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Snacks and light bites]]\n[[Category:Egg recipes]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:Pork recipes]]\n[[Category:Pan fried]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#biarritzomelette #ham #omelette #pork #redpepper #biarritzpotatoes #seed #oliveoil #blackpepper #redpeppers #gammon </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
