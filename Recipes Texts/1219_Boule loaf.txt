The method, however, is different as a delayed fermentation method is used and you need to start it a day or two in advance.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 250g strong plain [[Bread|bread]] [[Flour|flour]] (I used '''[[Wessexmill.co.uk|Wessex Mill's]]''' [[French bread]] [[flour]])\n| 250g hard [[Durum wheat|durum wheat]] [[Flour|flour]] (for [[Pasta|pasta]])\n| 1 teaspoon [[Salt|salt]] \n| 2 teaspoons easy-[[Bake|bake]] [[Yeast|yeast]]\n| 275ml cold water\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Mix all the ingredients together and [[Kneading bread|knead]] using your hands or a [[Mixer|mixer]] with a [[Dough|dough]] hook. \n| Place in a bowl and cover with lightly oiled [[Cling film|cling film]]. \n| Put the bowl in the [[Fridge|fridge]] for 12-48 hours, to allow the [[Dough|dough]] to rise slowly.\n| Remove from the [[Fridge|fridge]] a few hours before you want to use it.\n| When it has doubled in height from the original size, simply place the [[Dough|dough]] on a lightly floured surface, and work your way around the edge, tucking in each edge in turn into the middle. \n| Handle it gently and do not knock it back first.\n| Once you have a roughly circular shape, squeeze the gathered edges together to produce a taut surface around the rest of the boule. \n| Turn it over onto a piece of [[greaseproof paper]] so that the squeezed seam is on the bottom of the loaf. \n| Cover it with oiled [[Clingfilm|clingfilm]]/[[Plastic wrap|plastic wrap]], and leave to prove at warm room temperature until approximately doubled in height.\n| Preheat the [[Oven|oven]], with a with a [[Semolina|semolina]] dusted [[Baking|baking]] stone or sheet placed on a middle shelf and a deep [[Roasting|roasting]] tin on the oven floor, to 230\u00b0 C (450\u00b0 F - gas 8). \n| Just before you put the loaf into the [[Oven|oven]], pour some [[Boiling|boiling]] water into the preheated [[Roasting|roasting]] tin to provide some [[Steam|steam]]. \n| Remove the [[clingfilm]] and slide the loaf using a [[Semolina|semolina]] dusted [[Bread|bread]] paddle onto the hot stone. \n| After 10 minutes, lower the heat to 220\u00b0 C (425\u00b0 F - gas 7)  and turn the loaf round so it bakes evenly. It should be done in around 25 - 30 minutes, but check it after 20. \n| If it sounds hollow when you knock the bottom of the loaf, it is ready.\n| Leave the loaf on a wire rack to cool completely.\n}}\n===Chef's notes===\nBecause this recipe uses a long [[Fermentation|fermentation]] process, it is not really suitable for [[Breadmakers|breadmakers]].  You can try it (for mixing and kneading), following your manufacturer's instructions regarding the order of adding the ingredients to the machine, but the end result will not be the same.\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:French recipes]]\n[[Category:Accompaniments]]\n[[Category:Bread and baking]]\n[[Category:Vegan recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes]][[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#dough #bouleloaf #clingfilm #flour #fridge #semolina #roasting #bread #yeast #baking #steam </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
