Perhaps this picture will remind me next time!]]\nI made a couple of these for my mum today, so she has a vegetarian alternative for Christmas dinner.\n\nIt's just a slight variation of all of the flan recipes, but they looked so good I though I would add the recipe.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 500 g pack of [[Ready made shortcrust pastry|ready made shortcrust pastry]]\n| [[Olive oil]] for greasing\n| 4 [[Free range eggs|free range eggs]]\n| 8 tablespoons [[Milk|milk]]\n| &#190; of 1 small head of [[Broccoli|broccoli]], cut into small florets\n| 100g baby [[Asparagus|asparagus]] tips, [1 small pack]\n| 200 g of low-[[Fat|fat]] [[Cream cheese|cream cheese]] - mine was [[Chive|chive]] and [[Onion|onion]] flavoured but that's personal taste\n| A splash of [[Louisiana hot pepper sauce]]\n| A handful of freshly chopped [[Parsley|parsley]]\n| [[Freshly ground black pepper]]\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Preheat the oven to 200\u00b0 C (400\u00b0 F - Gas 6)\n| On a floured board, roll out the pastry to fit your [[baking tray]]s\n| Lightly [[Oil|oil]] the trays to prevent the pastry sticking\n| Press the pastry well into the edges of the trays\n| Blind [[Bake|bake]] for 10 minutes\n| Add the [[Broccoli florets|broccoli florets]] to a pan of [[Boiling|boiling]] [[Salted|salted]] water and [[Blanche|blanche]] for about 4 minutes. Remove and drain well\n| Add the [[Eggs|eggs]], [[Milk|milk]], [[Pepper|pepper]], hot [[Sauce|sauce]] and [[Parsley|parsley]] to a large bowl and whisk until combined\n| Add the [[Cream cheese|cream cheese]] and whisk until really well mixed\n| Arrange the florets in the partially [[Baked|baked]] flans and pour in the [[Egg|egg]] mix\n| Arrange the [[Asparagus|asparagus]] tips over the top of the flan\n| [[Bake]] for 30 minutes\n}}\n===Chef's tip===\nBecause I use an electric whisk, I guess lots of air gets into the flans, so they often rise like souffl\u00e9s, to at least double the height of the tin.  bearing this in mind, ensure you leave enough  room above the flan when [[Baking|baking]]! \n{{Quiche - See also}}\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Cheese recipes]]\n[[Category:Egg recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Pies tarts and flans]]\n[[Category:Starters]]\n[[Category:Vegetable recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#asparagusandbroccoliflan #parsley #creamcheese #asparagus #bake #fat #greaseproofpaper #blanche #salted #egg #bakingtray </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
