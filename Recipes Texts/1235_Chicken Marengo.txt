The chef cut up the chicken (reportedly with a sabre) and [[fried]] it in [[olive oil]], made a [[sauce]] from the [[tomatoes]], [[Garlic|garlic]] and [[onions]] (plus a bit of cognac from Napoleon's flask), cooked the crayfish, fried the [[eggs]] and served them as a garnish, with some of the soldier's [[bread]] ration on the side. Napoleon reportedly liked the dish and (having won the battle) considered it lucky. He refused to have the ingredients altered on future occasions even when his chef tried to omit the crayfish.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 1 cup [[crayfish]] tails\n| 1.2kg whole [[chicken]], jointed\n| 1 large [[onion]], peeled and chopped\n| 1 [[clove]] of [[Garlic|garlic]], crushed\n| 6 [[tomatoes]], chopped or 1 small can of [[tomatoes]], chopped\n| 6 tablespoons [[brandy]] or [[dry sherry]]\n| 2 tablespoons [[plain flour]]\n| [[Salt]] and [[freshly ground black pepper]] to taste\n| Handful of torn [[basil leaves]]\n| 3 tablespoons [[black olives]]\n| 2 Free range [[eggs]] to garnish -(optional but authentic!) \n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| [[Parson's nose|Remove the parson's nose]]\n| [[Joint the chicken]]\n| Season the [[flour]] with [[salt]] and [[pepper]] and roll the [[chicken]] pieces in the [[flour]] \n| In a large pot, heat the [[olive oil]] and brown the [[chicken]] pieces, reserve and keep warm\n| Add the [[onion]] and [[Garlic|garlic]] (and a little more [[olive oil]] if needed) and soften the [[onions]]\n| Add the [[chicken]] back to the pan and add the [[tomatoes]] and [[brandy]], cover and [[simmer]] on a low heat for 30 minutes\n| Add the [[crayfish]] tails and [[simmer]] for a further 10 minutes\n| At the last minutes, stir in the [[basil leaves]] and [[olives]]\n| [[Fry]] the [[eggs]] and serve as a garnish with the finished dish\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\n\nTo win all of your battles, serve with crusty [[bread]] or [[boiled potatoes]]\n==See also==\n* {{See also - Jointing a chicken}}\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Historic recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:Poultry recipes]]\n[[Category:French recipes]]\n[[Category:Boiled or simmered]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#chicken #tomatoes #oliveoil #eggs #garlic #onions #chickenmarengo #crayfish #basilleaves #simmer #onion </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
