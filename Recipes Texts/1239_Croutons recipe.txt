Ideally from un-sliced [[White bread|white bread]], though [[Brown bread|brown bread]] makes an interesting change.  They are probably better made with stale [[Bread|bread]].\n\nThey can be made in an [[Oven|oven]], but I find a heavy based [[Frying|frying]]-pan to be just as good, and a little quicker.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| About 175 g (6 oz) of stale [[Bread|bread]] - crusts removed\n| 2 to 3 tablespoons of [[Olive oil|olive oil]]\n| 1 tablespoon [[Butter|butter]]\n| Fine [[Table salt|table salt]]\n| 1 clove of [[Garlic|garlic]], peeled and [[Grated|grated]] (optional)\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Remove the crusts and cut the [[Bread|bread]] into cubes\n| Heat the [[Oil|oil]] and [[Butter|butter]] in the pan until frothing\n| Add the [[Garlic|garlic]] if using and [[Fry|fry]] for 25 seconds\n| Toss in the [[Croutons|croutons]] and jiggle the pan so the [[Oil|oil]] is evenly distributed and [[Fry|fry]] until golden [[Brown|brown]]\n| Sprinkle with a little [[Salt|salt]] and serve.\n| They will keep if stored in an airtight container, but they are so quick and simple to make it's probably easier to make them as you need them.\n}}\n===Variations===\nIf , like me you prefer you [[Croutons|croutons]] drier, just use half the [[Oil|oil]] and [[Butter|butter]].  They are just as nice.\n\nShould you want to cook them in the oven, preheat to 180\u00b0C (gas mark 4 / 350\u00b0F), using a bowl, toss them in just oil, spread out on a baking sheet and bake for about 10 minutes.  They could also be done under a grill, but watch them closely or they will burn!\n===Chef's notes===\nAs a rough guide, 1 bread roll makes enough croutons for 2 people; [[ciabatta]] rolls make really nice croutons.\n\n{{Template:Croutons recipes}}\n\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Accompaniments]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Bread and baking]]\n[[Category:French recipes]]\n[[Category:Salad recipes]]\n[[Category:Soup and stock recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes]]\n[[Category:Pan fried]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#croutonsrecipe #bread #butter #fry #garlic #croutons #tablesalt #soups #brownbread #whitebread #ciabatta </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
