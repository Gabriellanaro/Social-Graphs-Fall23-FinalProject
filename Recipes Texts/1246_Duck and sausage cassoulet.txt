Jamie and Hugh are great but after that you need to go back to Floyd and Fanny to keep me happy.  However, things changed last week when I  saw the Fabulous Baker Brothers [Channel 4 UK].  Fresh lively presentation with relatively complex food, simply explained and cooked. I am a convert.  \n\nCassoulet is typical of [[Aquitaine]], South West [[France]], though can probably be found throughout Southern France.  In French shops and markets you would find the [[Beans|beans]] in [[Kilner]]-type jars, sealed with a layer of [[Duck fat|duck fat]] rather than being sold in tins.\n\nI have adjusted the quantities, cooking temperatures and times from both the tv program and the Channel 4 recipe, see [[Talk:Duck and sausage cassoulet| the comments page]] for my reasons.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| [[Olive oil]]\n| 6 [[Toulouse sausages]] (about 400g)\n| 4 [[Duck|duck]] legs\n| 6 rashers of [[Pancetta|pancetta]]\n| 2 x 400g cans of peeled [[Plum tomatoes|plum tomatoes]], chopped\n| 1 bulb of [[Garlic|garlic]], unpeeled and cut in two\n|* ''When I cut my bulb in two, a lot of the outer skin came away so I actually removed most of it.''\n| 2 medium [[Red onions|red onions]], peeled and thinly sliced\n| 1 large [[Red chilli|red chilli]], slit lengthwise\n| 3 sprigs of [[Thyme|thyme]]\n| [[Sea Salt|sea salt]] and [[Freshly ground black pepper|freshly ground black pepper]]\n| 500 ml [[Chicken stock|chicken stock]]\n| A good splash of [[White wine|white wine]]\n| 2 x 400g cans [[Cannellini beans|cannellini beans]], well rinsed in cold water and drained\n| 2 tablespoons of [[Sherry vinegar|sherry vinegar]]\n| 1 [[French baguette]], torn into small pieces\n\n}}\n\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n* Preheat the oven to 200\u00b0 C (400\u00b0 F - gas 6), [fan oven 180\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:The Fabulous Baker Brothers cassoulet pre bread.jpg|The Fabulous Baker Brothers cassoulet, ready for the bread\nImage:The Fabulous Baker Brothers cassoulet tight fit.jpg|This is the largest roasting tray I have and I could only get 400 ml of stock in it!\nImage:The Fabulous Baker Brothers cassoulet fryin tray.jpg|Use the roasting tray like a huge frying pan\nImage:The Fabulous Baker Brothers cassoulet ingredients.jpg|The ingredients\n</gallery>\n\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Pour a splash of olive oil into a large roasting pan on a hob at a high heat.  Add a grind of [[black pepper]], add the duck and sausages and use it like a huge frying pan to brown the meat.  This may take 10 to 15 minutes.\n| Remove the browned meat and set to one side.\n|Slit the chilli length-wise but don't disturb the seeds.\n| With the heat still on, add the herbs, chilli, onions, pancetta, garlic bulb halves, cut side down.  Season with salt and pepper and fry for 5 minutes, stirring now and then.\n| [[De-glaze]] the pan with the wine and the sherry vinegar.\n| Add the beans and chopped tomatoes and mix well.\n| Arrange the duck and sausages on the top, duck skin-side up.  Pour over the chicken stock and jiggle the roasting tray to bed everything down.\n| Roast uncovered for 1.5 hours, checking a few times to see that it's not drying out. ''see [[Talk:Duck and sausage cassoulet|comments]]''\n| After 1.5 hours, tear the baguette into small pieces and push into the tray so that the bread soaks up all the fat and juices.\n| Return to the oven and roast for 30 minutes more.\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nOn the TV program they suggested serving with a green salad. I'm not sure that would work very well. We found it fine on its own, though it might be nice with some boiled broccoli.\n===Variations===\n* Instead of [[pancetta]], use 200 g [[dry cured bacon]] or [[lardons]]\n* Use dry [[Sherry|sherry]] or even [[red wine]] instead of [[white wine]]\n* Use 1 cup (450g / 1lb) dried cannellini beans though they will need soaking overnight, rinsing and boiling in unsalted water for 1 to 1.5 hours before they can be added at the same stage as the canned beans.\n* I added a few ''interesting'' [[dried chillies]] instead of the large fresh red chilli.\n* My fresh thyme is a little past its best so I made a [[bouquet garni]] of some [[thyme]], [[bay leaves]] and a little [[cutting celery]]\n==See also==\n* [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:English_television_chefs Television chefs (Wikipedia)]\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:French recipes]]\n[[Category:Historic recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Spicy recipes]]\n[[Category:Chilli pepper recipes]]\n[[Category:Garlic recipes]]\n[[Category:Grain and bean recipes]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:Pork recipes]]\n[[Category:Poultry recipes]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#duckandsausagecassoulet #pancetta #thyme #whitewine #driedchillies #lardons #sherry #kilner #plumtomatoes #unusualrecipes #redwine </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
