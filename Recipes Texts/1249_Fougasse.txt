This is based on a recipe in  Richard Berthinet's '''[[Dough]]''' (ISBN 9781856267625).  I have started by making an overnight sponge, to encourage [[Yeast|yeast]] activity, but you can omit that stage if you like and mix in all the ingredients at the same time.   Excellent [[Bread|bread]] for tearing and dunking.\n\nSee 'Variations' below for instructions on how to partially make this in a [[Breadmaker|breadmaker]].\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 10g fresh [[Yeast|yeast]]\n| 350g [[Sparkling mineral water|sparkling mineral water]]\n| 500g strong [[Bread|bread]] [[Flour|flour]] - you may need to use more water if using very strong bread [[Flour|flour]]\n| 10g [[Salt|salt]]\n| [[Polenta]] for dusting\n\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| The night before you want to [[Bake|bake]] the [[Bread|bread]], dissolve the [[Yeast|yeast]] in the water,\n| [[Sieve]] 250g [[Flour|flour]] into a large bowl and stir in the water and dissolved [[Yeast|yeast]]. Do NOT add the [[Salt|salt]] at this stage as its will interfere with yeast activity.\n| Mix thoroughly.\n| Cover with [[Clingfilm|clingfilm]] and leave at room temperature overnight.\n| If it becomes very active, [[Refrigerate|refrigerate]] and bring to room temperature in the morning.\n| The next day, [[Sieve|sieve]] the remaining 250g [[Flour|flour]] with the [[Salt|salt]] and add to the bowl.\n| Mix thoroughly and leave to rest for 20 minutes. \n| The [[Dough|dough]] should be fairly sticky, so add more water if necessary. \n| [[Knead]], using your desired method until you have an elastic [[Dough|dough]]. \n| Shape into a ball and leave it to rest for an hour in an oiled bowl, covered with [[Clingfilm|clingfilm]], until the [[Dough|dough]] has almost doubled in size.\n| Lightly [[Flour|flour]] a work surface with the [[polenta]] and gently deflate the [[Dough|dough]].  \n| [[Knead]] briefly and repeat the two previous steps, but do not vigorously deflate the [[Dough|dough]].\n| Divide into 4 equal pieces and shape into rectangles.\n| Make a large diagonal cut from the top right to the bottom left corner, without cutting into the corners.\n| Make at 3 or 4 diagonal cuts on each side of the first cut, again, without cutting right through to the edge.\n| Using your fingers, open the cuts right out.\n| Make sure the holes as are large as they will close up during [[Baking|baking]] and could converge ~(as mine did - see image above).\n| Slide onto a floured peel and then onto your [[Baking stone|baking stone]] or a floured [[Baking|baking]] sheet.\n| [[Bake]] at 230\u00b0 C (450\u00b0 F - gas 8), [fan [[Oven|oven]] 210\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour] for 10-15 minutes until golden [[Brown|brown]].\n| Allow to cool on a wire rack.\n}}\n===Chef's notes===\nYou can do stages 6-12 in a [[Breadmaker|breadmaker]], using the longest [[Dough|dough]] setting.   If you not making a sponge, then you can just add all the ingredients to the machine at the beginning.  You will also need to use just under a sachet of fast-action [[yeast]].\nFor the Panasonic SD253 breadmaker, use the French dough setting,  for the [[Panasonic SD-ZB2502 automatic breadmaker]], use menu potion 08 French dough setting.\nPanasonic SD-ZB2502 automatic breadmaker\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:French recipes]]\n[[Category:Bread and baking]]\n[[Category:Vegan recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes]]\n[[Category:Breadmaker recipes]][[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#dough #yeast #flour #fougasse #bread #bake #baking #sieve #polenta #clingfilm #knead </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
