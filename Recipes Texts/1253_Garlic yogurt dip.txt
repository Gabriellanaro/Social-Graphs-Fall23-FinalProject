It's quite [[Garlic|garlic]]y but you'll probably know how much garlic is ''too much'' for you!\n\nIt only takes a few minutes to prepare, but is improved if left for a few hours for the flavours to minge, especially if you're out of season and using [[Dried|dried]] [[Parsley|parsley]].\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| 3 [[Cloves of Garlic, peeled and crushed|cloves of garlic, peeled and crushed]]\n| Pinch of [[Black pepper|black pepper]] - see [[Chef's notes]]\n| Pinch of pink seas [[Salt|salt]]\n| 6 good tablespoons of full-frat [[Greek yogurt]] (160 g)\n| &#189; teaspoon [[Dried|dried]] [[Parsley|parsley]]\n}}\n\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| Add [[Garlic|garlic]], [[Ground black pepper|ground black pepper]] and [[Sea Salt|sea salt]] to a bowl\n| Mix well with the back of a spoon\n| Stir in the [[Yogurt|yogurt]] and optional [[Dried|dried]] [[Parsley|parsley]]\n| Mix well and leave to stand for a few hours if you have the time\n}}\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Garlic yogurt dip - ready to stand for 2 hours.jpg|Garlic dip, ready to stand for a few hours so the flavours can develop\nImage:Garlic yogurt dip - dried parsley added.jpg|A sprinkle of dried parsley will be re-hydrated in an hour or so\nImage:Garlic yogurt dip - spice ingredients.jpg|Garlic dip, the basic ingredients\n</gallery>\n\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe as a [[Dip|dip]] for [[Chips|chips]] and [[Vegetables|vegetables]]\n===Chef's notes===\nI pre-grind my ''special-mix'' [[black pepper]] and store in a covered bowl so it's easy to add a pinch, rather than having to grind it fresh each time. My special mix is 65% black peppercorns and 35% Szechuan peppercorns.\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:French recipes]]\n[[Category:Accompaniments]]\n[[Category:Dips and sauces]]\n[[Category:Marinades dressings and butters]]\n[[Category:Snacks and light bites]]\n[[Category:Tapas, mezze and antipasti]]\n[[Category:Vegan recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes]]\n[[Category:Garlic recipes]]\n[[Category:uncooked]]\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:12032020'>#garlicyogurtdip #parsley #dried #vegetables #chips #dip #garlic #blackpepperspecialmix #recipes #groundblackpepper #chefsnotes</code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
