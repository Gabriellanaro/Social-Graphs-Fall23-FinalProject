They can be made on the [[Croutons recipe|hob, in a frying pan]], but I've found the best results are achieved if you make them in the [[Oven|oven]] as they get a nice even crisp and you don't have to fiddle about with them too much.\n\nThe [[Croutons|croutons]] will stay nice and crispy for at least a month if kept in a [[Lock and Lock]] style box once they have been allowed to cool down.\n\n[[French]] [[Baguettes|baguettes]] make the best [[Croutons|croutons]], but I've yet to find a decent [[Baguette|baguette]] outside [[France]].  [[Ciabatta bread]] or rolls have a similar texture and give very good results.\n\nTwo [[Ciabatta|ciabatta]] rolls make enough to garnish a [[Salad|salad]] for eight people.\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| 2 [[Ciabatta|ciabatta]] rolls\n| A good splash of [[Olive oil|olive oil]]\n| A shake of [[Mixed herbs|mixed herbs]]\n| Fine [[Sea Salt|sea salt]]\n}}\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n\n* Preheat the [[Oven|oven]] to 190\u00b0 C (375\u00b0 F - gas 5).
