I made this using a Pansasonic SD-255.  Start making the [[bread]] the day before you wish to eat it.\n\n\n'''Mother [[Dough|dough]]'''\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 380 g [[French bread]] [[Flour|flour]] or [[Strong white flour|strong white flour]]\n| 100 g wholewheat [[Rye flour|rye flour]]\n| 325 ml water - or by weight instead of volume, 325 g water\n| 5 g Easy Blend [[Dried yeast|dried yeast]]\n| 8 g [[Salt|salt]]\n}}\n'''[[Bread]] [[Dough|dough]]'''\n{{RecipeIngredientsNB\n| 260 g [[French bread]] [[Flour|flour]] or [[Strong white flour|strong white flour]]\n| 55 g wholewheat [[Rye flour|rye flour]]\n| 175 ml water - or by weight instead of volume, 175g water\n| 4 g Easy Blend [[Dried yeast|dried yeast]]\n| 4 g [[Salt|salt]]\n}}\n===Method===\n\n\n'''The mother [[Dough|dough]] is made first.'''\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Add the mother [[Dough|dough]] ingredients to the pan of your [[Breadmaker|breadmaker]] in the order specified in the manufacturer's instructions.\n| If the [[Breadmaker|breadmaker]] has a [[French bread]] [[Dough|dough]] only setting, use that.  If it does not, then use the longest dough programme available.  For the [[Panasonic SD-ZB2502 automatic breadmaker]] this is menu option 21, French dough.\n| Allow the [[Dough|dough]] to rise in the pan for a minimum of 6 hours in the [[breadmaker]] or place it overnight in a [[Fridge|fridge]], in which case, remove from the fridge 2 hours before making the [[Bread|bread]] dough.  \n}}\n'''We now make the [[Bread|bread]] [[Dough|dough]]'''\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Add the [[Bread|bread]] [[Dough|dough]] ingredients to the mother dough in the [[Breadmaker|breadmaker]] and set to the same programme that you used for the mother dough.\n| Allow the [[Dough|dough]] to rise until double its size.\n| Remove from the [[Breadmaker|breadmaker]] and place on a floured board.\n| Knead and divide the mixture into two or three equal parts and shape as desired. \n| Place the loaves on [[Baking|baking]] tins, cover and leave again until doubled in size.\n| Meanwhile, preheat the [[Oven|oven]] at the highest temperature and at the same time place a bowl or tray of water on the bottom.\n| When the loaves have risen, put them in the [[Oven|oven]] and immediately reduce the temperature to 220\u00b0 C (425\u00b0 F - gas 7).\n| Should the loaves become too [[Brown|brown]] during [[Baking|baking]], cover them with [[Tin foil|tin foil]].\n| Allow to [[Bake|bake]] for 30-35 minutes, remove from [[Oven|oven]] and allow to cool on a cake rack.\n}}\n===Variations===\nTry substituting the [[Rye flour|rye flour]] with [[Spelt|spelt]], [[Kamut|kamut]] or any other [[Flours|flours]].  \n\nIf you want to bake the whole thing in the [[breadmaker]], reduce the ingredients by a third or a half and follow the manufacturer's instructions.\n===Chef's notes===\nYou might feel that this is a long winded way of making [[Bread|bread]], but the idea of having a mother [[Dough|dough]] is to improve the flavour and texture of the bread.  It also improves its keeping qualities.\n\nAlso, please ensure that you use the correct quantity of [[rye flour]] as it absorbs more water than ordinary [[strong white flour|bread flour]].\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes|Pain de campagne (country bread)]]\n[[Category:Bread and baking|Pain de campagne (country bread)]]\n[[Category:Breadmaker recipes|Pain de campagne (country bread)]]\n[[Category:French recipes|Pain de campagne (country bread)]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes|Pain de campagne (country bread)]]\n[[Category:Vegan recipes]][[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#dough #breadmaker #bread #ryeflour #frenchbread #strongwhiteflour #baking #driedyeast #flour #tinfoil #flours </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
