Some more modern versions of the recipe include [[Grated|grated]] [[Parmesan|parmesan]], [[Pecorino|pecorino]] or similar hard [[Cheeses|cheeses]]. Traditionally, the ingredients are crushed and mixed together in a mortar with a pestle, (pistou means pounded in the French Proven\u00e7al language). The word \"Pistou\" is an introduction from Genoa dialect \"[[Pesto]]\" as it has been brought in Provence in 19 th century by Italian immigrants from Genoa and Ligury ( 30 % of Provence population are of italian origin).\n===Pistou & Pesto===\nThe key difference between pistou and [[pesto]] is the absence of pinoli ([[Pine nuts|pine nuts]]), from pistou.\n===Pistou: uses===\nIt is a typical [[Condiment|condiment]] from the Provence region of [[France]] and from [[Italian]] regions that can be served with [[Pasta dishes|pasta dishes]] or as a spread for [[Bread|bread]].\n\nIt is most often associated with the Proven\u00e7al dish [[soupe au pistou]] or minestrone al pesto (Ligury)\nBoth pistou and [[Pesto|pesto]] probably share the same origins. The Roman poet Virgil describes a [[Sauce|sauce]] of crushed [[Herbs|herbs]], [[Garlic|garlic]], [[Salt|salt]], and [[Olive oil|olive oil]].  A version with pinoli emerged around Genoa to become pesto, while pistou evolved in the areas around Nice.\n\nSome regions, especially those closer to the Alps, substitute [[Swiss cheese]] in the place of [[Parmesan]]. Whatever [[Cheese|cheese]] is used, it is preferred that it not be a \"stringy\" cheese, so that when it melts in a hot liquid (like in the pistou [[Soup|soup]], for instance) it does not melt into long strands.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| A big handful of fresh [[Basil leaves|basil leaves]]\n| 1 [[Fat|fat]] Clove of [[Garlic|garlic]], peeled and crushed\n| 100ml (4fl oz) [[Extra virgin olive oil|extra virgin olive oil]]\n| [[Sea Salt|sea salt]] and [[Freshly ground black pepper|freshly ground black pepper]]\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| [[Blanch]] the [[Basil leaves|basil leaves]] in a pan of [[Boiling|boiling]] water for 5-10 seconds.\n| Drain and rinse under cold water.\n| Drain and carefully press out any excess water.\n| Blitz the [[Garlic|garlic]] and [[Basil|basil]] in a [[Food processor|food processor]] (using the smallest bowl available).\n| Blend to a pur\u00e9e, adding the [[Olive oil|olive oil]], slowly, a little at a time.\n| Season to taste.\n| [[Refrigerate|Refrigerate]] in a [[Lock and Lock|lock and lock]]-style container until required.\n}}\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Ingredients]]\n[[Category:Condiments]]\n[[Category:Garlic recipes]]\n[[Category:French recipes]]\n[[Category:Accompaniments]]\n[[Category:Dips and sauces]]\n[[Category:Soup and stock recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegan recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes]]\n[[Category:Uncooked]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#pistousauce #garlic #pesto #oliveoil #sauce #basil #parmesan #basilleaves #cheese #cheeses #herbs </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
