Really good chicken stock.  You probably wont use all of the vegetables and original stock. Just chuck the chicken carcass back into the pot with a little water and a few more vegetables if you have any laying around.  Boil up and simmer for 15 to 20 minutes, allow to cool and then strain and freeze.  I got more than a litre of good chicken stock from this.\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes|Chicken]]\n[[Category:Garlic recipes]]\n[[Category:Historic recipes|Chicken]]\n[[Category:Main courses|Chicken]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes|Chicken]]\n[[Category:Poultry recipes|Chicken]]\n[[Category:Stews and casseroles|Chicken]]\n[[Category:French recipes|Chicken]]\n[[Category:Stewed, braised or pot roasted]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#chicken #potatoes #turnips #stock #boiling #stewedbraisedorpotroasted #garlic #potroasted #celery #boil #garlicmayonnaise </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
