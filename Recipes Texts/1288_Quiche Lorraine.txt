Perhaps this picture will remind me next time!]]\nQuiche Lorraine is perhaps the most common variety of quiche. In addition to the eggs and cream, it includes bacon or lardons.  I know cheese is not really an ingredient of a true Quiche Lorraine, but rather than use double cream, I prefer to use [[mascarpone cheese]] or [[ricotta cheese]], both or more like cream than [[cheese]] and work really well in a savoury flan.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 157 g (6 oz) -half a block of ready-made [[shortcrust pastry]]\n| 3 [[free range eggs]], beaten\n| 45 ml (4 tablespoons) of [[milk]]\n| 3 tablespoons of [[mascarpone cheese]] or [[ricotta cheese]]\n| 5 rashers of cooked [[bacon]], [[home smoked bacon]] or [[ham]], chopped into tiny pieces.\n| [[freshly ground black pepper]]\n| Slices of [[tomato]] or [[red pepper]] or [[green pepper]] or a mixture of all to garnish\n\n}}\n\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n* Preheat the oven to 200\u00b0 C (400\u00b0 F - Gas 6)\n\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Roll the pastry and use it to line a greased 20 cm (8\") [[push-out flan dish]]\n| [[Blind baking|Bake blind]] at 200\u00b0 C (400\u00b0 F - Gas 6) for 10 minutes\n| Beat the [[eggs]], [[milk]], [[mascarpone cheese]] and season to taste with [[pepper]] -  [[salt]] won't be needed with the bacon\n| Stir in the bacon pieces\n| Pour the egg and bacon mixture into the blind-baked flan case\n| Decorate with whatever you have to hand, I used half of a [[green pepper]], sliced, but use whatever you have to hand, [[tomatoes]] look and taste good.\n| Reduce the heat of the oven to 180\u00b0 C (350\u00b0 F - Gas 4)\n| [[Bake]] for a further 40 minutes\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\n\nServe hot or cold\n\n{{Quiche - See also}}\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Starters]]\n[[Category:Egg recipes]]\n[[Category:Pies tarts and flans]]\n[[Category:French recipes]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#quichelorraine #mascarponecheese #bacon #ricottacheese #greenpepper #bake #cheese #greaseproofpaper #freerangeeggs #redpepper #homesmokedbacon </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
