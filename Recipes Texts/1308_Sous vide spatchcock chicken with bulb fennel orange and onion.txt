I've used an [[Orange|orange]] instead of a [[Lemon|lemon]]. As [[Sous vide cooking|sous vide cooking]] tends to intensify the flavours I removed all of the [[Bitter|bitter]] pith by cutting off with the rind and just including a few strips of [[Lemon zest|lemon zest]].\n\n===Not as good as expected===\nThis was inferior to the [[Spatchcocked chicken with fennel and onions|roast version]].  I felt it was overcooked with a mushy mouthfeel. It was still nice, but not worth all the extra effort.\n\nI will redo shortly, leaving the skin on, adding garlic butter and without peeling the orange.  We'll get there in the end!\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| 1.5kg (medium-sized) whole [[Chicken|chicken]]\n| 1 [[Fennel bulb|fennel bulb]], chopped\n| 1 small [[Brown|brown]] [[Onion|onion]], peeled and roughly chopped\n| 1 whole [[Orange|orange]]\n| A pinch of [[Sea Salt|sea salt]] and [[Freshly ground black pepper|freshly ground black pepper]]\n}}\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n\n* Preheat the [[Sous vide bath|sous vide bath]] to 71\u00b0C (''159.8\u00b0F'')\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Sous vide spatchcock chicken with bulb fennel orange and onion cooked.jpg|Cooked chicken breasts removed, ready to plate up\nImage:Sous vide spatchcock chicken with bulb fennel orange and onion bagged.jpg|Vacuum packed and ready to cook\nImage:Sous vide spatchcock chicken with bulb fennel orange and onion.jpg|Spatchcocked and skinned with the basic ingredients\n</gallery>\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| Remove the [[Parson's nose|parson's nose]] and [[Spatchcock|spatchcock]] the [[Chicken|chicken]], skin the chicken and trim and discard as much [[Fat|fat]] as you can.  I've also snipped the wing-tips and removed any obvious stray [[bones]].\n| Season with [[Sea Salt|sea salt]] and [[Freshly ground black pepper|freshly ground black pepper]] and drop into a suitable sized [[Sous-vide|sous-vide]] bag.  My widest bag, cut to 30cm [12\"] was plenty large enough.\n| Remove the core from the [[Fennel bulb|fennel bulb]] and roughly chop.\n| Peel and roughly chop the [[Onion|onion]].\n| Reserve a few strips of [[Zest|zest]] from the [[Orange|orange]], then use a knife to remove the pith and skin. Discard.\n| Quarter the [[Orange|orange]] and add to the bag, together with the [[Zest|zest]], chopped [[Fennel|fennel]] and [[Onion|onion]].\n| [[Vacuum seal]] and cook in a [[Sous vide bath|sous vide bath]] at 71\u00b0C (''159.8\u00b0F'') for 8 hours.\n| I tend to discard the [[Orange|orange]], most of the [[Onion|onion]] and [[Fennel|fennel]], using the remnants and the cooking [[Liquor|liquor]] to flavour the [[Gravy|gravy]]. [[Chicken]] gravy granules is a good [[Cheat|cheat]] for the gravy!\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe with [[Roast potatoes|roast potatoes]] and a [[Green vegetable|green vegetable]].\n===Recipe source===\n\n* Based in [[Spatchcocked chicken with fennel and onions]]\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:French recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Fruit recipes]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:Poultry recipes]]\n[[Category:Sous vide recipes]]\n[[Category:Sous vide cooking]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#orange #sousvidespatchcockchickenwithbulbfennelorangeandonion #onion #chicken #zest #sousvidecooking #sousvidebath #fennelbulb #fennel #gravy #liquor </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
