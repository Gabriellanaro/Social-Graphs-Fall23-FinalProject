Any type will do, a [[Chinese cabbage]] worked well the last time I made this.  \n| 1 packet of young [[spinach]] leaves or [[rocket leaves]], about 225 g (8 oz)\n| A handful of [[chives]], chopped (if in season)\n| '''Dressing'''\n| 3 tablespoons (30 ml) [[olive oil]]\n| 1 tablespoon (15 ml) [[white wine vinegar]]\n| Pinch of [[sugar]]\n| Pinch of [[salt]]\n| Dash of [[lemon juice]]\n| 2 teaspoons (10 ml) American squeezy [[mustard]]\n| 1 teaspoon (5 ml) [[caraway seeds]], crushed in a [[pestle and mortar]]\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Bring the [[potatoes]] to [[boil]] and [[simmer]] for 15 minutes in lightly [[salted]] water\n| Drain, cover and keep warm\n| Hard-[[boil]] the [[eggs]] for 12 minutes, refresh in cold water, peel and cut into quarters\n| With a very sharp knife, make a corkscrew shaped score around [[frankfurters]] from one end to the other\n| Bring to the [[boil]] and [[simmer]] for 5 minutes, drain and keep warm\n| Add the dressing ingredients to a bowl and whisk well until combined.  Alternatively use a salad shaker or a screw-topped jar\n| Mix half of the dressing with the [[spinach]] and [[lettuce]] leaves and the other half with the [[potatoes]] and the [[frankfurters]]\n| Divide the [[salad]] amongst 4 large plates and dress with the [[hard-boiled eggs]]\n| Season to taste and serve immediately\n}}\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Frankfurter salad with red cabbage.jpg|thumb|300px|right|[[Frankfurter]] salad with [[red cabbage]] and crispy [[bacon]]\nImage:Canned frankfurters.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Canned [[frankfurters]]\n</gallery>\n===Variations===\nThe addition of crispy fried [[home-cured bacon]], crumbled over the top was a nice addition.\n\nA serving of [[pickled red cabbage]] was a good accompaniment to this dish.\n\n'''Other ways to cook the frankfurters'''\n* Add the [[frankfurters]] to a plastic bowl together with the brine or an inch of water, cover with a plate or cling-film and microwave on full power for 3 minutes. \n* [[Grill]] or [[barbecue]] for 4 or 5 minutes, turning often.\n===Chef's notes===\n\nMaking this again, I feel that the dressing is nicer using [[wholegrain mustard]] (and more of it), it certainly has more bite!\n\nAs with any salad, chuck in what you have lying around at the time.\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes|Frankfurter]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes|Frankfurter]]\n[[Category:German recipes]]\n[[Category:Salad recipes|Frankfurter]]\n[[Category:Potato recipes]]\n[[Category:Favourite recipes]]\n[[Category:Boiled or simmered]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#frankfurters #potatoes #boil #lettuce #eggs #frankfurtersaladwithmustarddressing #spinach #simmer #salad #barbecue #salted </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
