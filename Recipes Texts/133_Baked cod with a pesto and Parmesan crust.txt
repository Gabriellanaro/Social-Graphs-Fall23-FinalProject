I'm serving it with [[Puy lentils|puy lentils]] in home-grown [[Leeks|leeks]] and [[Garlic|garlic]] with the last of this season's [[Sungold]] [[tomatoes]].\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| 2 [[Cod|cod]] [[Steak|steak]]s of around 250g or once large 500g steak cut in two\n| 5 heaped tablespoons of [[Breadcrumbs|breadcrumbs]]\n| 5 tablespoons freshly [[Grated|grated]] [[Parmesan cheese|parmesan cheese]]\n| 80g [[Pesto|pesto]] - about 3 tablespoons\n| [[Olive oil]]\n| [[Freshly ground black pepper]]\n}}\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n\n* Check and remove any pin-[[bones]] from the [[Cod|cod]] fillets\n* Preheat the [[Oven|oven]] to 180\u00b0 C (350\u00b0 F - gas 4), [fan oven 160\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]\n\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| Put the [[Breadcrumbs|breadcrumbs]] into a bowl and add the [[Grated|grated]] [[Parmesan]] and the [[Pesto|pesto]] together with a tablespoon of [[Olive oil|olive oil]] and a pinch of [[Black pepper|black pepper]] and mix well to combine.\n| Lightly [[Brush|brush]] or [[Spray|spray]] a [[Baking tray|baking tray]] with [[Olive oil|olive oil]] and lay the fillets on the tray skin side down.\n| Spread the top of each one fillet with the [[Breadcrumb|breadcrumb]] mixture.\n| [[Bake]] for 20 minutes and finish under the [[Grill|grill]] for a few minutes for a crispy topping watching it carefully to see it does not burn.\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nI've served it with [[Puy lentils|puy lentils]] dressed with [[Leek|leek]] and [[Garlic|garlic]] [[Sauteed|sauteed]] in [[Olive oil|olive oil]] and  [[Sungold|sungold]] [[Tomatoes|tomatoes]]\n==See also==\n\n* http://www.fishonline.org/fish/cod-atlantic-cod-30\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Cheese recipes]]\n[[Category:Fish recipes]]\n[[Category:Sea fish recipes]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#oliveoil #bakedcodwithapestoandparmesancrust #pesto #puylentils #grated #tomatoes #cod #breadcrumbs #sungold #garlic #breadcrumb </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
