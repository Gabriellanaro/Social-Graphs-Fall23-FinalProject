Frequently the [[aubergine]] is [[baked]] or [[broiled]] over an open flame before peeling, so that the pulp is soft and has a smoky taste.\n\nBaba ghanoush is usually eaten as a dip with [[pita bread]], and is sometimes added to other dishes. It is usually of an earthy light brown colour.\n==A better recipe than this one!==\nAfter a few experiments, I've come up with a recipe that is far superior to the original in my opinion.  It's not too different but the addition of more [[garlic]], frying the garlic and adding the roasted [[red pepper]] makes it more robust and adds a little sweetness too.\n\n* '''[[Baba ghanoush with roasted red pepper]]'''\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 3 [[aubergines]]\n| 4 tablespoons light [[tahini]]\n| 2 [[cloves garlic, peeled and crushed]]\n| 2 tablespoons [[yogurt]]\n| Juice from half a [[lemon]] or [[lime]]\n| [[Salt]] and [[freshly ground black pepper]]\n| [[Olive oil]]\n| 1 teaspoon [[paprika]]\n| 4 [[Pitta breads]] or [[crispbreads]]\n| Handful of crushed [[walnuts]] or [[toasted]] flaked [[almonds]]\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Cook the [[aubergines]] over a hot grill or [[barbecue]]  until the skins are well burnt\n| Turn them regularly\n| You can also impale them on [[skewers]] (better metal than wooden ones) and roast them over the [[barbecue]], again turning often\n| Set them aside to cool\n| Halve them and scoop out the soft flesh\n| Put the flesh into a [[food processor]] together with the [[Garlic|garlic]],  [[yogurt]] and [[tahini]].
