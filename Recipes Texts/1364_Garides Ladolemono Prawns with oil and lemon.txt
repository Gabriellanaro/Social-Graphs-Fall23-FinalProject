It was very nice, even so.\n\nWhen making it again, I would use the largest seafood that you can find or you'll spend most of the time peeling, rather than eating.  Nice though, and the leftover dressing went well with a few more [[salads]].\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes|Prawns with oil and lemon]]\n[[Category:Greek recipes|Prawns with oil and lemon]]\n[[Category:Main courses|Prawns with oil and lemon]]\n[[Category:Shellfish recipes|Prawns with oil and lemon]]\n[[Category:Snacks and light bites|Prawns with oil and lemon]]\n[[Category:Starters|Prawns with oil and lemon]]\n[[Category:Fruit recipes]]\n[[Category:Boiled or simmered]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#juice #oliveoil #onion #lemon #celery #prawns #prawn #dijonmustard #lettuce #unusualrecipes #mustard </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
