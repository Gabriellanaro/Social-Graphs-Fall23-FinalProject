I just love the flavour the combination and the nice crunch they have - so I thought I should try and use this mixture to make a crisp coating for fresh [[Fish|fish]].  Rather than [[Deep fry|deep fry]] or even pan [[Fry|fry]] them, I thought I would [[Bake|bake]] them.\n\nThis worked really well and would be equally good on meaty steaks too.\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| About half a [[Cup|cup]] of mixed [[Cashew nuts|cashew nuts]] and [[Roasted|roasted]] [[Sweet corn|sweet corn]] kernels\n| ''I used Natco Spicy cashew nuts & Natco roasted salted toasted corn - both available from Morrisons (UK)'' \n| A tablespoon of [[Masa Harina|masa harina]] to loosen the mixture when [[Grinding|grinding]] ([[Plain flour|plain flour]] would be fine)\n| 2 medium sized [[Hake|hake]] [[Fillet steaks|fillet steaks]]\n| 2 [[Eggs|eggs]], beaten\n| 3 tablespoons [[Plain flour|plain flour]] for dredging\n}}\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n\n* Preheat your [[Oven|oven]] to 180\u00b0 C (350\u00b0 F - gas 4), [fan oven 160\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Baked hake with crispy cashew and sweetcorn coating station.jpg|The coating station, 1 down, 1 to go\nImage:Crispy cashew and sweetcorn coating.jpg|My stash of munchies, with the amount used in the bowl\nImage:Natoco Spicy Cashew Nuts Natco Toasted Corn.jpg|Natco Roasted and salted toasted corn & Natco Spicy cashew nuts\n</gallery>\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| Add the [[Cashew nuts|cashew nuts]] and [[Sweet corn|sweet corn]] kernels to a [[Food processor|food processor]] with a metal blade\n| Grind the mixture to a coarse powder\n| You may find the mixture starts to clump together after a while - I guess this is because of the [[Oil|oil]] released from the [[Sweet corn|sweet corn]] kernels\n| If this does occur, just add a tablespoons of [[Masa Harina|masa harina]] (or [[Plain flour|plain flour]]) and blitz the mixture for a few seconds to separate the crumbs again\n| Prepare your 'coating station' by beating the [[Eggs|eggs]] and adding to a bowl\n| Pop the [[Flour|flour]] in saucer large enough to accommodate the fillets and finally the [[Ground nut|ground nut]] mixture in another saucer\n| Dredge the [[Fish|fish]] fillets in the [[Flour|flour]], [[Dip|dip]] in the beaten [[Egg|egg]] to coat and then press into the [[Nut|nut]] mixture ensuring the fish is well coated.\n| Carefully arrange the coated [[Fish|fish]] on a [[Grill tray|grill tray]] and [[Bake|bake]] for 15 minutes or until the coating turns golden\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe with [[Chips|chips]], [[Peas|peas]] and [[Garlic mayonnaise|garlic mayonnaise]].\n\nI much prefer proper [[Fish|fish]] shop [[Chips|chips]] to [[Oven|oven]] chips and don't [[Deep fry|deep fry]] at home so I've cheated by using chips bought a few hours earlier that were reheated in another [[Oven tray|oven tray]] while the fish baked.\n===Variations===\nTry this with any type of boneless [[Fish|fish]] fillet, [[Chicken|chicken]] fillets, [[Meat|meat]] steaks and even [[Burgers|burgers]].\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Fish recipes]]\n[[Category:Sea fish recipes]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n[[Category:Favourite recipes]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#fish #sweetcorn #bakedhakewithcrispycashewandsweetcorncoating #cashewnuts #plainflour #roasted #deepfry #masaharina #bake #eggs #chips </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
