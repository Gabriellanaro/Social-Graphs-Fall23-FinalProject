I usually [[Grill|grill]] or [[Barbecue|barbecue]] halloumi but this is another interesting way to cook a much underrated [[Cheese|cheese]].  If you've never used it before, it's great fun.  It squeaks on your teeth when you eat it. It will never melt so you can cook it ways you could never cook normal cheese.  It is available in all supermarkets.\n\nDespite what Hugh says on his recipe page, do not add any [[Salt|salt]] to this recipe or anything that you are serving it with as halloumi is already very salty. This goes very well with a [[Greek salad]].\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 250 g of [[Halloumi cheese|halloumi cheese]], cut into 8 slices\n| 1 heaped tablespoon of [[Plain flour|plain flour]]\n| 1 teaspoon of [[Smoked paprika|smoked paprika]]\n| 1 teaspoon [[Exotic chilli powders|Ancho chilli powder]] or to taste, optional\n| [[Ground black pepper]]\n| 3 tablespoons of [[Olive oil|olive oil]]\n| '''NO [[Salt|salt]]'''!\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Cut the [[Halloumi|halloumi]] into 8 slices\n| Mix the remaining ingredients in a bowl and then tip out onto plate\n| If the halloumi is dry, [[Brush|brush]] or [[Spray|spray]] it with a tiny amount of [[Oil|oil]] so the [[Flour|flour]] binds to it\n| Dredge the slices in the spiced flour and press to coat well. \n| Leave to sit a while if you have time then knock off any excess flour before frying.\n| Heat 3 tablespoons of [[Oil|oil]] in a [[Griddle pan|griddle pan]] or [[Frying pan|frying pan]]\n| [[Fry]] the  [[Cheese|cheese]] slices over a medium heat for about 3 minutes a side or until they take a nice golden colour\n}}\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Halloumi with smoked paprika and chillies.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Leave for a while so the coating sticks\nImage:Fried halloumi with smoked paprika and chillies.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The basic ingredients\n</gallery>\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe hot with a [[Greek salad]]\n===Variations===\nThese could also be brushed wi th oil and [[barbecued]].  The cheese won't melt.\n\nI can't live without chilli, so, 1 teaspoon of [[chilli powder]] in addition to the [[paprika]], lifts this from smoky, to hot and smoky!\n{{SeeAlso-HalloumiRecipes}}\n* http://www.channel4.com/4food/recipes/chefs/hugh-fearnley-whittingstall/fried-halloumi-salad-recipe\n* http://uktv.co.uk/food/recipe/aid/516279\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Greek recipes]]\n[[Category:Snacks and light bites]]\n[[Category:Starters]]\n[[Category:Tapas, mezze and antipasti]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes]]\n[[Category:Cheese recipes]]\n[[Category:Salad recipes]]\n[[Category:Pan fried]]\n[[Category:Grilled, griddled or barbecued]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#hughsfriedhalloumi #cheese #greeksalad #spray #unusualrecipes #groundblackpepper #halloumicheese #flour #griddlepan #brush #chillipowder </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
