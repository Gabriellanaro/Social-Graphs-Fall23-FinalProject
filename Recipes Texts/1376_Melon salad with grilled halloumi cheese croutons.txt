It was an absolute success.  This is a much better way of preparing this recipe.  If you have never used [[halloumi cheese]] before, don't worry, it will not melt.\n\nHalloumi cheese is quite salty so the sweet [[Melon|melon]] balances this perfectly. Do not add any extra salt!\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| [[Olive oil]]\n| 4 [[cloves of garlic]], peeled and crushed.\n| 200g [[Halloumi cheese|halloumi cheese]], cut into into 5mm slices and then cut again to make 5 cm cubes. \n| 800g of honeydew [[Melon|melon]] (about half)\n| A big handful of [[Rocket|rocket]] or similar [[Bitter|bitter]] [[Salad|salad]] leaves.\n| Fresh [[Basil leaves|basil leaves]] or fresh [[Mint leaves|mint leaves]], torn.\n| [[Zest]] and [[Juice|juice]] from an un-waxed [[Lemon|lemon]].\n| A splash of good [[Balsamic vinegar|balsamic vinegar]].\n| [[Freshly ground black pepper]].\n}}\n\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| Cut the [[Melon|melon]] into sliced and slice off the skin\n| Add a good splash of olive oil to a large heavy-based [[Frying pan|frying pan]] and add the cubed [[halloumi]].\n| Fry the cheese cubes for about 5 to 8 minutes over a medium heat until golden brown and crunchy.\n| Add the crushed [[garlic]] for the last few minutes, being careful not to let it burn.\n| Add a [[Pile|pile]] of [[Salad|salad]] leaves, mixed with the [[Mint|mint]] or [[Basil|basil]] onto each plate and layer the [[Melon|melon]] and [[Halloumi|halloumi]] cubes on top.\n| Make a dressing with a splash of [[Olive oil|olive oil]], [[Lemon zest|lemon zest]] and [[Lemon juice|juice]] and the [[Balsamic vinegar|balsamic vinegar]]. 2 to 1 ratio, [[Oil|oil]] to [[Vinegar|vinegar]]/ [[Lemon juice|lemon juice]] and a grind of [[black pepper]].\n| Drizzle this over each plate and serve while the [[Cheese|cheese]] is still warm.\n| Garnish with chopped [[mint]] and [[mint]] leaves.\n}}\n{{SeeAlso-HalloumiRecipes}}\n\n{{Template:Croutons recipes}}\n\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Greek recipes]]\n[[Category:Snacks and light bites]]\n[[Category:Starters]]\n[[Category:Tapas, mezze and antipasti]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes]]\n[[Category:Cheese recipes]]\n[[Category:Fruit recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegetable recipes]]\n[[Category:Pan fried]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#melon #mint #halloumi #garlic #salad #lemonjuice #halloumicheese #balsamicvinegar #oliveoil #basil #clovesofgarlic </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
