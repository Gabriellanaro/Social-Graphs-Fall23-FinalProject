They probably made their own cottage [[Cheese|cheese]], by shaking [[Milk|milk]] and draining the [[Curds|curds]] thoroughly. --[[User:JuliaBalbilla|JuliaBalbilla]] 08:08, 9 January 2009 (UTC)\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes|Csipetke]]\n[[Category:Accompaniments|Csipetke]]\n[[Category:Historic recipes|Csipetke]]\n[[Category:Hungarian recipes|Csipetke]]\n[[Category:Boiled or simmered]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#cottagecheese #curds #sourcream #flour #bacon #fried #boiling #eggs #lard #soups #unusualrecipes </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
