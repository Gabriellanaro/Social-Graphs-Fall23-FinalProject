This is a fabulous meal, for us it had just the right amount of heat and spices.  The [[leeks]] make an interesting change in a curry. \n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 75 g split red [[Lentils|lentils]]\n| 4 tablespoons [[ghee]] or [[Corn|corn]] [[Oil|oil]]\n| 1 heaped  teaspoon black [[Mustard seeds|mustard seeds]]\n| A large pinch of [[freshly ground black pepper]]\n| 2 medium [[Leeks|leeks]], washed and chopped\n| 4 [[Indian green chillies]] or a mix or red and green, split down the middle.  These types of [[chillies]] keep brilliantly in the [[freezer]]. \n| 4 [[Curry leaves|curry leaves]], a few [[bay leaves]] will do as a poor substitute\n| Juice and grated [[lemon zest|zest]] of 1 lemon\n| 2 large [[Tomatoes|tomatoes]], chopped\n| 1 teaspoon of [[curry powder]]\n| 1 teaspoon of [[turmeric]]\n| 2 teaspoons [[Coriander seeds|coriander seeds]], ground\n| 1 teaspoon [[Sea Salt|sea salt]]\n| 450 g whole [[Chicken|chicken]], skinned, boned and cut into cubes\n| Freshly chopped [[Coriander leaves|coriander leaves]] to garnish\n\n}}\n\n===[[Mise en place]]===\nPlace the [[chicken]] pieces, [[lemon juice]] and [[zest]] in a [[Lock & Lock]] box, give then a good shake and leave to [[marinade]] in a cool place fo a few hours or more, if you have the time.  Leave the lemon pieces in while the chicken marinates and discard them before cooking\n\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| ''Wash the lentils carefully and pick over them to remove any stones'', is always advised on [[lentil]] recipes, though I have yet to find any pebbles in my lentils.  I guess food standards have improved since the first [[Indian recipes]] were penned!\n| Place the [[Lentils|lentils]] in a pan with just enough cold water to cover\n| Bring to the [[Boil|boil]], cover and [[Simmer|simmer]] vigorously until soft, about 10 minutes, but it does depend on the type of [[Lentils|lentils]] you are using\n| Most of the water should have been absorbed, keep a few tablespoons of the cooking liquor to loosen the curry a little.  Set the lentils to one side\n| Add the [[ghee]] or [[Oil|oil]] to a [[Wok|wok]] together with the [[black pepper]] and the [[mustard seeds]] and bring it to a medium heat\n| As soon as the [[mustard seeds]] start to pop, quickly add the [[Leeks|leeks]], [[Chillies|chillies]], [[Curry leaves|curry leaves]] and and [[Stir-fry|stir-fry]] gently for 3 to 4 minutes\n| Add the [[chicken]] pieces, together with the [[lemon juice]] and [[stir-fry]] for 7 minutes\n| Tip in the chopped [[tomatoes]], [[curry powder]], ground [[coriander]], [[turmeric]], mix well and cook for a few minutes more\n| Mix in the cooked [[lentils]] with enough of the cooking liquor to loosen the curry\n| Heat and stir until the [[chicken]] is properly cooked, this should probably take another 10 minutes\n}}\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Balti chicken with lentils stir-frying.jpg|Ready to serve\nImage:Balti chicken with lentils ingredients.jpg|The ingredients\n</gallery>\n===Serving suggestions===\nGarnish with [[Coriander leaves|coriander leaves]] and serve hot with [[Parathas|parathas]] or [[naan breads]] and [[cucumber raita]]\n\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes|Chicken]]\n[[Category:Chilli pepper recipes|Chicken]]\n[[Category:Indian recipes|Chicken]]\n[[Category:Main courses|Chicken]]\n[[Category:Poultry recipes|Chicken]]\n[[Category:Spicy recipes|Chicken]]\n[[Category:Stir fried]]\n[[Category:Favourite recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#lentils #chicken #mustardseeds #leeks #chillies #ghee #corianderleaves #cucumberraita #lemonjuice #curryleaves #currypowder </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
