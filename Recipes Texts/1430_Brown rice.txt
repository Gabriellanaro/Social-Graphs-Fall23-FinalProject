It has a nutty, chewy texture.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 75 g [[brown rice]] per person (about &#189; cup per person)\n| Good pinch of [[sea salt]] (optional)\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Rinse in a sieve under cold running water until the water runs clear. (To remove excess starch)\n| &#189; fill a large pan with water and bring to the boil\n| Add the rice, bring back to the boil and boil uncovered for 35-40 minutes. Tasting regularly to check it's to your liking\n| Top up with boiling water if required\n| Remove from heat, strain but don't rinse\n| Add a pinch of salt if liked\n| Serve hot\n}}\n===Variations===\n* Add some chopped [[chives]] for extra colour and flavour.\n* '''White long grain rice'''; decrease cooking time from 35-40 to 12-15 minutes.\n\n===Chef's tip===\n\nRice can be cooked before the meal is due to be served, providing it is properly stored and used the same day.  Allow the [[rice]] to cool and refrigerate until required. Microwave when required, ensuring it is piping hot.  Do not reheat [[rice]] that is more than 1 day old or [[rice]] that may not have been properly stored.\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes|Rice]]\n[[Category:Indian recipes|Rice]]\n[[Category:Rice recipes|Rice]]\n[[Category:Accompaniments|Rice]]\n[[Category:Vegetable recipes|Rice]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes|Rice]]\n[[Category:Vegan recipes]]\n[[Category:Student recipes]]\n[[Category:Boiled or simmered]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#rice #brownrice #plainrice #chives #boiledorsimmered </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
