[[Cayenne pepper]], [[red chili powder]], or other spices give it a red hue. A higher amount of [[turmeric]] produces a yellow-orange colour. In some modern versions, [[Tandoori red food colouring]] is often used. It is traditionally cooked at high temperatures in an earthen oven (tandoor), but can also be prepared on a traditional grill or a very hot oven. This dish is also popular among Hindi, Bengali, and Urdu speaking Indian states like West Bengal & Andra Pradesh. In Pakistan it is eaten with [[naan breads]] and, in Bangladesh, with [[rice]].\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 450 g (1 lb) Skinless [[chicken]] breasts\n| &#189; teaspoon [[sea salt]]\n| &#189; teaspoon [[tandoori colouring]] (optional)\n| 2 cloves [[Garlic|garlic]], peeled and crushed\n| 1 thumb size piece of [[ginger]], peeled and grated finely - use any juice too.\n| &#189; teaspoon [[garam masala]]\n| &#189; teaspoon grated [[nutmeg]]\n| &#189; teaspoon [[chilli powder]]\n| &#189; teaspoon ground [[turmeric]]\n| 150g thick natural [[yogurt]] , about 150 g (5 oz) \n| 3 tablespoons [[vegetable oil]]\n| 4 sprigs [[coriander]]\n| Juice from and zest from a [[lemon]] or [[lime]]\n| Bamboo or wooden [[skewers]]\n}}\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Chicken tikka marinaded in a lock and lock box.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Marinaded chicken pieces, shaken not stirred!\nImage:Chicken tikka ready to marinate.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Chicken pieces ready to marinate, the easy way\n</gallery>\n\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Soak the skewers in cold water\n| Cut the [[chicken]] into 5 cm (2\") cubes\n| Place the cubed chicken in a bowl, add the [[lemon juice]] and the [[salt]] and mix well. This marinade helps to tenderise the [[chicken]]\n| Leave in a [[refrigerator]] for 30 minutes. Leaving it longer won't hurt. \n| Mix the remaining ingredients in a [[food processor]] and blend until smooth\n| Cover the [[chicken]] pieces in the spice mix, cover and marinate for 8 hours or overnight in the refrigerator\n| '''Preheat the [[oven]] to [220\u00b0C (425\u00b0F) Gas 7]'''\n| Place the cubed [[chicken]] on the skewers, leaving a small space between each piece to ensure they cook evenly\n| Cook in the top third of the oven for 10 minutes, then remove and brush with the [[marinade]]. Rotate and return for a further 10 minutes\n| Remove from the oven and rest for 5 minutes before serving\n}}\n===Chef's tip===\nUse a [[Lock and Lock]] style box at the marinading stage to coat the chicken quickly and evenly.  Just add the chicken and the marinade to the [[Lock and Lock box]], close the lid and shake well.  It's then ready to go straight in the [[fridge]] and can be mixed by shaking every now and the.\n\n===Variations===\n\nServe with [[chicken tikka masala]]\n\nCook on a very hot [[barbecue]]\n\nYou can use whole [[chicken]] pieces in this recipe.\n\nCut slits in the [[chicken]] pieces and rub the [[marinade]] well into the chicken.\n\nYou can cook at the top of the oven [220\u00b0C (425\u00b0F) Gas 7] for about 25 minutes in total if using pieces.  Check that they are properly cooked before eating.\n\nTry [[joint your own chicken|jointing your chicken]].\n\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe with rice and a [[naan bread]]\n==See also==\n* [[Chicken tikka (cheat)]]\n* [[Chicken tikka masala]]\n* {{See also - Jointing a chicken}}\n{{Template:PeelingGinger}}\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes|Chicken]]\n[[Category:Barbecue recipes|Chicken]]\n[[Category:Chilli pepper recipes|Chicken]]\n[[Category:Indian recipes|Chicken]]\n[[Category:Main courses|Chicken]]\n[[Category:Marinades dressings and butters|Chicken]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes|Chicken]]\n[[Category:Poultry recipes|Chicken]]\n[[Category:Spicy recipes|Chicken]]\n[[Category:Marinaded]][[Category:Grilled, griddled or barbecued]][[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#chickentikka #chicken #marinade #turmeric #coriander #cayennepepper #chillipowder #lockandlock #lime #lemonjuice #redchilipowder </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
