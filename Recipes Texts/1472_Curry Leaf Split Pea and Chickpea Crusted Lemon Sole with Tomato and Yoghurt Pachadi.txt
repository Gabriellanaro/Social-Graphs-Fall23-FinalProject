Mix together all the [[Marinade|marinade]] ingredients, and rub them all over the fillets. Set aside for 30 minutes \n| Meanwhile, make the [[Pachadi]]. Heat the [[Coconut oil|coconut oil]] in a heavy bottomed saucepan and add the [[Mustard seeds|mustard seeds]]. When they begin to crackle, add the [[Curry leaves|curry leaves]] and [[Onion|onion]], turn the heat down, and saut\u00e9 gently till the [[Onion|onion]] is soft and translucent, but not coloured. Add the [[Turmeric|turmeric]], [[Ginger|ginger]], [[Chillies|chillies]] and [[Tomato|tomato]], and cook till the [[Tomatoes|tomatoes]] are just starting to soften. Leave to cool, then add the [[Coriander leaves|coriander leaves]], [[Yoghurt|yogurt]] and [[Salt|salt]]. Stir, then set aside \n| To make the crust, put the [[Curry leaves|curry leaves]] on a [[Baking tray|baking tray]], and put into a very low [[Oven|oven]] until they go dry and crisp.

Put them into a [[Liquidiser|liquidiser]], and blitz to a quite fine powder. Allow to cool, then add the chopped dry [[Chilli|chilli]] and crushed [[Curry leaves|curry leaves]] \n| Dust the [[Fish|fish]] fillets with the [[Pea|pea]] and [[Curry leaf|curry leaf]] powder to form an even coating. You probably won\u0092t need all of the mixture, it keeps in a jar in a cupboard \n| Heat a tablespoon of [[Coconut oil|coconut oil]] in the [[Frying pan|frying pan]] and add the fillets, [[Frying|frying]] for 1 minute on either side. Place a neat heap of the [[Pachadi]] on each of four plates, carefully place 2 fillets on top of each heap, sprinkle with a little chopped [[Coriander|coriander]] and serve\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe with [[Basmati rice|basmati rice]]\n===Recipe source===\n* https://sites.google.com/site/nikandedwinascookbook/Home/fish/curry-leaf-split-pea-and-chickpea-crusted-lemon-sole-with-tomato-and-yogurt-pachadi\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Indian recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Spicy recipes]]\n[[Category:Fish recipes]]\n[[Category:Sea fish recipes]]\n[[Category:Nik and Edwina's Cookbook recipes]]\n[[Category:Pan fried]]\n[[Category:Recipes from other sites]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#curryleaves #pachadi #coconutoil #onion #fennelseeds #fish #corianderleaves #chickpeas #turmeric #tomato #ginger </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
