We are now converted lovers of [[Basa|basa]] so I thought I would try using that instead.\n\nIf you can get [[Galangal|galangal]], do give it a try, it is one of the oddest [[Spices|spices]] that I've ever tried.  I've not yet decided on its flavour, but the perfume is similar to a very sweet [[Bubble|bubble]]-gum, though its many decades since I've tried [[Bubble|bubble]]-gum!\n\nDo try this, whatever [[Fish|fish]] or [[Spices|spices]] you decide to use!\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| 2 [[Basa fillets|basa fillets]]\n| Pinch of [[Salt|salt]] and [[Freshly ground black pepper|freshly ground black pepper]].\n| [[Zest]] and [[Juice|juice]] of a [[Lime|lime]] or [[Lemon|lemon]]\n| &#189; whole [[coconut]], flesh removed and grated \n| 2 tablespoons [[Vegetable oil|vegetable oil]]\n| 2.5 cm (1 \") fresh [[Galangal|galangal]] root, peeled and thinly sliced\n| 2.5 cm (1\") fresh [[Root ginger|root ginger]], peeled and [[Grated|grated]]\n| 2 [[Red chillies|red chillies]] or small [[Green Indian chillies|green indian chillies]], finely chopped, ''see Chef's notes below''.\n| 3 [[Cloves of Garlic, peeled and crushed|cloves of garlic, peeled and crushed]]\n| 5 cm (2\") [[Lemon grass|lemon grass]] very finely chopped\n| 1 tablespoon [[Nam pla|nam pla]]\n| 200 ml of [[Chicken stock|chicken stock]]\n| 1 400 ml can of [[Coconut milk|coconut milk]]\n| 1 tablespoon [[Jaggery|jaggery]] of [[Brown sugar|brown sugar]]\n| &#189; teaspoon [[Turmeric powder|turmeric powder]]\n| Fresh [[Coriander|coriander]] and chopped red [[Chilies|chilies]] to garnish\n}}\n\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| Chop the [[Fish|fish]] into large bite-sized chunks and if not using [[Basa|basa]], remove any skin and [[bones]].\n| Season the [[Fish|fish]] with a good pinch of [[Salt|salt]] and half of the [[Citrus|citrus]] [[Zest|zest]] and [[Juice|juice]].\n| Using a dry [[Wok|wok]], [[Brown|brown]] the [[Coconut|coconut]] flesh, turning it regularly.\n| Add the [[Vegetable oil|vegetable oil]], [[Ginger|ginger]] and [[Galangal|galangal]], [[Chillies|chillies]], [[Garlic|garlic]], [[Lemon grass|lemon grass]] and [[Fry|fry]] for a few minutes.Add the [[Nam pla|nam pla]] to the tin of [[Coconut milk|coconut milk]] and add the [[Coconut milk|coconut milk]] to the wok by straining through a fine [[Sieve|sieve]]. Reserve the [[Strained|strained]] [[Cream|cream]] to add later.\n| Add the [[Turmeric powder|turmeric powder]] and the [[Chicken stock|chicken stock]] together with the remaining [[Citrus juice|citrus juice]] and [[Zest|zest]].\n| Taste and season with [[Salt|salt]] and [[Black pepper|black pepper]] if needed.\n| Bring to a gentle [[Boil|boil]] and [[Simmer|simmer]] for 10 minutes.\n| Add the [[Fish|fish]] and [[Simmer|simmer]] for another 8 minutes.\n| Remove from the heat and stir in the sieved [[Coconut cream|coconut cream]].\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe with plain [[Basmati rice|basmati rice]] and garnish with freshly chopped [[Coriander|coriander]]\n===Variations===\nUse any firm fleshed [[white fish]] or even [[King prawns|king prawns]].  I think that this recipe would work just as well using [[Chicken|chicken]] instead of [[Fish|fish]].\n\nI will try this with next with [[Chicken thighs|chicken thighs]] and [[Chicken drumsticks|chicken drumsticks]].\n===Chef's notes===\nI used 2 [[Indian green chillies]] and one similarly sized red [[chili]], finely chopped, seeds not removed, and the heat was perfect.\nWe would normally serve this with rice, but we had just been gifted some freshly dug new potatoes which actually went really well with this. Great for soaking up all that lovely gravy!\n{{Template:PeelingGinger}}\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Indian recipes]]\n[[Category:Mauritian recipes]]\n[[Category:Portuguese recipes]]\n[[Category:Vietnamese recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Spicy recipes]]\n[[Category:Chilli pepper recipes]]\n[[Category:Fish recipes]]\n[[Category:Freshwater fish recipes]]\n[[Category:Sea fish recipes]]\n[[Category:Shellfish recipes]]\n[[Category:Dry fried]]\n[[Category:Boiled or simmered]]\n[[Category:Favourite recipes]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#fish #fishcurrywithcoconutandlemongrass #galangal #zest #coconutmilk #lemongrass #basa #vegetableoil #chickenstock #turmericpowder #coconut </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
