You should not have any trouble finding it a Indian or Chinese wholesalers such as [http://www.seewoo.com Seewoo]\n\nDon't be startled by the quantities of garlic, chillies or onions in this dish.  It's not overpowering and a little goes a long long way.  Be bold and try this recipe, it will become a favourite.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 2 large fresh [[red chillies]], deseeded\n| 2 large fresh green [[chillies]], deseeded\n| 2 dried [[chile de Arbole]]\n| 1 whole [[Garlic|garlic]] bulb, smashed and peeled\n| 1 teaspoon [[cumin]] seeds\n| 112 ml (4 fl oz) [[vegetable oil]] - whilst not authentic, I prefer [[olive oil]] for health reasons.\n| 1.3 kg (3 lb) [[onions]], peeled and finely chopped (a job for the [[food processor]]!)\n| 1 teaspoon [[turmeric powder]]\n| 2 teaspoons [[ground coriander]]\n| 1 teaspoon [[cayenne powder]]\n| 1 tablespoon [[jaggery]] or [[sugar]]\n| 1 teaspoon [[sea salt]]\n| 6 tablespoons [[tamarind pulp]]\n| 1.3 kg (3 lb) [[king prawns]], shelled, de-veined and cleaned\n}}\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:King prawn patia at rest.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Resting for 40 minutes\nImage:King prawn patia ingredients.jpg|thumb|300px|right|King prawn patia<br />The ingredients\n</gallery>\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| In a [[food processor]] or [[mortar and pestle]], grind the [[chillies]], [[Garlic|garlic]], [[cumin]] and one of the [[onions]] to a paste, gradually adding half a cup of water. Set to one side.\n| Heat the oil on a large pan and fry the [[onions]] to a golden colour, carefully add the spice paste and fry until it bubbles.  Add the [[turmeric]], [[coriander]] and [[cayenne]] powders and fry for a few more minutes\n| Stir in the [[tamarind pulp]], [[jaggery]] and 4 fl oz of water and cook for a further 10 minutes, stirring now and again until the sauce has thickened\n| Add the [[prawns]] and cook for 2 minutes\n| Remove from the heat and leave standing for 40 minutes so the [[prawns]] absorb the all of the flavours\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\n\nReheat just before serving\n\nServe with plain [[boiled rice]], [[broccoli]] and [[naan breads]]\n===Chef's notes===\n\nI recently made this recipe for 4 (2 now, freeze 2) but still felt that 1.3 kg of [[king prawns]] was a bit excessive!  So I made the recipe using the same amounts as above, but with 400 g of [[king prawns]], 180 g of [[crayfish tails]] and to bulk it out a little, a winter squash, peeled, sliced and boiled until soft, a little less time than for potatoes of the same size.  I then added the squash with the prawns.\n\n'''Tamarind pulp:''' If the [[tamarind pulp]] comes with stones, then soak it in the 4 fl oz of (boiling) water for 15 minutes, stir well and sieve the stones and any skins out and then use the liquid as stock.\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes|Prawn]]\n[[Category:Chilli pepper recipes|Prawn]]\n[[Category:Garlic recipes|Prawn]]\n[[Category:Fish recipes|Prawn]]\n[[Category:Indian recipes|Prawn]]\n[[Category:Shellfish recipes|Prawn]]\n[[Category:Main courses|Prawn]]\n[[Category:Spicy recipes|Prawn]]\n[[Category:Squash recipes]]\n[[Category:Favourite recipes]]\n[[Category:Pan fried]][[Category:Boiled or simmered]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#kingprawnpatia #onions #tamarindpulp #kingprawns #jaggery #naanbreads #garlic #foodprocessor #cumin #chillies #prawns </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
