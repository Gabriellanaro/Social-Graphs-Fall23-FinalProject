Originally it stated 10 g of dried chillies, crushed, in the marinade.   That equates to about 45 birds' eye chillies.  Too hot for me and I also have guests to consider.  For the chilli marinade, I've used 10g (16 x dried [[chili de arbole]], left whole.  I've also used [[Ancho chili powder]], which has a smokey hint.  None of which is the least bit authentic, but should make an interesting curry.\n\nThe resulting curry was reasonably hot, (about Madras strength).  If you want it hotter, I would suggest cutting the dried chillies in half.  That will allow more of the heat and flavour to mingle with the sauce.  If unsure, taste the sauce during cooking and if it starts to get too hot, remove some, or all of the chilles.\n\nAfter the frying stage, I  decided to use the [[slow cooker]] for the remaining cooking. As there was plenty of sauce, 2.5 hours on high made the lamb nice and tender, without overcooking. \n\nIf you want a more substantial sauce, stir in a few tablespoons of [[cornmeal]] 30 minutes before the ned of the cooking time.\n===Recipe source===\n\n* Adapted from 'Gypsy [[Meat|meat]]' (''Maas banjara'') from Mr Pushpash Pent's wonderful \"India\": ISBN 978-0714859026.\n{{Template:PeelingGinger}}\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Indian recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Spicy recipes]]\n[[Category:Lamb recipes]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:Boiled or simmered]]\n[[Category:Chilli pepper recipes]]\n[[Category:Garlic recipes]]\n[[Category:Slow cooker recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#marinade #lamb #lambadilambcurry #ghee #chiledearbole #garlicpaste #onions #ginger #gingerpaste #curry #anchochilipowder </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
