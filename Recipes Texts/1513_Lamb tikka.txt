Check regularly and test to see if they are done to your liking.  Don't be over-worried about the [[marinade]] burning, it gives it great flavour and does not taste the least bit burnt.  Do worry about the lamb drying out, see Chef's Notes.\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe with [[Naan breads|naan breads]], [[Pillau rice|pillau rice]] and a [[Green salad|green salad]].\n\n===Chef's notes===\nIf you don't have [[Black cumin|black cumin]], just use [[White cumin|white cumin]] instead.\n\nAdjust the [[Chili|chili]] levels to suit your tastes, this can be fairly hot with these quantities, depending upon the types of chili you use.\n\nWhen I originally made this dish, I had planned to make [[Balti lamb tikka]], but changed my mind half-way through.  I would not have sliced the lamb so thinly if I had known I was to grill it. Delicious even so!\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Chilli pepper recipes]]\n[[Category:Indian recipes]]\n[[Category:Lamb recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:Spicy recipes]]\n[[Category:Favourite recipes]]\n[[Category:Pan fried]][[Category:Boiled or simmered]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#lambtikka #marinade #lamb #garlicmayonnaise #seeds #chili #mortarandpestle #whitecumin #redchillies #miseenplace #spices </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
