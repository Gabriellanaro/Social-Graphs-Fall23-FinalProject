Then we sat down and ate a lovely lunch of this one, served with [[Chapatis]], [[Pachadi]], [[Pumpkin Curry]] and Potato Thoran. This is delicious, a succulent, flavoursome dish, with a perfect balance between sweet and sour. We've made it with beef too, and it was equally gorgeous.\n\nGenerally Keralans use a much lighter version of the [[Coconut milk|coconut milk]] we buy in tins in the UK. We've found that if you buy the reduced [[Fat|fat]] [[Coconut|coconut]] [[Milk|milk]], open the can without shaking it, pour off the liquid part and use that, it works well. Then you can dilute the remaining thicker half with a little water and [[Freeze|freeze]] it for next time. We've also recently found Maggi powdered coconut to be excellent for making this curry, though the packet instructions are a little heavy handed; we found 35 g of powder to 300 mls of water to be perfect\"''\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 2 teaspoons [[Keralan masala]]\n| &#189; teaspoon [[Turmeric|turmeric]]\n| 1 teaspoon [[Chilli powder|chilli powder]]\n| 4 teaspoon [[Coriander powder|coriander powder]] \n| 1kg [[Chicken|chicken]], skinned and chopped into rough chunks, [[Parson's nose|parson's nose removed]]\n| 2 [[Onions|onions]], peeled and chopped\n| &#189; thumb of [[Fresh ginger|fresh ginger]], chopped\n| 8 to 10 Cloves of [[Garlic|garlic]], chopped\n| 1 to 2 fresh [[Chillies|chillies]], chopped\n| 1 big [[Tomato|tomato]], sliced\n| 1 big [[Potato|potato]], in 5cm [[Dice|dice]] and par boiled for 15 minutes.\n| 200ml [[Coconut milk|coconut milk]] (see above)\n}}\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Keralan Curry covered with water.jpg|Just covered with water\nImage:Keralan Curry recipe.jpg|Spices, [[onions]] & [[Garlic|garlic]]\nImage:Keralan masala recipe.jpg|Kerelan masala\n</gallery>\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| To the 2 teaspoons of [[Keralan masala|keralan masala]], add the [[Turmeric|turmeric]], the [[Chilli powder|chilli powder]] and the [[Coriander powder|coriander powder]].

(The remains of the tin can be frozen for later use).\n\nI found this fairly bland and would definitely add more chillies next time.\n{{Template:PeelingGinger}}\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Indian recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Spicy recipes]]\n[[Category:Garlic recipes]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:Poultry recipes]]\n[[Category:Nik and Edwina's Cookbook recipes]]\n[[Category:Recipes from other sites]]\n[[Category:Pan fried]][[Category:Boiled or simmered]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#coconutmilk #garlic #leeluskeralanchickencurry #chillies #chillipowder #onions #keralanmasala #chapatis #turmeric #corianderpowder #chicken </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
