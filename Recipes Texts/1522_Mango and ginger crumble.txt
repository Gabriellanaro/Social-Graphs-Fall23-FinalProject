This type of crumble does not hold together as well as a flour-type crumble, but it's all crunch and delicious.\n==See also==\n* [[Mango and ginger crumble]]\n* [[Apple crumble recipe]]\n* [[Apple crumble recipe (Mum's)]]\n* [[Traditional crumble topping|traditional crumble topping]]\n{{Template:PeelingGinger}}\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Indian recipes]]\n[[Category:Sweets and desserts]]\n[[Category:Fruit recipes]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#mangoandgingercrumble #cornflakes #butter #brownsugar #breadcrumbs #tangerine #gingerpowder #orange #almonds #porridgeoats #blueberries </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
