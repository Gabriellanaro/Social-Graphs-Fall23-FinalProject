Surely there's not enough moisture in a [[Poppadom|poppadom]] to enable it to puff up?\n\nWell there is and it works perfectly - I think they are much nicer than [[Deep fried|deep fried]] [[Poppadoms|poppadoms]] which always taste greasy and unhealthy.\n\nIf you really must have a '[[Fat|fat]]-kick' with your papadums, then first [[Brush|brush]] them with a tiny amount of [[Butter|butter]] or [[Olive oil|olive oil]].\n\nThey won't puff up if they are lying on top of each other, or if they are flat on the [[microwave]] turntable.\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| 8 [[Poppadoms|poppadoms]]\n| Spray of [[olive oil]] (optional)\n}}\n\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| Arrange 4 [[Poppadoms|poppadoms]] at a time in a plastic bowl so they stand up independently.\n| You can spray with a little [[olive oil]] if wanted.  Not authentic, but healthier and tastier than sunflower oil.\n| [[Microwave]] for 1 to 2 minutes, checking progress as you go.\n| Remove only those that have fully [[Puffed|puffed]] up and continue until all are nice and puffy.\n| Leave to cool for 2 minutes after cooking because they don't become crisp until they have cooled down.\n}}\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Microwaved poppadoms in plastic bowl.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Arrange in a bowl (plastic is best)\nImage:Khanum Poppadoms.jpg|thumb|300px|right|[https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00TZT2EME/ref=ppx_od_dt_b_asin_title_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 Khanum Poppadoms Amazon uk - sometimes out of stock]\n</gallery>\n===Chef's notes===\nYou do not need special 'microwave poppadoms' for this recipe.  This works for any type of poppadom (or ''papadum'', if you so wish!).\n===The best poppadoms?===\nI've tried lots of different makes of poppadom, some good, some awful. One common problem is that they have a [[cabbage]] taste.  The best I've found (in the UK) are Khanum variety from Amazon (Prime).  They appear to go in and out of stock, but are worth hunting down.  My last order was \u00a39.90 for 10 x 220g packs.
