Oh, and its accompaniment - [[nectarines]]. A fantastic meal. \n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 225 g (8 oz) uncooked [[basmati rice]].\n| 200 ml [[coconut milk]]\n| 175 g (6 oz) cooked [[Chicken|chicken]] pieces - remove any [[bones]]\n| 2 tablespoons [[Ghee|ghee]] or vegetable [[Oil|oil]]\n| 5 [[Fat|fat]] [[Garlic cloves, peeled and crushed|garlic cloves, peeled and crushed]]\n| 5 cm (2\") [[Ginger|ginger]], peeled and roughly [[Grated|grated]]\n| 150 g (5 oz) [[Onions|onions]], peeled and finely chopped\n| 1 [[Coconut|coconut]], flesh removed and roughly grated\n|* see [[Preparing a coconut]]\n| 4 hot [[Chilli peppers|chilli peppers]] (red or green), finely chopped - de-seeded if desired\n| 1 tablespoon [[Lime juice|lime juice]]\n}}\n'''spices'''\n''The charm of this dish is the 'bite' of the whole spices, don't be tempted to grind them!''\n* 2 teaspoons whole [[coriander seeds]]\n* 1 teaspoon whole [[cumin seeds]] (white)\n* 1/2 a teaspoon of whole [[fenugreek seeds]]\n* 1 teaspoon [[turmeric powder]]\n\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Quickly wash and drain the [[rice]] but don't rinse it as you normally would, this dish is best with rice of a starchy consistency. \n| Cook in boiling water for 7 to 11 minutes.\n| Rinse the cooked rice in cold water until it is cold.  Drain well.\n| Add the [[Rice|rice]] to a [[Food processor|food processor]] with a metal blade together with 200 ml of [[coconut milk]] and blend to a thick creamy pur\u00e9e.  Remember, the inside is not going to change much whilst being cooked and will remain at roughly the same consistency as it was when first mixed. \n| Heat the [[Ghee|ghee]] in a [[frying pan]] or [[Wok|wok]] and [[Stir-fry|stir-fry]] all of the [[Spices|spices]] for half a minute, then add the [[Ginger|ginger]] and [[Garlic|garlic]] and allow them to cook for a minute or so.\n| Add the [[Onion|onion]] and reduce the heat a little and let them cook until translucent; about 5 minutes.\n| Add the [[Chicken|chicken]], [[Coconut|coconut]] and [[Chilli|chilli]] to the [[Onions|onions]], mix well and remove from the heat.\n| In a large bowl, mix everything together.\n| Lightly [[Oil|oil]] a large non-stick oven proof [[Frying pan|frying pan]] put on a medium heat.\n| Preheat the [[Grill|grill]].\n| Add the mixture from the bowl to the frying pan and pat down so it is flat\n| Ensure the mixture is evenly distributed and cook gently for about 10 minutes or until the [[Rice|rice]] [[Cake|cake]] has properly solidified.\n| If it catches on the bottom of the pan, use a pallet knife to turn areas of the mixture over, the more crunchy bits there are, the nicer it will taste. \n| After 10 minutes or so, finish the rice cake off under a hot grill to it's nicely toasted.\n| Sprinkle with [[Lime juice|lime juice]] and serve immediately.\n}}\n\n[[Image:Action coconut scraper with vacuum suction base.jpg|300px|thumb|right|An easier way to prepare the grated coconut - [http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00B7JDDL6?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o07_s00 Action coconut scraper with vacuum suction base - \u00a38.98 Amazon UK]]]\n\nDoing a 'freezer clean out', we made a marvellous version of this with 1 [[chicken]] breast and a bag of cooked red kidney beans.  The chicken was thinly sliced and saut\u00e9ed with lots of crushed [[garlic]] and the kidney beans fried with the chicken and mashed down a little - rather like [[re-fried beans]].  This was added in place of the normally cooked chicken in this recipe.\n===A better way of cooking this===\nAfter making variants of this for many years, I've discovered the best method of cooking is to spread the ingredients out on a lightly greased [[baking tray]] and bake at 220\u00b0 C (425\u00b0 F - gas 7) for 35 minutes, stirring up the contents every 10 minutes.  It might be an idea with a meat other than crayfish, to add the meat (or prawns) for the last 10 minutes so they don't dry out.\n[[Image:Crayfish & coconut chili, 1.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Baking tray method shown here with [[Crayfish and coconut rice cake with hot chillies]]]]\n\n===Chef's notes===\nSteamed chicken works well in this recipe - Follow the [[Chinese style steamed chicken]] using a quartered onion and a handful of fresh herbs instead of the Chinese ingredients.\n{{Template:SeeAlso Roti}}\n{{Template:PeelingGinger}}\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Indian recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Spicy recipes]]\n[[Category:Chilli pepper recipes]]\n[[Category:Garlic recipes]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:Poultry recipes]]\n[[Category:Rice recipes]]\n[[Category:Favourite recipes]]\n[[Category:Boiled or simmered]][[Category:Pan fried]][[Category:Grilled, griddled or barbecued]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#chicken #rice #limejuice #garlic #nectarines #ghee #murghirotiwithnectarinesandextracoconut #coconut #onions #coconutmilk #spices </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
