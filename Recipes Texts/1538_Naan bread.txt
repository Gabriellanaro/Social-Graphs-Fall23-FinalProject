These are way better than packaged shop bought naan breads.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 1/2 a teaspoon of [[dried yeast]]\n| 250 g (9 oz) strong white flour\n| 1 teaspoon of sugar\n| 1 teaspoon [[baking powder]]*\n| *''(can be omitted, see [[Talk:Naan_bread|discussion page]])''\n| 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil. I prefer to use [[garlic olive oil]].\n| 1/2 a teaspoon of [[salt]]\n| 2 tablespoons of [[natural yogurt]]\n| *''can be replaced with 2 tablespoons of [[milk]], [[cream]] or [[buttermilk]] if [[yoghurt]] is not available''.\n| Add enough water to make a total volume 120 ml water and yogurt in total - or by weight: 120 g water and yogurt\n}}\n\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n\n* Preheat your top grill to its highest temperature\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Bread maker Naan breads.jpg|Roll out to the size of a pitta bread\nImage:Breadmaker Naan breads.jpg||Divided into four\nImage:Seedy breadmaker naan breads.jpg|A seedy alternative\nImage:Rising naan breads.jpg|Leaving them to rise in a warm place for 20 minutes gives them a puffy texture. ''see text''\n</gallery>\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Knead the [[dough]] by combining all the ingredients and sufficient water, this will be roughly &#190; cup.\n| Wrap the [[dough]] in a damp [[muslin]] cloth and leave it to rise for 2-3 hours.\n| Preheat an oven tray under your grill on it's very highest heat\n| Divide the [[dough]] into 4 small balls.\n| With a rolling pin or by slapping and stretching with your hands, roll out the balls so they are about the size of a pitta bread.\n| Unlike some breads, you don't need to let these prove, straight to the oven they go.\n| [[Brush]] a little vegetable oil on to the hot tray, slap the naans on to the tray and grill for about 2 minutes a side, '''watching it like a hawk!'''  The difference between perfect naan breads and a brown biscuit is about 30 seconds.\n| They should have a crunch on the outside and a soft spongy inside.\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\n\nServe hot, brushed with melted [[butter]].\n\n===Using a bread maker===\n\nIf you have a breadmaker, tip all of the ingredients into it, set it on a long (2:20) dough setting and start at step 3 above.  It could not be easier.\n\nFor the [[Breadmaker|Panasonic SD 253 breadmaker]], use basic dough setting.\n\n'''For the [[Panasonic SD-ZB2502 automatic breadmaker]] use menu option 16, basic dough.'''\n\n===Variations===\n\nExperiment with various flours.  The seedy naans shown were made with Allinson ''seed and grain bread flour'' instead of plain flour, and they were wonderful. You could of course, just add a handful of mixed grain (barley flakes, kibbled rye, sunflower seeds, millet and linseed) to normal flour.\n\nWe've found that by leaving them rise a little in a warm place such as on our fire, pictured, makes them puff up more that they do if you bake them immediately. They are even nicer this way and we now use naans as a preference to [[pittas]].   20 minutes is an ideal time for this, if you leave them any longer they achieve a very bready consistency and are not as nice.  Experiment!  \n\n===Chef's tip===\n\nUse a [[pizza stone]] if you have one for even better results.\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Indian recipes]]\n[[Category:Bread and baking]]\n[[Category:Breadmaker recipes]]\n[[Category:Accompaniments]]\n[[Category:Favourite recipes]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#naanbread #dough #butter #naturalyogurt #miseenplace #pizzastone #pittas #muslin #yoghurt #driedyeast #bakingpowder </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
