This method makes use of a deep [[Fat|fat]] fryer.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 225 g ([[Chickpea|chickpea]]) [[Flour|flour]]\n| 2 level teaspoons [[Salt|salt]]\n| 1 teaspoon [[Garam masala|garam masala]]\n| 1 teaspoon [[Coriander leaves|coriander leaves]], finely chopped\n| 2 tablespoons [[Mint sauce|mint sauce]]\n| 130 - 150 ml water\n| 4 medium [[Onions|onions]], finely sliced\n| [[Peanut oil]]\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| [[Sieve]] the dry ingredients and mix in the [[Coriander leaves|coriander leaves]] and [[Mint sauce|mint sauce]].\n| Add the water and mix in to make a stiff paste; err on the dry side if necessary.\n| Stir in the [[Onions|onions]] and allow to rest for an hour or so.\n| Heat the [[Oil|oil]] to 180 C and drop two or three tablespoons of the mixture into the basket.  Make sure that the bhajees are not touching each other.\n| [[Fry]] for two minutes, remove from pan and place on a large plate which has been covered with kitchen roll; they will not be cooked at this stage.\n| Switch off the fryer.\n| Once the mixture has been used and the bhajees have cooled slightly, shape them into balls.\n| Place them on shallow [[baking tray]]s, lined with [[Greaseproof paper|greaseproof paper]] or [[Bake-O-Glide]] and [[Refrigerate|refrigerate]] for 30 minutes or until you are ready to re-[[Fry|fry]] them.\n| Reheat the [[Oil|oil]] and [[Fry|fry]] the bhajees for a further two to three minutes until [[Brown|brown]].\n| Serve immediately.\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe with [[Yoghurt mint sauce]].\n===Variations===\nFor a [[Shallow fried|shallow fried]], spicier version, see [[User:Chef|Chef's]] [[Onion bhajee (alt)|recipe]].\n===Chef's notes===\nThe amount of water needed is a case of trial and error.  If too wet, the mixture will stick to the [[Frying|frying]] basket, which will need to be washed if it does, before frying the next batch.\n\nShould you wish to keep the [[Oil|oil]] for future use, drain into a saucepan or bowl with the aid of a [[Colander|colander]] lined with [[butter muslin]].  Pour into airtight containers (such as [[Lock&Lock boxes|Lock&Lock]] jugs) and keep in the [[Fridge|fridge]].\n==See also==\n* [[Onion bhajee (alt)]]\n* [[Onion bhajis with mango salsa]]\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes|Onion bhajee]]\n[[Category:Accompaniments|Onion bhajee]]\n[[Category:Indian recipes|Onion bhajee]]\n[[Category:Snacks and light bites|Onion bhajee]]\n[[Category:Spicy recipes|Onion bhajee]]\n[[Category:Starters|Onion bhajee]]\n[[Category:Vegetable recipes|Onion bhajee]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes|Onion bhajee]]\n[[Category:Vegan recipes]]\n[[Category:Deep fried]][[Category:Pan fried]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#onionbhajee #fry #mintsauce #corianderleaves #onions #yoghurtmintsauce #bakingtray #sieve #chickpea #fridge #flour </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
