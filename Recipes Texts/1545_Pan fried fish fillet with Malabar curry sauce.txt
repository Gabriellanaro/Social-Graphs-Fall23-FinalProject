This though, is a gorgeous exception, a classy, sophisticated, exciting dish combining the subtle [[Spice|spice]] crusting of the fish with a complex, zesty, slightly fruity [[Sauce|sauce]]; the last [[Ingredient|ingredient]] to go into the [[Sauce|sauce]], the [[Tamarind|tamarind]], binds the flavours together perfectly. It\u2019s not a madly hot sauce, but the flavours are lifted by a medium strength [[Chilli|chilli]] heat. [[Brill]] works very well, it\u2019s quite a fishy fish, but we've tried it with [[Lemon|lemon]] [[Sole|sole]] and [[Monkfish|monkfish]] too, and they worked beautifully. The [[Butter|butter]] [[Basting|basting]] technique of cooking the fish is an interesting one, the fish is actually cooked much more slowly than conventional pan [[Frying|frying]], retaining flavour and texture and juiciness without making it greasy.\"\n\n'''pan fried fish'''\n{{RecipeIngredients\n|4 x 180g [[brill]] fillets, skin on \n|2 tablespoons of [[ghee]] or [[clarified butter]] \n}}\n'''spice rub'''\n{{RecipeIngredientsNB\n|\u00bd teaspoon ground [[turmeric]] \n|1 teaspoon [[salt]] \n}}\n'''spice crust'''\n{{RecipeIngredientsNB\n|1 teaspoon [[allspice berries]] \n|1 dessertspoon ground [[nutmeg]] \n|1 teaspoon [[black peppercorns]] \n|2 [[blades of mace]] \n|5 cm piece of [[cinnamon stick]] \n|6 green [[cardamom pods]], opened, the seeds taken out, and the pods discarded \n|1 dessertspoon [[ground ginger]] \n}}\n'''masala mix for the sauce'''\n{{RecipeIngredientsNB\n|2 tablespoons ground [[coriander]] \n|2 [[green cardamom pods]], opened, the seeds taken out, and the pods discarded \n|2.5 cm piece of [[cinnamon stick]] \n|2 [[cloves]] \n|2 [[bay leaves]], finely chopped \n|2 teaspoons [[fennel seeds]] \n|1 [[star anise]] \n|\u00bc teaspoon [[ground cumin]] \n}}\n'''sauce'''\n{{RecipeIngredientsNB\n|3 tablespoons of [[coconut oil]] or [[vegetable oil]] \n|2 [[onions]], finely chopped \n|1 medium [[tomato]], finely chopped \n|10 [[curry leaves]] \n|5 cm piece of [[cinnamon stick]] \n|4 green [[cardamom pods]], opened, the seeds taken out, and the pods discarded \n|4 [[cloves]] \n|1 [[bay leaf]] \n|1 tbsp of the masala mix (see above) \n|5 cm piece [[fresh ginger]] finely chopped \n|\u00bd teaspoon ground [[turmeric]] or a 2 cm chunk of [[whole turmeric]] \n|\u00bd teaspoon [[black mustard seeds]] \n|\u00bd teaspoon hot [[chilli powder]] \n|150 ml thin [[coconut milk]] \n|2 teaspoons [[tamarind paste]]  \n|1 teaspoon [[salt]] \n}}\n'''to serve'''\n{{RecipeIngredientsNB \n|Fresh [[coriander leaves]]\n|150 ml [[Greek style yogurt]] \n\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| Pat the [[Fish|fish]] dry with kitchen paper, rub with the [[Turmeric|turmeric]] and [[Salt|salt]] and set aside for at least 30 minutes \n| To make the [[Spice|spice]] crust, [[Roast|roast]] all the [[Spice|spice]] crust ingredients except the [[Ginger|ginger]] and [[Nutmeg|nutmeg]] in a dry, heavy bottomed [[Frying pan|frying pan]] for about 4 minutes, until they start to smell lovely. Leave to cool, then grind to a coarse powder in a [[Mortar and pestle|mortar and pestle]]. Add the [[Ginger|ginger]] and [[Nutmeg|nutmeg]] and mix well. Rub the mixture evenly into the flesh side of the four [[Fish|fish]] fillets, sprinkle some on a plate, and leave them skin side up on top. Set aside \n| To make the masala mix for the [[Sauce|sauce]], [[Roast|roast]] the [[Cardamom|cardamom]], [[Cinnamon|cinnamon]], [[Bay leaves|bay leaves]], [[Cloves|cloves]] and [[Star anise|star anise]] in a dry, heavy bottomed [[Frying pan|frying pan]] for about 4 minutes, until they are fragrant. Leave to cool, then grind to a very fine powder in a [[Spice|spice]] grinder or [[Blender|blender]]. Add the powdered [[Coriander|coriander]], [[Fennel seeds|fennel seeds]] and [[Cumin|cumin]], and give a final blitz to mix the [[Spices|spices]]. Set aside. \n| To make the [[Sauce|sauce]], heat the [[Oil|oil]] in a large [[Frying pan|frying pan]] or [[Wok|wok]] and add the [[Onions|onions]] and [[Cinnamon|cinnamon]]. [[Fry]] gently for about 10 mins, or the [[Onion|onion]] is soft and translucent, then add the [[Cardamom|cardamom]], [[Cloves|cloves]], [[Mustard seeds|mustard seeds]] and [[Bay leaf|bay leaf]]. When the [[Mustard|mustard]] [[Seeds|seeds]] begin to crackle, add the [[Curry leaves|curry leaves]], [[Ginger|ginger]], [[Turmeric|turmeric]], [[Chilli powder|chilli powder]] and a tablespoon of the masala mix (the [[Rest|rest]] will keep well in an airtight container in a cupboard). Stir for one minute, then add the [[Tomato|tomato]] and [[Salt|salt]], and cook till soft. Add the [[Coconut milk|coconut milk]] and [[Simmer|simmer]] gently for 20 minutes. Then add the [[Tamarind paste|tamarind paste]], and [[Simmer|simmer]] for 3 minutes. Then [[Sieve|sieve]] into a small saucepan and remove from the heat. Set aside and keep warm \n| [[Steam]] and drain the [[Spinach|spinach]] \n| To cook the [[Fish|fish]], heat the [[Ghee|ghee]] in a heavy bottomed [[Frying pan|frying pan]], add the [[Fish|fish]], skin side down, and cook over a low to medium heat for about 5 minutes, [[Basting|basting]] with melted [[Butter|butter]] as you do. Then turn over, and cook for another 4 minutes, still [[Basting|basting]] \n}}\n===Serving suggestion===\nPut a puddle of the [[Sauce|sauce]] on each of four plates and carefully place a fillet on top, skin side up. Put a spoonful of [[Spinach|spinach]] on one side and a decent sized blob of [[Yoghurt|yogurt]] on the other, scatter a couple of whole [[Coriander leaves|coriander leaves]], and serve.\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Indian recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Spicy recipes]]\n[[Category:Fish recipes]]\n[[Category:Sea fish recipes]]\n[[Category:Nik and Edwina's Cookbook recipes]]\n[[Category:Pan fried]]\n[[Category:Recipes from other sites]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#fish #sauce #spice #turmeric #basting #ginger #nutmeg #cinnamonstick #roast #staranise #fennelseeds </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
