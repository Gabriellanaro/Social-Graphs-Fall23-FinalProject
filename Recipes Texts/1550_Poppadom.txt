In North India, the [[lentil]] variety is more popular and is usually called 'papad'. [[Salt]] and [[peanut oil]] are added to make a [[dough]], which can be flavoured with seasonings such as [[chili]], [[cumin]], [[Garlic|garlic]] or [[black pepper]]. Sometimes [[baking soda]] is also added. The [[dough]] is shaped into a thin, round flat bread and then dried (traditionally in the sun) and can be cooked by [[deep-frying]], [[roasting]] over an open flame, toasting, or microwaving, depending on the desired texture.\n\nPapadums are typically served as an accompaniment to a meal in India. It is also eaten as an [[appetiser]] or a snack and can be eaten with various toppings such as chopped [[onions]], chutney or other [[dips and condiments]]. In certain parts of India, raw papadums (dried but unroasted) are used in curries and vegetable preparations. Papadums are made in different sizes. Smaller ones can be eaten like a snack chip and the larger ones can be used to make wraps.\n\n\n'''Also know as:'''  ''Appadum'', ''Appala'', ''Appoll'', ''Appalum'', ''Papad'', ''Pappad'', ''Pappard'', ''Pappadum'', ''Popadam'', ''Poppadam'', ''Poppadom'', ''Papari''\n===[[Microwave poppadoms|Microwaved poppadoms]], the healthy option!===\nYou do not need to fry poppadoms, it's cleaned, quicker and healthier to [[Microwave poppadoms|cook them in a the microwave - recipe here]].\n{{CategoryLineIngredients}}\n[[Category:Ingredients]]\n[[Category:Store cupboard items]]\n[[Category:Indian recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:12032020'>#poppadom #dough #onions #flour #appetiser #storecupboarditems #indianrecipes #cumin #roasting #dipsandcondiments #riceflour </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
