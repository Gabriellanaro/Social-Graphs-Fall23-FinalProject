This was a delicious dish that, strangely, gave the pork the texture, and to my mind, the flavour of beef. Although not authentic, I added a few chopped tomatoes as they were spare, and a few chillies for good measure too. Well worth making.\n{{Template:ThinkPig}}\n==See also==\n* A selection of [[Vindaloo|vindaloo recipes]]\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Historic recipes]]\n[[Category:Indian recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:Pork recipes]]\n[[Category:Portuguese recipes]]\n[[Category:Spicy recipes]]\n[[Category:Stewed, braised or pot roasted]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#porcocomvinhoealhos #marinade #onions #garlic #bayleaves #pork #ghee #vindaloo #stewedbraisedorpotroasted #sherryvinegar #butter </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
