Although this recipe refers to the [[Shellfish|shellfish]] as [[Prawns|prawns]], they are actually [[Shrimps|shrimps]], much smaller than prawns.\n\nThis version is made using [[Dried shrimps|dried shrimps]], which you can get from any oriental wholesaler.  Although they are [[Dried|dried]], you will find them in the chill cabinet and need to be kept [[Refrigerated|refrigerated]].  They are worth buying as they are a great addition to [[Special fried rice|special fried rice]].\n\nSoak the [[dried shrimp]] for an hour in just-[[Boiled|boiled]] water to rehydrate them. This also helps to wash off any dust and excess salt.\n\nLeave for a few weeks to mature, this [[Pickle|pickle]] is great as a [[Condiment|condiment]] and even makes a great spread for sandwiches if you like it hot!\n\n===Prawn balchao as meal===\nI have had a requests from people for a prawn balchao ''meal'' recipe, rather than one for a pickle.  I'm afraid that I have not been able to find any recipes that refer to prawn balchao as a finished dish.  Even the wonderful \"India\" - Mr Pushpash Pent:  ISBN 978-0714859026 states: \"The dish is know for it's piquant character: It is more like a pickle relish and is consumed in moderation\".\n\nIf anyone has any helpful information that may clear up this confusion, please do drop me a note via the ''Contact the Editor'' link above.--[[User:Chef|Jerry, aka Chef]] 18:14, 10 December 2012 (UTC)\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 100 g [[Dried shrimp|dried shrimp]]\n| 1 large [[Onion|onion]], peeled and chopped\n| 5 cm (2\") piece if [[Ginger|ginger]], peeled and finely chopped\n| 1 whole bulb of [[Garlic]], peeled and crushed\n| 4 tablespoons [[Tomato|tomato]] pur\u00e9e\n| 140 ml [[Vegetable oil|vegetable oil]]\n| 1 teaspoon [[Nigella|nigella]] [[Seeds|seeds]]\n| 1 teaspoon [[Turmeric powder|turmeric powder]]\n| 1 teaspoon to 1 tablespoon [[Freshly ground black pepper|freshly ground black pepper]] - see Chef's notes\n| 1 to 2 tablespoons [[Chilli powder|chilli powder]]\n| 1 to 2 tablespoons [[Cooking salt|cooking salt]]\n| 3 tablespoons [[Jaggery|jaggery]], ([[White sugar|white sugar]] is fine)\n| 300 ml [[Malt vinegar|malt vinegar]]\n| Lime juice to taste\n\n}}\n\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n* Rinse the [[Dried shrimp|dried shrimp]] and leave to rehydrate for a few hours in just-[[Boiled|boiled]] water.

I made this batch with 1 tablespoon of black pepper but next time I would probably only use 1 teaspoon of black pepper.\n\nI no longer keep fresh [[ginger]], instead I buy in bulk from the ethnic supermarket and make my own [[very lazy ginger]] on a huge scale.  As I use it up I am left with pints of [[ginger]] flavoured [[white wine vinegar]] so in this recipe I used that instead of [[malt vinegar]].\n\nI also used Turkish [[chilli flakes]] instead of [[chilli powder]].\n{{Template:PeelingGinger}}\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Indian recipes]]\n[[Category:Accompaniments]]\n[[Category:Dips and sauces]]\n[[Category:Pickles and preserves]]\n[[Category:Spicy recipes]]\n[[Category:Chilli pepper recipes]]\n[[Category:Fish recipes]]\n[[Category:Shellfish recipes]]\n[[Category:Favourite recipes]]\n[[Category:Boiled or simmered]]\n[[Category:Pickled]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#ginger #driedshrimp #chillipowder #garlic #shrimps #prawns #maltvinegar #nigella #seeds #prawnbalchaopickle #pickle </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
