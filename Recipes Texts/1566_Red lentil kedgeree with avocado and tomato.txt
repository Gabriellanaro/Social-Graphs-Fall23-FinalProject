If they are not cooked after 15 minutes, sprinkle a little more water over them if they are drying out and give them another 5 minutes. Some lentils take longer than others.\n| Peel and [[Dice|dice]] the [[Avocado|avocado]] and toss in the [[Lemon juice|lemon juice]], chop the [[Tomatoes|tomatoes]] and [[Coriander|coriander]] and mix in with the [[Avocados|avocados]].\n| Season with [[Salt|salt]] and [[Pepper|pepper]].\n| Serve the [[Rice|rice]] and [[red lentils]], topped with the [[Tomato|tomatoes]], [[avocados]] and [[herbs]].\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe garnished with [[Lime|lime]] slices.\n\nAfter making this a few times we discovered that raw onions with a splash of lemon juice made a contrasting and refreshing garnish.\n===Variations===\nA few [[Nuts|nuts]] or [[Toasted|toasted]] [[Almonds|almonds]] would be nice added at the last minute.\n\nAdd 3 or 4 cloves of peeled and crushed garlic with the onions.\n===Chef's notes===\nThe prepared Indian curry pastes are a [[cheat]], but a great stand-by for recipes like this.  If you have your own fresh [[Spices|spices]] they you will know what to use to make an equivalent fresh [[Spice|spice]] mix.\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes|Kedgeree]]\n[[Category:Indian recipes|Kedgeree]]\n[[Category:Main courses|Kedgeree]]\n[[Category:Rice recipes|Kedgeree]]\n[[Category:Snacks and light bites|Kedgeree]]\n[[Category:Breakfast recipes|Kedgeree]]\n[[Category:Favourite recipes|Kedgeree]]\n[[Category:Boiled or simmered]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#rice #lentils #butter #avocados #onion #redlentilkedgereewithavocadoandtomato #lemonjuice #coriander #avocado #bayleaf #lime </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
