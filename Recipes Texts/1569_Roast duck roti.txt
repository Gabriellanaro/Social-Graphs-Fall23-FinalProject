That's why I keep trying new ways of varying it.  This time I used a large [[Sous vide hoisin duck breasts|Sous vide hoisin duck breast]] as the meat basis for this dish.\n\nBecause the dish is quite hot and spicy, it is very easy to lose the taste and even the texture of the duck if it is cut into small pieces. Thick slices are the way to go with this piquant South Indian style recipe. \n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 225 g (8 oz) uncooked [[basmati rice]].\n| 200 ml [[coconut milk]]\n| 1 x 160 g cooked [[Duck]] breast, sliced thickly - I used a leftover [[Sous vide hoisin duck breasts|Sous vide hoisin duck breast]]\n| 2 tablespoons [[Ghee|ghee]] or vegetable [[Oil|oil]]\n| 5 [[Fat|fat]] [[Garlic cloves, peeled and crushed|garlic cloves, peeled and crushed]]\n| 5 cm (2\") [[Ginger|ginger]], peeled and roughly [[Grated|grated]]\n| 150 g (5 oz) [[Onions|onions]], peeled and finely chopped\n| 1 fresh [[coconut]], flesh removed and grated\n| 3 hot [[Chilli peppers|chilli peppers]] (red or green), finely chopped - de-seeded if desired\n| 1 tablespoon [[Lime juice|lime juice]]\n| 2 [[nectarines]], chopped\n| 1 [[nectarine]], sliced for garnish\n}}\n'''spices'''\n''The charm of this dish is the 'bite' of the whole spices, don't be tempted to grind them!''\n* 2 teaspoons whole [[coriander seeds]]\n* 1 teaspoon whole [[cumin seeds]] (white)\n* 1/2 a teaspoon of whole [[fenugreek seeds]]\n* 1 teaspoon [[turmeric powder]]\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Duck rice cake grilled side.jpg|Spicy duck rice cake after being grilled\nImage:Duck roti fried.jpg|Frying the rice cake - keep turning it so you get lots of crunchy surfaces\nImage:Duck roti rice puree.jpg|The rice cake mixture - it's quite moist\nImage:Sliced Duck roti rice cake.jpg|Next time I would cut the duck into thick slices\n</gallery>\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Quickly wash and drain the [[rice]] but don't rinse it as you normally would, this dish is best with rice of a starchy consistency. \n| Cook in boiling water for 7 to 11 minutes.\n| Rinse the cooked rice in cold water until it is cold.  Drain well.\n| Add the [[Rice|rice]] to a [[Food processor|food processor]] with a metal blade together with 200 ml of [[coconut milk]] and blend to a thick creamy pur\u00e9e.  Remember, the inside is not going to change much whilst being cooked and will remain at roughly the same consistency as it was when first mixed. If it looks too wet, leave it to rest for 30 minutes. A lot of the excess liquid will be absorbed into the rice.\n| Heat the [[Ghee|ghee]] in a [[frying pan]] or [[Wok|wok]] and [[Stir-fry|stir-fry]] all of the [[Spices|spices]] for half a minute, then add the [[Ginger|ginger]] and [[Garlic|garlic]] and allow them to cook for a minute or so.\n| Add the [[Onion|onion]] and reduce the heat a little and let them cook until translucent; about 5 minutes.\n| Slice the duck breast quite thickly and add to the onion mixture together with the 2 chopped [[nectarines]], the [[Coconut|coconut]] and [[Chilli|chilli]]. Mix well and remove from the heat.\n| Lightly [[Oil|oil]] a large [[Frying pan|frying pan]] put on a gentle heat.\n| Mix the [[Rice|rice]] pur\u00e9e and duck together and tip this into the pan.\n| Ensure the mixture is evenly distributed and cook gently for about 10 minutes, stirring every few minutes so the crunchy base gets evenly distributed.\n| Preheat the [[Grill|grill]].\n| Oil a large oven tray and spread the cooked mixture evenly and [[Brown|brown]] under the hot [[Grill|grill]] until it gets a little crunchy.\n| Sprinkle with [[Lime juice|lime juice]] and serve immediately with sliced [[nectarines]].\n}}\n{{Template:SeeAlso Roti}}\n{{Template:PeelingGinger}}\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Indian recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Spicy recipes]]\n[[Category:Chilli pepper recipes]]\n[[Category:Garlic recipes]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:Poultry recipes]]\n[[Category:Rice recipes]]\n[[Category:Favourite recipes]]\n[[Category:Boiled or simmered]][[Category:Pan fried]][[Category:Grilled, griddled or barbecued]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#nectarines #rice #limejuice #ghee #grill #coconutmilk #coconut #roastduckroti #ginger #chillipeppers #onions </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
