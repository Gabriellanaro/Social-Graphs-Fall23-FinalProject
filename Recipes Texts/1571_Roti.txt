It is made most often from [[wheat flour]], cooked on a flat or slightly concave iron griddle called a [[tawa]]. It is similar to a [[tortilla]] in appearance. Like breads around the world, roti is a staple accompaniment to other foods, maybe spread with [[ghee]] (clarified butter) or [[yogurt]].\n\nWhilst kneading [[dough]] can be therapeutic, if time is your enemy, then the [[food processor]] is your friend.\n\nRoti are the perfect accompaniment to most Indian dishes.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 1 cup [[atta flour]] or [[strong white flour]]\n| 2 tablespoons [[vegetable oil]]\n| [[Salt]] and [[freshly ground black pepper]] to taste\n| 2 tablespoons [[yogurt]] (optional)\n| &#189; cup water\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Tip all of the ingredients and half of the water into the [[food processor]] with a plastic blade or dough hook attachment\n| Blitz the mixture whilst adding a more water a little at a time until you have a soft, pliable dough that is not too sticky\n| Remove from the processor, dust with a little [[flour]] and rest for 30 minutes in a bowl, covered with a damp tea-towel\n| Divide into 6 equal parts and roll into balls\n| With a rolling pin on a floured surface, roll each roti out into a 13cm (5\") disc, about the thickness of a small coin (penny, dime, nickel etc)\n| Without using any [[oil]], heat a [[tava]] or [[frying]] pan until very hot\n| Cook each roti for about 2 minutes a side until flecked with brown patches. They should puff up slightly.\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nKeep warm whilst the remaining rotis are are cooked.\n{{Template:SeeAlso Roti}}\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes|Roti]]\n[[Category:Accompaniments|Roti]]\n[[Category:Bread and baking|Roti]]\n[[Category:Indian recipes|Roti]]\n[[Category:Starters|Roti]]\n[[Category:Snacks and light bites|Roti]]\n[[Category:Pan fried]][[Category:Grilled, griddled or barbecued]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#roti #yogurt #foodprocessor #vegetableoil #griddled #grilled #barbecued #strongwhiteflour #wheatflour #ghee #frying </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
