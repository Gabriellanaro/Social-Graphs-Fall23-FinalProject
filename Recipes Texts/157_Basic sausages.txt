It is not necessarily cheaper to make your own, but at least you know what has gone into them!  This recipe is for a British style [[Breakfast sausage|breakfast sausage]], minus the chemicals and with much more [[Meat|meat]].\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 1kg [[Shoulder of pork|shoulder of pork]], [[Minced|minced]]\n| 200g [[Pork fat|pork fat]], [[Minced|minced]]\n| 5g [[Black pepper|black pepper]], [[Ground|ground]]\n| 5g [[Sea Salt|sea salt]], [[Ground|ground]]\n| 1-2 tablespoons [[Dried|dried]] [[Herbs|herbs]]\n| 100g rusk\n| 150ml water\n| 2 metres [[Sheep|sheep]] casings\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Mix the [[Pork|pork]] and [[Fat|fat]] together - if [[Mincing|mincing]] your own, add bits of fat to the pork as you [[Mince|mince]].\n| In a large bowl, mix the [[Pepper|pepper]], [[Salt|salt]], [[Herbs|herbs]], rusk and water.\n| Add the [[Pork|pork]] and [[Fat|fat]] and mix thoroughly using your hands.\n| Stuff into the casings, using a [[Sausage|sausage]] stuffer, linking, if desired, as you go.\n| Keep in a container in the [[Fridge|fridge]] for 24 hours before consumption, or [[Freeze|freeze]] immediately.\n| If you are making a Cumberland style [[Sausage|sausage]], form into a coil as illustrated and [[Bake|bake]] in the [[Oven|oven]] at 180\u00b0 C (350\u00b0 F - gas 4), rather than [[Fry|fry]].\n}}\n===Variations===\nAdd any [[Herbs|herbs]] and/or [[Spices|spices]] to taste.  Try with finely chopped [[Spring onion|spring onion]] or [[Garlic|garlic]].\n===Chef's notes===\nGood hygene is essential!  Sterlise all of your [[Equipment|equipment]] and your work surface.  Plastic equipment can be sterlised in Milton, but metal items should be [[Boiled|boiled]] for at least 20 minutes.  We also wore shower caps on our heads and latex gloves.\n\nYou can link your [[Sausages|sausages]] after you have stuffed the casings, but I would recommend that to start with, you link as you go in case (like us) you overstuff and then cause the casing to burst whilst linking.\n\nFollow the [[RSPCA Think Pig Checklist]] to make sure that your [[Pork|pork]] has come from pigs that have been reared to higher welfare standards.\n* http://bit.ly/rspcathinkpig\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes|Sausages basic]]\n[[Category:British recipes|Sausages basic]]\n[[Category:Breakfast recipes|Sausages basic]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes|Sausages basic]]\n[[Category:Pork recipes|Sausages basic]]\n[[Category:Uncooked]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#herbs #pork #basicsausages #fat #sausages #sausage #ground #garlic #breakfastsausage #dried #bake </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
