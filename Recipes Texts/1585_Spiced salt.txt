You can play around with your own combination of ingredients - just make sure that they are absolutely [[Dried|dried]] out before use, or they could go mouldy.  This can be made in a [[Thermomix]], a good [[Blender|blender]] or a [[Coffee|coffee]]/[[spice]] grinder.\n{{RecipeIngredientsTM\n| 65g [[Dried|dried]] [[Vegetables|vegetables]] and [[Herbs|herbs]] (see [[Chef's notes|chef's notes]] below)\n| 6 large [[Bay leaves|bay leaves]]\n| 50g [[Dried|dried]] [[Bird's Eye chillies|bird's eye chillies]] (or others of your choice)\n| 40g [[Black peppercorns|black peppercorns]]\n| 20g [https://www.amazon.co.uk/Engevita-Savoury-Yeast-Condiment-Pack/dp/B00A4C48LQ/ref=pd_lpo_vtph_543_bs_tr_t_2?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=7T45S5NDXR6ZXEHKTMM6 Engevita Yeast Flakes]\n| 600g [[Salt|salt]] of your choice - I used [[Salt#Himalayan Pink Rock Salt|Pink Himalayan Rock Salt]]\n}}\n\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| If using a [[Thermomix]], place all of the ingredients into the bowl and grind '''30 secs/ Speed 6-8-10'''.\n| If using a normal [[Blender|blender]] or [[Coffee grinder|coffee grinder]], I would suggest [[Grinding|grinding]] it in smaller batches and the mixing together at the end.\n| Whichever method you use, just grind until you are happy with the texture - I like mine to be a little coarse\n| Transfer to clean [[Glass|glass]] jars or [[Lock&Lock boxes]] and if kept dry, it will keep for at least 18 months.\n}}\n===Recipe source===\n\n* Adapted from a recipe in '''Fast and Easy Indian Cooking''' (Thermomix UK)\n===Chef's notes===\nFor the [[Dehydrated|dehydrated]] [[Vegetables|vegetables]], I used the following ingredients:\n\n*750g [[Celery|celery]]\n\n*2 medium [[Red onions|red onions]]\n\n*Several [[Clove|clove]] of [[Garlic|garlic]]\n\n*A few [[Chives|chives]]\n\nand [[Dried|dried]] them in a [[Dehydrator|dehydrator]].\n\nIf you don't have a [[Dehydrator|dehydrator]], you can buy [[Dried|dried]] [[Onions|onions]], [[Garlic granules|garlic granules]] and [[Chives|chives]], but you will need to dry the [[Celery|celery]] in the [[Oven|oven]].  To do this, slice the [[celery]] as thinly as you can and spread out on [[Baking trays|baking trays]] - the [[celery]] pieces can be close, but shouldn't be touching.  Put your [[oven]] on to its lowest setting and place the trays inside. Leave until totally shrivelled and dried.  This could take several hours, so do it on a day when you won't want the oven for anything else.\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes|Salt spiced]]\n[[Category:British recipes|Salt spiced]]\n[[Category:Indian recipes|Salt spiced]]\n[[Category:Spicy recipes|Salt spiced]]\n[[Category:Vegan recipes|Salt spiced]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes|Salt spiced]]\n[[Category:Chilli pepper recipes|Salt spiced]]\n[[Category:Garlic recipes|Salt spiced]]\n[[Category:Vegetable recipes|Salt spiced]]\n[[Category:Thermomix recipes|Salt spiced]]\n[[Category:Dehydrated|Salt spiced]]\n[[Category:Uncooked|Salt spiced]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#dried #celery #spicedsalt #blender #vegetables #thermomix #chives #spice #dehydrator #coffee #grinding </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
