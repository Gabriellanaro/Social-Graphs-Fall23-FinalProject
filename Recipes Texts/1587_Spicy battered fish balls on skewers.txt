It is a good substitute for [[Prawns|prawns]].\n\nWhen I made this with [[masa harina]] it did not stick well to the fish, however it was really tasty so it will be made again, with the proper ingredients next time.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 2 packs [[Basa|basa]] fillets (about 650 g)\n| 4 tablespoons freshly squeezed [[Lemon juice|lemon juice]]\n| 1 tablespoon freshly Crushed [[Garlic|garlic]]\n| 1 tablespoon freshly [[Grated|grated]] [[Root ginger|root ginger]]\n| 2 [[Eggs|eggs]] - beaten\n| 4 tablespoons [[Single cream|single cream]]\n| 2 tablespoons [[Gram flour|gram flour]]\n| 1 teaspoon [[Lovage seeds|lovage seeds]]\n| &#189; teaspoon [[turmeric]]\n| &#189; teaspoon fine [[Sea Salt|sea salt]]\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Cut the [[Basa|basa]] fillets into skewerable chunks - you may need to fold the basa as you skewer it if it's very thin.\n| Add the [[Basa|basa]], [[Garlic|garlic]], [[Ginger|ginger]] and [[Lemon juice|lemon juice]] to a [[Lock and Lock box|lock and lock box]], close, shake well and [[Refrigerate|refrigerate]] for 30 minutes or so to [[Marinade|marinade]].\n| Whisk the egg in another bowl and add the remaining ingredients.  The consistency should be like [[double cream]]. Adjust by adding more flour or cream.\n| Pour the egg mixture into the [[Lock and Lock box]], close and shake like mad.\n| [[Refrigerate]] for a further 15 minutes.\n| Skewer the [[Basa|basa]] and [[Barbecue|barbecue]] for 10 to 15 minutes or alternatively, shallow [[Fry|fry]] in [[Ghee|ghee]] or [[Butter|butter]] and skewer before serving.\n}}\n===Variations===\nTry this with large [[King prawns|king prawns]], [[Scampi|scampi]] or [[Crayfish|crayfish]].\n===Chef's notes===\nWhen I came to make this i discovered that I had run out of [[gram flour]].  I made it with [[masa harina]] and a little [[plain flour]] to get to the consistency of [[double cream]].\n[[Plain flour]] or [[self raising flour]] would be just as good if you did not have [[gram flour]]\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Indian recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Snacks and light bites]]\n[[Category:Spicy recipes]]\n[[Category:Starters]]\n[[Category:Tapas, mezze and antipasti]]\n[[Category:Fish recipes]]\n[[Category:Freshwater fish recipes]]\n[[Category:Garlic recipes]]\n[[Category:Sea fish recipes]]\n[[Category:Shellfish recipes]]\n[[Category:Barbecue recipes]]\n[[Category:Favourite recipes]]\n[[Category:Grilled, griddled or barbecued]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#basa #gramflour #spicybatteredfishballsonskewers #lemonjuice #masaharina #plainflour #doublecream #prawns #refrigerate #garlic #griddled </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
