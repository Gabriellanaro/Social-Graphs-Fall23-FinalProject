It has a sharp lemony flavour, which until now I've only found useful in [[Salads|salads]].  \n[[Image:25 grams of sorrel leaves.jpg|thumb|300px|right|25 grams of sorrel leaves, larger stems trimmed]]\n\nI found this Hyderabadi recipe in Mr Pushpash Pent's wonderful \"[[India]]\":  ISBN 978-0714859026\n\nI've adapted it very slightly to make it easier for me to replicate here in the UK.\n\nThe sorrel in the original recipe is [[gongura (''Hibiscus sabdariffa'')]], which is described as sour, so our [[English sorrel]] will probably be a reasonable substitute. \n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| 2 tablespoons of [[Ghee|ghee]]\n| 2 tablespoons of [[olive oil]] - not authentic, but healthier than using all saturated fat (ghee)\n| 4 medium [[Onions|onions]], peeled and sliced\n| 1 thumb sized piece of [[Ginger|ginger]], peeled and [[Grated|grated]]\n| 4 [[Fat|fat]] [[Cloves of Garlic, peeled and crushed|cloves of garlic, peeled and crushed]]\n| 1 x 750g (1lb 10 oz) whole [[Chicken|chicken]] cut into pieces and skin removed: [[Jointing a chicken|see here]].\n| Pinch of [[Salt|salt]]\n| 25 g [[Sorrel|sorrel]] leaves, chopped\n| 2 [[Green chillies|green chillies]], de-seeded and roughly chopped\n| 2 [[Red chillies|red chillies]], de-seeded and roughly chopped\n| 1 teaspoon [[Garam masala|garam masala]]\n| 1 teaspoon [[Cumin seeds|cumin seeds]], [[Ground|ground]] to powder\n| 1 teaspoon [[Coriander seeds|coriander seeds]], [[Ground|ground]] to powder\n| 1 level teaspoon [[Chipotole chilli powder|chipotole chilli powder]] - ''optional if you want it quite hot''\n| 2 teaspoons [[Poppy seeds|poppy seeds]], [[Dry roasted|dry roasted]] then [[Ground|ground]] to a paste with a little water\n\n}}\n\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| Heat the [[Ghee|ghee]] and oil in a heavy based pan or [[Dutch Oven|dutch oven]] over a medium heat.\n| Gently [[Stir-fry|stir-fry]] the [[Onions|onions]] for 8 minutes but don't let them colour\n| Add the [[Garlic|garlic]] and [[Ginger|ginger]] and [[Stir-fry|stir-fry]] for another few minutes\n| Add the [[Salt|salt]] and the [[Chicken|chicken]] pieces, reduce the heat to low, cover and cook for 40 minutes or until the [[Chicken|chicken]] is properly cooked.  Stir the chicken now and then. Don't worry that it will be too dry, the chicken released quite a lot of liquid so it eventually  stews in it's own juices, so to speak.\n| While the [[Chicken|chicken]] is cooking, bring a small pan of water to the [[Boil|boil]] and add the [[Green chillies|green chillies]] and [[Sorrel|sorrel]] leaves and [[Simmer|simmer]] for 2 minutes.\n| Drain and allow to cool a little before blending to a paste in a feed processor or [[Pestle and mortar|pestle and mortar]] - add a drop or two of the [[Boiled|boiled]] water if the paste is too dry\n| Add the remaining [[Spices|spices]] and [[Poppy seed|poppy seed]] paste to the [[Chicken|chicken]] and cook for 4 minutes\n| Stir in the [[Sorrel|sorrel]] paste and cook for 2 minutes more.\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe with [[Plain rice|plain rice]], plain [[Naan|naan]] and a [[Yogurt|yogurt]] [[Dip|dip]]\n{{Template:PeelingGinger}}\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Indian recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Spicy recipes]]\n[[Category:Garlic recipes]]\n[[Category:Chilli pepper recipes]]\n[[Category:Poultry recipes]]\n[[Category:Stewed, braised or pot roasted]]\n[[Category:Stir fried]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#chicken #sorrel #ground #spicysorrelflavouredchicken #onions #greenchillies #ginger #ghee #jointingachicken #simmer #englishsorrel </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
