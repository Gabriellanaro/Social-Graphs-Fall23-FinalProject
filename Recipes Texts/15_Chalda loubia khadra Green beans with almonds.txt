With some [[Bread|bread]] it would be a very balanced and healthy meal.\n===Variations===\nInstead of normal [[Mayonnaise|mayonnaise]], I like to use [[Not-for-wimps garlic mayonnaise]] for a bit more bite.\n===Chef's notes===\nDo not overcook the [[Beans|beans]] - they are much better if they are '[[Al dente|al dente]]'.\n\nI made this recipe using homegrown baby [[runner beans]].  As there were not that many of them, I made up the difference with frozen peas and served it with [[gravadlax]] and homegrown [[cucumbers]]. --[[User:Chef|Chef]] 09:44, 13 July 2011 (BST)\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes|Chalda loubia khadra (green beans with almonds)]]\n[[Category:Accompaniments|Chalda loubia khadra (green beans with almonds)]]\n[[Category:Algerian recipes|Chalda loubia khadra (green beans with almonds)]]\n[[Category:Egg recipes|Chalda loubia khadra (green beans with almonds)]]\n[[Category:North African recipes|Chalda loubia khadra (green beans with almonds)]]\n[[Category:Snacks and light bites|Chalda loubia khadra (green beans with almonds)]]\n[[Category:Starters|Chalda loubia khadra (green beans with almonds)]]\n[[Category:Vegetable recipes|Chalda loubia khadra (green beans with almonds)]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes|Chalda loubia khadra (green beans with almonds)]]\n[[Category:Boiled or simmered]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#mayonnaise #beans #salad #parsley #gravadlax #almonds #greenbeans #pile #toasted #groundcumin #unusualrecipes </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
