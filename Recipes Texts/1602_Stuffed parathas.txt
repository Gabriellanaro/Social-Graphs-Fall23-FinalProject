This vegetarian dish is made with a potato (Aloo) stuffing.\n\nI made these with [[strong wholemeal flour]] as I had run out of [[Flour#Durum atta or semolina flour|durum atta]].  I think they are nice this way.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 1 portion [[Aloo stuffing (for parathas)|aloo stuffing for parathas]] \n| 1 Cup [http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=Golden+Temple+flour Golden Temple Flour] (duram atta) - [[Strong flour]] can be used as a substitute.\n| 1/3 \u2014 &#189; cup water\n| &#189; teaspoon [[Salt]]\n| 2-3 teaspoons [[ghee]], [[butter]] or [[vegetable oil]]\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Starting with 1/3 cup of water, add all of the ingredients in a bowl (or a [[food processor]])\n| Knead or blitz the mixture into a smooth elastic [[dough]] adding more water if required.  This will take about 5 minutes if hand-kneading\n| Diving in eight equal sized balls\n| Lightly [[oil]] a Tupperware-type container add the balls, cover and leave to rest for at room temperature for at least 30 minutes, ideally a few hours.\n| Roll out the [[dough]] so it's just large enough to cover the potato ball\n| Wrap the potato with the dough\n| Flour the wrapped dough ball and place the ''messy'' side down\n| Roll out to a 6\" circle (I forgot to photo this, I was too busy eating the results!)\n| Don't worry too much if the potato comes through the dough.  It won't puff up all cheffy, but it'll taste just as good.\n| Place the paratha in a very hot [[frying pan]] or [[tava]] \n| Heat for a minute then flip over for another minute.  I then splash a little oil in the pan and cook for another 2 minutes per side.  You can see when they are done. You can oil the paratha rather than the pan.  I just find it easier this way.\n| (I like to use olive oil as I feel it's healthier, even if it's not authentic)\n}}\n\n<gallery widths=270px heights=270px perrow=5>\n\nImage:Paratha dough.jpg|Paratha dough -  rested\n\nImage:Aloo stuffing for parathas.jpg|Aloo stuffing\n\nImage:Aloo filling, partially wrapped.jpg|Aloo filling, partially wrapped\n\nImage:Aloo filling, totally wrapped.jpg|Aloo filling, totally wrapped\n\nImage:Stuffed parathas.jpg|A plate of success (less the 3 that I ate)\n\nImage:Stuffed parathas recipe.jpg|Closer detail\n\n</gallery>\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Accompaniments|Paratha]]\n[[Category:Bread and baking|Paratha]]\n[[Category:Indian recipes|Paratha]]\n[[Category:Spicy recipes|Paratha]]\n[[Category:Starters|Paratha]]\n[[Category:Snacks and light bites|Paratha]]\n[[Category:Vegetable recipes|Paratha]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes|Paratha]]\n[[Category:Pan fried]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#stuffedparathas #dough #foodprocessor #vegetableoil #tava #ghee #strongflour #strongwholemealflour #panfried #butter </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
