This does take quite a while to prepare, but only takes a few minutes of your time over a long period.  If you want to cheat even more, then use a packet of pre cooked tandoori chicken that most supermarkets sell.  Of course if you want to go the whole-hog, you can make everything from scratch with this [[chicken tikka|chicken tikka recipe]].\n\nI would normally skewer and grill the chicken as the pieces are too small to sit over the grid on a grill pan but as the [[skewers]] could not be found at the last minute I pan fried the chicken instead.  Just cook on a high heat until most of the liquid cooks off.\n\n'''for the  tandoori chicken'''\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 1 pack pre cooked tandoori chicken pieces\n}}\n''OR:''\n{{RecipeIngredientsNB\n| 2 [[chicken breasts]]\n| 1 tablespoon [[lemon juice]]\n| 2 teaspoons [[curry paste]] / Patak's Madras paste / Patak's vindaloo paste etc.\n| 1 small pot [[yogurt]]\n}}\n'''for the pizza topping - 2 pizzas'''\n{{RecipeIngredientsNB\n| 2 medium tomatoes\n| Half a small onion, peeled and thinly sliced\n| 1 ball [[mozzarella]] cheese\n| [[Extra virgin olive oil]]\n| [[Sea Salt|Sea salt]]\n| [[Freshly ground black pepper]]\n\n}}\n\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n* Slice the chicken very thinly, add to a bowl with a tablespoon of [[lemon juice]] and a good pinch of salt.

I quite like them cooked immediately they are rolled out for a more crispy finish.\n| Prick the pizza all over with a fork.
