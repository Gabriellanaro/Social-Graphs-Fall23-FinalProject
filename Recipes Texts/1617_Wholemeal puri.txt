It should be a little smaller than a [[roti]] or a [[chapati]], about 13 cm (5\") round.\n\nWhilst kneading [[dough]] can be therapeutic, if time is your enemy, then the [[food processor]] is your friend.\n\nPuris are the perfect accompaniment to most [[Indian dishes]].\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 1 cup [[atta flour]] or [[strong white flour]]\n| 2 tablespoons [[vegetable oil]]\n| [[Salt]] and [[freshly ground black pepper]] to taste\n| 2 tablespoons [[yogurt]] (optional)\n| Vegetable oil for frying\n| &#189; cup water\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Tip all of the ingredients and half of the water into the [[food processor]] with a plastic blade or dough hook attachment\n| Blitz the mixture whilst adding a more water a little at a time until you have a soft, pliable dough that is not too sticky\n| Remove from the processor, dust with a little [[flour]] and rest for 30 minutes in a bowl, covered with a damp tea-towel\n| Divide into 6 equal parts and roll into balls\n| With a rolling pin on a floured surface, roll each roti out into a disc, about 13 cm (5\") round\n| Heat 2.5 cm (1\") oil in a wok or large heavy-based frying pan \n| Deep fry each puri, holding it under the oil with a slotted spoon until it puffs up which should only take a few seconds\n| Drain on kitchen paper\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\n\nServe immediately\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes|Puri]]\n[[Category:Accompaniments|Puri]]\n[[Category:Bread and baking|Puri]]\n[[Category:Indian recipes|Puri]]\n[[Category:Starters|Puri]]\n[[Category:Snacks and light bites|Puri]]\n[[Category:Pan fried]][[Category:Grilled, griddled or barbecued]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#wholemealpuri #foodprocessor #strongwhiteflour #vegetableoil #chapati #indiandishes #barbecued #dough #yogurt #unleavened #flour </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
