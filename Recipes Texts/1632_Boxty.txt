The dish is mostly associated with the north midlands, north Connacht and southern Ulster, in particular the counties of Mayo, Sligo, Donegal (where it is know locally as '''Poundy''' or '''Poundies'''), Fermanagh, Leitrim and Cavan. \n\nThere are many different recipes but all contain finely grated, raw [[potatoes]] and all are served [[fried]]. The most popular version of the dish consists of finely grated, raw [[potato]] and [[mashed potato]] with [[flour]], [[baking soda]], [[buttermilk]] and sometimes [[egg]]. The grated potato may be strained to remove most of the starch and water but this is not necessary. The mixture is fried on a [[griddle pan]] for a few minutes on each side, similar to a normal [[pancake]]. Traditional alternatives include using only raw potatoes, boiling it as a [[dumpling]] or [[baking]] it as a loaf. The most noticeable difference between boxty and other fried potato dishes is its smooth, fine grained consistency.\n====Traditional limmerick:====\n<code>\n\"Boxty on the griddle,\n\nBoxty in the pan,\n\nIf you can't make boxty,\n\nYou'll never get a man.\"\n</code>\n\nServed at [[Tea|tea]]-time, these [[Potato|potato]] cakes can also be [[Fried|fried]] up to accompany [[Bacon|bacon]] and [[Eggs|eggs]] for breakfast\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 115 g [[Plain flour|plain flour]]\n| &frac12; teaspoon [[Baking powder|baking powder]]\n| &frac12; [[Salt|salt]]\n| 50 g [[Butter|butter]]\n| 450 g [[Potatoes|potatoes]], peeled and [[Boiled|boiled]]\n| 30 ml [[Milk|milk]]\n\n}}\n\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n* Preheat [[Oven|oven]] to 220\u00b0 C (425\u00b0 F - gas 7)\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| [[Sieve]] the dry ingredients and rub in the [[Butter|butter]].\n| [[Mash]] the [[Potatoes|potatoes]] with the [[Milk|milk]] and add to the [[Flour|flour]] mixture.\n| Bind the mixture together and divide into several balls.\n| Flatten the balls so that they are only 5 mm thick.\n| [[Bake]] in the [[Oven|oven]] for 20 minutes.\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe hot and spread with [[Butter|butter]].
