I have made successful facsimiles of this dish using [[Prawns|prawns]] and [[Crayfish tails|crayfish tails]].\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| &frac12; teaspoon [[Paprika powder|paprika powder]].\n| &frac12; teaspoon [[Mustard powder|mustard powder]].\n| 3 tablespoons [[Butter|butter]].\n| 6 [[Button mushrooms|button mushrooms]], sliced thinly.\n| 4 [[Spring onions|spring onions]], [[Sliced on the diagonal|sliced on the diagonal]].\n| About 450 g (1 lb) of fresh or cooked [[Lobster|lobster]] cut into chunks.\n| 4 tablespoons Irish whiskey.\n| 150 ml [[Double cream|double cream]].\n| Squeeze of [[Lemon juice|lemon juice]].\n| [[Sea Salt|sea salt]] and [[Freshly ground black pepper|freshly ground black pepper]].\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Mix the [[Butter|butter]], [[Paprika|paprika]] and [[Mustard powder|mustard powder]] together.\n| Heat the [[Butter|butter]] in a large [[Frying pan|frying pan]].\n| Saut\u00e9 the [[Mushrooms|mushrooms]] for a few minutes until they take a little colour.\n| Add the [[Lobster|lobster]] and [[Spring onions|spring onions]] and saut\u00e9 until the lobster is cooked.  This should only take a few minutes.\n| Add the whiskey - if you want to set fire to it, warm it a little first. Cook for a few minutes more.\n| Add the [[Cream|cream]] heat through, season to taste with [[Salt|salt]] and [[Pepper|pepper]].\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe over [[Plain boiled rice|plain boiled rice]], or a mixture of plain [[Boiled rice|boiled rice]] and wild [[Rice|rice]].\n\nServe in the halved lobster shell if you have it.\n==See also==\n{{Template:Lobster recipes}}\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Fish recipes]]\n[[Category:Historic recipes]]\n[[Category:Irish recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Sea fish recipes]]\n[[Category:Shellfish recipes]]\n[[Category:Pan fried]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#dublinlawyer #lobster #butter #mushrooms #cream #springonions #mustardpowder #boiledrice #plainboiledrice #lemonjuice #seafood </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
