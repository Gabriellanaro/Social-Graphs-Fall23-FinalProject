A little of the water used to re hydrate the [[mushrooms]] made good stock too.  Add dried mushrooms with the meat, even if they have been presoaked.\n\nUse a medium onion, peeled and sliced if you don't have baby onions.\n\nOmit the [[mustard]], replace the Guinness with dry cider, the [[beef]] [[stock]] with [[chicken stock]] and make this dish with meaty [[lamb]] chops\n\n===Serving suggestions===\n[[Blanche]] the [[onions]] in [[boiling]] water for 5 minutes to ease the peeling of the white [[onions]]\n==See also==\n* [[Slow roast recipes]]\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Cooking with beer]]\n[[Category:Beef recipes]]\n[[Category:Irish recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:Potato recipes]]\n[[Category:Stews and casseroles]]\n[[Category:Favourite recipes]]\n[[Category:Boiled or simmered]]\n[[Category:Stewed, braised or pot roasted]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#guinnessstew #potatoes #mushrooms #onions #beef #butter #stock #mustardpowder #simmer #bouquetgarni #boiling </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
