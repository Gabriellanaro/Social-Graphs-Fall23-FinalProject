The ingredients of traditional soda bread are [[Flour|flour]], [[Bread soda|bread soda]], [[Salt|salt]], and [[Buttermilk|buttermilk]]. Other ingredients can be added such as [[Raisins|raisins]], [[Egg|egg]] or various forms of [[Nuts|nuts]].\n\nThe [[Buttermilk|buttermilk]] in the [[Dough|dough]] contains [[Lactic acid|lactic acid]], which reacts with the [[Baking soda|baking soda]] to form tiny bubbles of carbon dioxide. Soda [[Bread|bread]] can dry out quickly and is typically good for two to three days; it is best served warm or [[Toasted|toasted]]. In Ireland, typically the [[Flour|flour]] is made from soft [[Wheat|wheat]]; so soda bread is best made with a cake or [[Pastry|pastry]] flour (made from soft wheat), which has lower levels of [[Gluten|gluten]] than a bread flour.\n\nVarious forms of soda [[Bread|bread]] are popular throughout Ireland. Soda [[Breads|breads]] are made using either wholemeal or [[White flour|white flour]], with the former known colloquially as \"[[Brown|brown]] bread\" in the Republic of Ireland. In Northern Ireland the wholemeal variety is known as \"wheaten bread\" and normally sweetened, while the term \"soda bread\" is restricted to the white savoury form normally served [[Fried|fried]]. The two major shapes are the loaf and the \"[[Griddle|griddle]] cake\", or [[Farl|farl]] in Northern Ireland. The loaf form takes a more rounded shape and has a cross cut in the top to allow the bread to expand. The griddle cake or farl, is a more flattened type of bread. It is cooked on a griddle allowing it to take a more flat shape and split into four sections.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| [[Olive oil]] for greasing\n| 250 g (9 oz) [[Plain flour|plain flour]]\n| 1 level teaspoon [[Bicarbonate of soda|bicarbonate of soda]]\n| 1 level teaspoon [[Salt|salt]]\n| 2 teaspoons  [[Brown sugar|brown sugar]]\n| 225 ml (8 fl oz) [[Buttermilk|buttermilk]] or live [[Yoghurt|yogurt]]\n\n}}\n\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n* Preheat the [[Oven|oven]] to 230\u00b0 C (450\u00b0 F - gas 8) and place a [[baking stone]] or [[pizza stone]] towards the top of the oven with enough room for the loaf to rise.\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Soda bread baking stone.jpg|thumb|300px|right|On the [[baking stone]], ready to bake\nImage:Soda bread ingredients.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Soda bread ingredients - [[spelt flour]] version\n</gallery>\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| '''Important''':  Ensure that the oven already at the right temperature before you start.  This loaf needs no [[proving]] as the [[baking powder]] or [[bicarbonate of soda]] aerates the bread in place of the yeast, however, its action begins once it reacts with moisture, you may loose the 'rise' if you have to wait for the over to warm up.\n| Sift the [[Flour|flour]], [[Salt|salt]] and soda in a mixing bowl and add the [[Sugar|sugar]].\n| Stir in the [[Yoghurt|yogurt]] or [[Buttermilk|buttermilk]] with a spoon at first, then once amalgamated, with your hands\n| The consistency should be pliable and firm, not sticky.\n| Knead the [[Dough|dough]] lightly in the bowl for a few minutes  then shape it into a ball.\n| Cut a cross in the top of the loaf to enable the loaf to 'flower' as it bakes.\n| Place it on a [[baking stone]] or a baking tray\n| [[Bake]] for about 12 minutes, then turn the [[Oven|oven]] down to 200\u00b0 C (400\u00b0 F - gas 6) and bake for a further 15-20 minutes, until the base of the [[Bread|bread]] sounds hollow when you tap it.\n| Allow to cool on a raised grid.\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe with [[Butter|butter]] and [[Cheese|cheese]].  It is best eaten on the day of baking as it does not keep as well as [[Yeast|yeast]]-[[Leavened|leavened]] [[Bread|bread]].\n===Variations===\nUse [[spelt flour]] for a wholemeal-type loaf which is also easier to digest than normal wholemeal flour.\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Bread and baking]]\n[[Category:Irish recipes]]\n[[Category:Historic recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes]][[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#sodabread #bread #buttermilk #flour #bakingstone #speltflour #bakingsoda #bicarbonateofsoda #dough #yoghurt #yeast </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
