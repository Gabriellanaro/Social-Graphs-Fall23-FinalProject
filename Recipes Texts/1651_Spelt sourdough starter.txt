This can be made using strong white flour but it is recommended that you use spelt flour as it has better aerating qualities.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 300g [[Spelt|spelt]] [[Flour|flour]]\n| 300ml [[spring water]] or [[mineral water]]\n| 450g [[strong white bread flour]]\n| A further 450ml water\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Mix 50g [[Spelt|spelt]] [[Flour|flour]] and 50ml of bottled water in a [[Kilner jar|kilner jar]] or Lock&Lock jug which has a capacity of at least 2 [[Litres|litres]].\n| Cover, and leave overnight at room temperature.\n| 24 hours later add, mix in a further 50g [[Spelt|spelt]] [[Flour|flour]] and 50ml water.\n| Continue to add the same amount of [[Flour|flour]] and water until a total six batches have been mixed in every 24 hours.\n| It is best to use the [[Starter|starter]] straight away, but it can be stored in the [[Fridge|fridge]] indefinitely, in which case it will need to be refreshed before use.\n| 24-36 hours before you want to make the [[bread]], pour the starter into a bowl and mix in 225g of the strong white [[flour]] and 225ml of the water.\n| Cover tightly with [[cling-film]] and allow to stand at room temperature overnight.\n| Add the remaining [[flour]] and water, mix well, and allow to stand for a further 5-6 hours, by which time it should be light and bubbly.\n| The [[Starter|starter]] [[Dough|dough]] is now ready for use according to your [[Sourdough bread|sourdough bread]] recipe.\n}}\n===Chef's notes===\n'''Do not use tap water as it contains chlorine.'''\nIf the mixture becomes too thick, add a little more water.\n==See also==\n* [[Rye sourdough starter]]\n* [[Spelt sourdough starter]]\n* [[Cheese and olive sourdough]]\n* [https://sites.google.com/site/nikandedwinascookbook/Home/bread/full-sourdough Sourdough recipe] from Nik and Edwina \n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Bread and baking]]\n[[Category:Irish recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegan recipes]]\n\n[[Category:Uncooked]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#flour #speltsourdoughstarter #spelt #starter #sourdoughbread #bread #mineralwater #dough #fridge #kilnerjar #ryesourdoughstarter </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
