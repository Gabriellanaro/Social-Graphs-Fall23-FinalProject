It is usually a savoury loaf, but can be made with [[Raisins|raisins]], [[Nuts|nuts]], [[Eggs|eggs]], etc.  This is the savoury version.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 350g [[Wholemeal flour|wholemeal flour]]\n| 100g [[Strong white flour|strong white flour]]\n| 300ml [[Buttermilk|buttermilk]]\n| 1 heaped teaspoon [[Bicarbonate of soda|bicarbonate of soda]]\n| 1-2 teaspoons [[Salt|salt]] to taste\n| 1-2 teaspoons [[Sugar|sugar]] to taste\n| 50g [[Porridge oats|porridge oats]] (optional)\n\n}}\n\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n* Preheat the [[Oven|oven]] to 220\u00b0 C (425\u00b0 F - gas 7)\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Sift both the [[Flours|flours]], [[Salt|salt]], [[Sugar|sugar]], [[Bicarbonate of soda|bicarbonate of soda]] and [[Oats|oats]] (if using) in a large bowl.\n| Add [[Buttermilk|buttermilk]] and mix to a [[Dough|dough]] with your hands, stopping as soon as it feels pliable. Over-kneading will result in a heavy loaf.\n| Shape into a ball.\n| Place onto a greased [[baking tray]] or use [[Bake-O-Glide]].\n| Cut a deep cross in the top of the loaf so it will create four large crusts as it rises and bakes.\n| [[Bake]] for 30 to 35 minutes.\n| Loosely cover with [[Tin-foil|tin-foil]] if the crust looks too [[Brown|brown]].\n| The [[Bread|bread]] is properly [[Baked|baked]] when it sounds hollow if tapped on the base.\n| Cool on a wire rack for 10-15 minutes.\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe warm with lots of [[Butter|butter]].\n===Chef's notes===\nMake this immediately the dough has been kneaded.  The rising effect of the [[bicarbonate of soda]] only lasts for a short time so if you delay the result will be a heavy dense loaf.\n\nUse [[Bicarbonate of soda|bicarbonate of soda]], not [[Baking powder|baking powder]].\n\nSee here for various ways of making your own [[Buttermilk|buttermilk]].
