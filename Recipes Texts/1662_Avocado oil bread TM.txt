Good with [[Cheese|cheese]] and [[Salad|salad]]\n===Variations===\nYou can add other ingredients to it such as [[Herbs|herbs]], Crushed [[Garlic|garlic]] or [[Dried|dried]] [[Chilli flakes|chilli flakes]]. Also use different [[Oils|oils]] such as [[Olive oil|olive oil]], but make sure they have a fairly high smoke point. \n===Chef's notes===\nThe tin I used to make this bread is made by Falcon, It is an '''[http://www.amazon.co.uk/Falcon-Enamel-24cm-Oblong-Dish/dp/B000TAVXYI/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1310850610&sr=8-3 enamel pie dish]''' measuring 24cm and is just right for this bread. These dishes are easy to clean - if anything sticks, just soak in hot water for a short while. They are also very inexpensive. \n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Italian recipes]]\n[[Category:Accompaniments]]\n[[Category:Bread and baking]]\n[[Category:Vegan recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes]]\n[[Category:Thermomix recipes]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#dough #avocadooil #oliveoil #dried #semolina #rocksalt #oregano #yeast #garlic #oliveoilbread #avocado </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
