It was Winston Churchill's favourite dish (he knew what he liked!)\nUse a good [[Beef|beef]] fillet (preferably Aberdeen Angus), tell your butcher what you are going to use it for and get them to remove the chain muscle and the silverskin sinews and gristle from the outside of the fillet.\n\n'''[[Duxelles]]'''\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 250 g [[Mushrooms|mushrooms]] chopped very finely.\n| 2 [[Shallots|shallots]] peeled and chopped very finely\n| 2 cloves of [[Garlic]], peeled and crushed\n| 3 tablespoons [[Butter|butter]]\n| 50 ml [[Dry white wine|dry white wine]]\n| 1 sprig of [[Thyme|thyme]]\n| [[Sea Salt|sea salt]] and [[Freshly ground black pepper|freshly ground black pepper]]\n}}\n'''[[Beef]] Wellington'''\n{{RecipeIngredientsNB\n| [[Olive oil]] for [[Frying|frying]]\n| 500g trimmed [[Beef|beef]] fillet (cut from the middle of the fillet)\n| 6 slices of [[Parma ham|parma ham]] or [[Prosciutto]]\n| Made-up [[English mustard recipe|English mustard]]\n| 375g packet of pre-rolled [[Puff pastry|puff pastry]] (you won't need it all).\n| 2 [[Egg yolks|egg yolks]]\n\n}}\n\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n* Preheat the [[Oven|oven]] to 220\u00b0 C (425\u00b0 F - gas 7), [fan oven 200\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]\n===Method===\n\n\n'''[[Duxelles]]'''\nDon't rush this, it's quite long-winded and will probably take around 30 minutes cooking.\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Gently saut\u00e9 [[Garlic|garlic]] and [[Shallots|shallots]] in the  the finely chopped [[Mushrooms|mushrooms]] in the [[Butter|butter]] for about 6 minutes until soft.\n| Add the chopped [[Mushrooms|mushrooms]] and the whole sprig of [[Thyme|thyme]] and gently cook for 10 minutes so most of the [[Mushroom|mushroom]] [[Liquor|liquor]] is cooked off.\n| Remove the sprig of [[thyme]]\n| Add the [[Wine|wine]], a splash of [[lemon juice]] and season to taste.\n| Cook gently until all of the liquid has gone.\n| The [[Duxelles|duxelles]] should stick together easily.\n| Remove from the heat and allow to cool.

Overlap the pastry just enough to join, trimming and discarding any excess.\n| Cut long diagonal slashes in the [[Pastry|pastry]] for decoration, being careful not to penetrate the pastry.\n| [[Bake]] for 35 to 40 minutes until the [[Pastry|pastry]] is nice and crispy.\n| Rest for 10 minutes before slicing and serving\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe with [[Potato wedges|potato wedges]] and a [[Green salad|green salad]].\n\nThe second half, on the second day, was reheated for 30 minutes(180\u00b0C - 350\u00b0 F) and served with [[chips]] and [[peas]].\n====[[Duxelles]] and Beef Wellington, step by step photographs====\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Duxelles ingredients.jpg|The basic ingredients for duxelles\nImage:Shallots and garlic suateed in butter.jpg|[[Shallots]] and [[Garlic|garlic]] [[saut\u00e9ed]] in [[butter]]\nImage:Mushrooms chopped.jpg|Mushrooms chopped in the [[food processor]]\nImage:Mushrooms go in dry.jpg|The [[mushrooms]] look very dry when they are first added\nImage:White wine added.jpg|Wet again once the [[white wine]]/[[sherry]] is added\nImage:Duxelles reduced, ready to cool.jpg|Duxelles completed, ready to cool\nImage:Fillet for beef Wellington.jpg|British prime fillet\nImage:Browning the fillet.jpg|Browned all over\nImage:Fillet steak brushed in mustard.jpg|Brushed generously in English mustard\nImage:IParma ham laid on cling film.jpg|[[Parma ham]] laid out on [[cling film]]\nImage:Duxelles.jpg|[[Parma ham]] brushed with [[duxelles]]\nImage:Rolled up in cling-film.jpg|[[Parma ham]], [[duxelles]], [[mustard]] and [[beef]] fillet, wrapped up in [[cling film]]\nImage:Roll the beef in the puff-pastry.jpg|Roll the beef in the puff-pastry\nImage:Trim excess & join the underside with a fork.jpg|Trim excess pastry & join the underside with a fork\nImage:Decorate with a sharp knife.jpg|Egg-wash & decorate with a sharp knife\nImage:Beef Wellington recipe.jpg|Beef Wellington\n</gallery>\n===Chef's notes===\nI never have [[White wine|white wine]] so use a little less [[Dry sherry|dry sherry]], watered down instead - no one has noticed yet!\n\nI've now made quite a few variations of this recipe, using [[bacon]] instead of [[ham]], including [[pat\u00e9]] in the [[duxelles]] and using different cuts of meat.  My conclusions: This doesn't work well you don't use [[fillet of beef]]. It's rich enough without adding [[pat\u00e9]].  If you use [[bacon]], it makes it too heavy and hard-going.\n\nIf you are making this for just 2 people, make the [[duxelles]] for 4, split the fillet in to two halves, wrap and bake one (to server two people), leave the other wrapped in [[clingfilm]] and bake that in a few days time for another lovely rich meal. That way you get two nice fresh crispy wellingtons rather than soggy leftovers.  You could also make a [[chicken wellington]] with the other half of the [[duxelles]].\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Historic recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Beef recipes]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:Favourite recipes]]\n[[Category:Pan fried]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#duxelles #beef #beefwellington #parmaham #mushrooms #pastry #brush #butter #thyme #clingfilm #shallots </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
