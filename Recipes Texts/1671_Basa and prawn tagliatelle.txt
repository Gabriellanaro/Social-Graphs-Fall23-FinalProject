There is enough here for two gluttons though!\n===Variations===\nUse 100g  of [[dried tagliatelle]] instead of fresh pasta\n\nSmoked basa works well with this recipe.\n\n{{Template:YoutubePastaDough}}\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Pasta recipes]]\n[[Category:Freshwater fish recipes]]\n[[Category:Fish recipes]]\n[[Category:Shellfish recipes|Prawn]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Italian recipes]]\n[[Category:Boiled or simmered]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#basaandprawntagliatelle #parsley #basa #garlic #blackpepper #cream #driedtagliatelle #chives #bones #lobsterbisquesoup #peeledprawns </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
