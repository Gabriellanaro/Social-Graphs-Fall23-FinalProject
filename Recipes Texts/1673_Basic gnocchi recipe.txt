It's worth taking care over this you will have lumpy [[gnocchi]]\n| Add the sifted [[flour]] and half of the beaten [[egg]]\n| Knead with your hands to a soft [[dough]], correcting with extra [[egg]] or [[flour]] if too wet or dry\n| Transfer to a [[flour]]ed cutting board, dry and dust your hands with extra [[flour]]\n| Divide into four and roll each piece into a sausage about 1 cm (1/2\") diameter then cut into 2.5 cm (1\") sections\n| Using the times of a fork, press flat into each piece to make the [[sauce]]-holding pattern, the rougher the better, we want rustic!\n| Cover and chill until required\n| ([[Gnocchi]] does not keep well without discolouring so only make what you are going to use on the day)\n| Warm a serving dish in the oven\n| In a large pan, bring 4 [[litres]] (7 [[pints]]) of water to a [[simmer]]\n| Add the [[gnocchi]] and cook for 3 minutes, they will float after 2 but still need another minute\n| Drain, transfer to the warm serving dish\n| Drizzle your chosen sauce over the gnocchi and serve immediately\n}}\n{{Gnocchi-See also}}\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Pasta recipes]]\n[[Category:Italian recipes]]\n[[Category:Egg recipes]]\n[[Category:Starters]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegan recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegetable recipes]]\n[[Category:Boiled or simmered]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#flour #potatoes #gnocchi #egg #boiling #simmer #mash #dough #boiledorsimmered #sauces #litres </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
