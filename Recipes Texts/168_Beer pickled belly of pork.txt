I have use a mix of lager and mild as I have a plentiful supply from my barrels of home-brew!\n\nThe meat should marinate for 1 week before cooking, which could also be suitable for a preservative cure, however, in this recipe it is purely for the purpose of flavouring.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 1.3 kg (3 lb) [[Belly of pork|belly of pork]]\n}}\n'''[[Pickle]]'''\n{{RecipeIngredientsNB\n| 2 [[Pints|pints]] home made [[Beer|beer]] ( I used a mixture of [[Lager|lager]] and [[Mild ale|mild ale]])\n| 2 [[Pints|pints]] water (or enough to completely cover the joint) \n| 1 tablespoon [[Allspice|allspice]]\n| 100g [[Sea Salt|sea salt]]\n| 4 tablespoons [[Black treacle|black treacle]]\n| 6 tablespoons [[Dark soy sauce|dark soy sauce]]\n| 2 tablespoons [[Chilli powder|chilli powder]] / curry powder\n| 2 tablespoons [[Garlic powder|garlic powder]]\n| 4 tablespoons [[Malt vinegar|malt vinegar]]\n}}\n'''[[Roasting]]'''\n{{RecipeIngredientsNB\n| 1 tablespoon of [[olive oil]]\n| Finely ground [[sea salt]]\n\n}}\n\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n* Slash the [[Pork belly|pork belly]] with a knife so there are deep cuts on both sides to ensure the [[Pickle|pickle]] can really flavour the [[Meat|meat]]\n* Mix the [[Pickle|pickle]] mixture together and place the [[Pork|pork]] in a non-metallic container ensuring the pork is totally immersed. [[Refrigerate]] for 1 week.\n* If you are luck enough to have a smoker, after 1 week, pat the joint dry and smoke for an hour or so before roasting.\n* 1 Week later: Preheat the oven to its highest setting - it will be turned down as soon as the meat goes in.\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Lay the joint on a rack, skin-side-up, over a [[roasting tray]] and rub the olive oil into the skin\n| Sprinkle with finely ground sea salt\n| Place into the oven and immediately reduce the heat to 220\u00b0 C (425\u00b0 F - gas 7) and roast for 20 minutes\n| Using a kitchen towel, pat off any excess fat that may be gathering on the top of the crackling\n| Reduce the heat to 165\u00b0 C (325\u00b0 F - gas 3) and roast for 1 hour or a little longer if needed, it does dry out easily so keep an eye on it.\n| Rest for 10 minutes, then cut into bite-sized chunks\n}}\n{{Template:See-also-pulled-pork}}\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Cooking with beer]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:Pickles and preserves]]\n[[Category:Pork recipes]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#beerpickledbellyofpork #pickle #pints #porkbelly #garlicpowder #roasting #pulledpork #allspice #oliveoil #pork #refrigerate </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
