It was fabulous.  You could probably make a neater version by [[Frying|frying]] individual patties.  I was more concerned with getting it to the table and eating it so I cooked the whole thing as you would with [[Bubble and squeak|bubble and squeak]], patting it flat in the [[Frying pan|frying pan]] and constantly turning it over to ensure that it's cooked evenly.  Add a splash of [[Olive oil|olive oil]] to the pan if it appears to be [[Drying|drying]] out.  I wouldn't worry about the toasty burnt bits either as they are delicious in their own right.  A very successful experiment which went very well with [[Purple sprouting broccoli|purple sprouting broccoli]], [[Sauteed|sauteed]] in [[Olive oil|olive oil]] and a few crushed [[Cloves of garlic|cloves of garlic]].\n\nSwap out the [[Pork|pork]] for [[Feta cheese|feta cheese]] or [[Halloumi cheese|halloumi cheese]] and you have a [[Vegetarian|vegetarian]] version.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| 3 cooked [[Beetroots|beetroots]], [[Grated|grated]] and squeezed dry (or spun in a [[Salad spinner|salad spinner]])\n| 1 [[Cooking apple|cooking apple]], peeled, cored and [[Grated|grated]]\n| 200 g cooked [[Gammon|gammon]] or [[Ham|ham]], [[Shredded|shredded]]\n| [[Freshly ground black pepper]] and a pinch of [[Salt|salt]]\n| [[Olive oil]]\n}}\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Beet pork apple almost done.jpg|Mixture well stirred and almost ready to serve\nImage:pork beetroot apple patted flat.jpg|Mixture patted flat in the frying pan\nImage:beets ready to make Rosti.jpg|Beets grated in a [[food processor]], drained in a [[salad spinner]]\n</gallery>\n\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| Mix all of the ingredients together in a bowl\n| Heat a few tablespoons of [[Olive oil|olive oil]] in a heavy based [[Frying pan|frying pan]]\n| Fill the pan with the mixture and pat it flat\n| Cook on a medium heat for about 5 minutes\n| After 5 minutes, stir the mixture up with a [[Fish|fish]] slice and turn portions of the hash over to ensure its [[Toasted|toasted]] all over\n| Repeat for 10 minutes so the [[Apple|apple]], [[Beets|beets]] and [[Ham|ham]] are [[Caramelised|caramelised]]\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe with [[Purple sprouting broccoli|purple sprouting broccoli]] [[Sauteed|sauteed]] in [[Crushed garlic|crushed garlic]] and [[Olive oil|olive oil]] and [[New Potatoes|new potatoes]]\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:Pork recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegetable recipes]]\n[[Category:Pan fried]]\n[[Category:Favourite recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#oliveoil #beetrootporkandapplehash #ham #grated #purplesproutingbroccoli #saladspinner #sauteed #shredded #beetrootrosti #cookingapple #caramelised </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
