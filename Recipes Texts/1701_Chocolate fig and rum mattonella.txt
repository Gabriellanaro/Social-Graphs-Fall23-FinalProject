It is quite rich and it is often 'set' in a loaf tin to give it a brick shape.  This version with [[Figs|figs]], is particularly suitable at Christmas time.\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| 100g [[Dried|dried]] [[Figs|figs]], stalks removed\n| 100ml [[Dark rum]] (or enough to cover the [[figs]])\n| 250g [[Dark chocolate|dark chocolate]], broken into small squares\n| 125g dark [[Sugar|sugar]]\n| 50g of [[Butter|butter]]\n| 100ml [[Whipping cream|whipping cream]]\n| 125g plain or spiced biscuits, coarsely chopped\n}}\n====To finish====\n{{RecipeIngredientsNB\n| 250ml [[Whipping cream|whipping cream]]\n| 2 tablespoons [[Icing Sugar|icing sugar]]\n| [[Ground cinnamon]] or [[Cocoa|cocoa]]\n}}\n\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| Place the [[Figs|figs]] in a bowl and add enough [[Rum|rum]] to cover (see '''Variations''' below)\n| Leave for at least 30 minutes to [[Marinate|marinate]].\n| Drain thoroughly, chop into small pieces and reserve.\n| In a fresh bowl, over a [[Saucepan|saucepan]] of water, melt the [[Chocolate|chocolate]] with the [[Sugar|sugar]] and [[Butter|butter]].\n| Remove from the heat, add the [[Cream|cream]], [[Figs|figs]] and biscuits.\n| Pour the mixture into a loaf tin which had been lined with [[Foil|foil]] or [[Bake-O-Glide]].\n| Smooth it out and [[Refrigerate|refrigerate]] for several hours.\n| Just before serving, cut the Mattonella into slices and put 2 slices on each plate.\n| Whip the [[Cream|cream]] with the [[Icing Sugar|icing sugar]] and pipe some shapes onto the plates.\n| Sprinkle the [[Cream|cream]] with a little [[Ground cinnamon|ground cinnamon]] or [[Cocoa powder|cocoa powder]].\n}}\n\n===Chef's notes===\nI used a 500g loaf tin with a volume of about 800ml.  This tin could have taken half the mixture quantity again.  A 250g tin was too small.\n===Recipe source===\n* Translated and lightly adapted from a recipe at [http://blog.giallozafferano.it/uovazuccheroefarina/mattonella-di-biscotti-e-cioccolato-con-fichi-e-rum-scuro/ Uova Zucchero e Farina]\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Italian recipes]]\n[[Category:Sweets and desserts]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes]]\n[[Category:Fruit recipes]]\n[[Category:Cooking with wine]]\n[[Category:Uncooked]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#figs #cream #groundcinnamon #whippingcream #chocolatefigandrummattonella #butter #icingsugar #darkchocolate #dessert #foil #rum </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
