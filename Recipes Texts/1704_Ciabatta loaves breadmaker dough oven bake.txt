The mixing and first rising are done in a Panasonic [[Breadmaker|breadmaker]].  The second rising and [[Baking|baking]] are not.  Start the day before you want to eat the bread.\n\nThis recipe is basically the same recipe as [[parmesan ciabatta]], but without the cheese! \n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n}}\n====1st [[Dough|dough]]====\n{{RecipeIngredientsNB\n| 1/8 teaspoon easy-[[Bake|bake]] [[Dried yeast|dried yeast]] [0.5 g]\n| 125g strong white [[Bread|bread]] [[Flour|flour]]\n| 105ml water [105g]\n}}\n====2nd [[Dough|dough]]====\n{{RecipeIngredientsNB\n| 1/2 a teaspoon of easy-[[Bake|bake]] [[Dried yeast|dried yeast]] [2 g]\n| 125g strong white [[Bread|bread]] [[Flour|flour]]\n| 115g [[Plain flour|plain flour]]\n| 1/2 a teaspoon  of [[Salt|salt]] \n| 1 tablespoon [[Olive oil|olive oil]]\n| 30ml [[Milk|milk]] [30g]\n| 150ml water [150g]\n}}\n\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n\nAn hour before you are ready to bake the loaves, preheat your oven to 220\u00b0 C (425\u00b0 F - gas 7), [fan oven 200\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour] and leave it at this temperature fr an hour before baking.\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n}}\n====Starter dough====\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Add the ingredients for the first [[Dough|dough]] to the [[Breadmaker|breadmaker]] pan in the order in which they are given.\n| For Panasonic SD253 and most breadmakers, set to 'Basic [[Dough]]'. \n| For the [[Panasonic SD-ZB2502 automatic breadmaker]] set to menu option 16, basic dough.\n| When when the cycle has finished, switch off the machine and leave to rest at room temperature for about 18 hours.\n| ''I make this recipe alot and sometimes the breadmaker does not mix the starter dough properly.  This is because of the small amount of dough in the starter. If this happens I just use a spoon to stir in any unmixed flour and re-run the dough procedure a second time.  I've always had perfect results doing this.'' \n}}\n====Main dough (second rise)====\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Add the ingredients for the second [[Dough|dough]] to first dough in the [[Breadmaker|breadmaker]] pan in the order in which they are given.\n| Set to 'French Dough' [[Panasonic SD-ZB2502 automatic breadmaker|Panasonic SD-ZB2502]]: option 21 - 3 hours 35 mins.\n| The [[dough]] should be quite sticky when finished.\n| Turn out onto a lightly floured [[Pastry mat|pastry mat]] or board and cut the [[Dough|dough]] into two.\n| Shape each piece into oblongs of about 25cm each on [[baking tray]]s or stones, which have been dusted with [[Flour|flour]] or [[Semolina|semolina]].\n| Cover with a damp [[Tea-towel|tea-towel]] and leave to rise in a [[warm place]] until the [[Dough|dough]] has doubled in size. ''My loaves puffed up to about twice the volume but the footprint stayed roughly the same size.'' \n}}\n====Baking====\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Preheat the [[Oven|oven]] to 220\u00b0 C (425\u00b0 F - gas 7) and keep it hot for one hour before [[Baking|baking]].\n| Shake the risen loaves onto a pre-heated [[oven tray]] or [[pizza stone]] and[[Bake]] the [[Bread|bread]] for about 20 minutes until golden brown.\n}}\n\n{{Template:Ciabatta bread recipes}}\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes|Parmesan ciabatta]]\n[[Category:Bread and baking|Parmesan ciabatta]]\n[[Category:Breadmaker recipes|Parmesan ciabatta]]\n[[Category:Cheese recipes|Parmesan ciabatta]]\n[[Category:Italian recipes|Parmesan ciabatta]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes|Parmesan ciabatta]][[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#dough #bread #flour #breadmaker #bake #baking #driedyeast #warmplace #bakingtray #plainflour #oliveoil </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
