If you have a [[Thermometer|thermometer]] it needs to reach 190C, but you can test that it\u0092s ready by dropping some [[Bread|bread]] into the oil and it should [[Brown|brown]] in 20 seconds.\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Mix the [[ricotta cheese]], [[lime]] juice and zest in a bowl and season with [[salt]] and [[black pepper]]\n| Spoon enough filling into each flower, leaving enough room to close the flowers.  A wooden [[cocktail stick]] is helpful to hold the flowers closed while frying. \n| Set the flowers aside and prepare the batter\n| Ensure the water is ice cold.\n| Sift the [[flour]], [[cornflour]] and [[salt]] together into a bowl. \n| Make a well in the centre of the flour and pour your chosen liquid together with the previously beaten egg into it.\n| Using a [[balloon whisk]], very gently combine ingredients into a rough batter.\n| It is very important that it is not overmixed at this stage as that will make the batter stodgy.\n| Once your batter is 'runny' enough to coat your chosen filling, stop mixing, even if this leaves the odd lump in the batter.\n| When you are ready to cook, dredge each flower in plain flour, dip into the batter and deep fry for 3.5 minutes\n| Leave on [[kitchen paper]] to drain excess oil \n| Cooked tempura can be kept warm in an oven at 150\u00b0 C (300\u00b0 F), with the door left ajar to keep it crispy.\n}}\n===Chef's notes===\nLumpy batter is good,  It ensures that you do not overwork the batter and turn it into stodge.\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Italian recipes]]\n[[Category:Accompaniments]]\n[[Category:Snacks and light bites]]\n[[Category:Starters]]\n[[Category:Tapas, mezze and antipasti]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes]]\n[[Category:Egg recipes]]\n[[Category:Squash recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegetable recipes]]\n[[Category:Deep fried]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#plainflour #cornflour #blackpepper #deepfried #batter #lime #courgette #tempura #ricottacheese #lager #beer </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
