This one uses a spicy pizza topping with home smoked bacon, topped with an egg.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 1 portion [[spicy tomato pizza topping]] (use a jar of shop-bought pizza sauce if you're stuck for time)\n| 1 portion [[pizza dough]] - makes 2 pizzas\n| 200 g (7 oz) [[mozzarella cheese]] (drained)\n| 100 g good quality sliced [[meat]] (eg: [[prosciutto]], [[salami]], [[speck]]). I used 50g (2 oz) thinly sliced [[Home smoked bacon]] \n| 2 tablespoons [[grated]] [[Parmesan cheese]]\n| 2 fresh [[free range eggs]]\n| 1 tablespoon [[capers]]\n| [[Fine yellow cornmeal]] for dusting\n\n}}\n\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n* Preheat the oven to 220\u00b0 c (425\u00b0 F - Gas 7)\n\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Make 1 pizza per person\n| Dust the work surface with [[Fine yellow cornmeal]]\n| Roll or stretch the pizza bases out. I'm not good at getting them into neat circles, as long as there is enough room for the topping, I'm happy. \n| Prick the pizza all over with a fork. This prevents it puffing up too much and burning while it is cooking.\n| Make the pizza up on a lightly greased, or lightly floured baking tray. It's very hard to transfer once made up, without a [[pizza peel]].\n| Divide the ingredients in two:\n| Spread the [[tomato sauce]] over one the pizza\n| Break the [[mozzarella]] into chunks and sprinkle over the [[sauce]], followed by the [[capers]], the sliced meat and half of the [[Parmesan cheese]]\n| Break the egg in the centre of the pizza\n| Sprinkle with the remaining [[Parmesan cheese]]\n| [[Bake]] for 15 to 20 minutes - keeping your eye on it!\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\n\nServe hot or cold\n\nGreat with [[creamy coleslaw]]\n===Chef's tip===\n\nFor an even better, more authentic pizza, use a [[pizza stone]].\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes|Pizza]]\n[[Category:Pizza recipes|Pizza]]\n[[Category:Cheese recipes|Pizza]]\n[[Category:Egg recipes|Pizza]]\n[[Category:Main courses|Pizza]]\n[[Category:Spicy recipes|Pizza]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n[[Category:Italian recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#eggandbaconpizza #parmesancheese #fineyellowcornmeal #capers #pizzas #pizzapeel #bake #mozzarella #freerangeeggs #salami #grated </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
