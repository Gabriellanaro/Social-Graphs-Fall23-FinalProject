It makes a thick, rich [[Sauce|sauce]] perfect with [[Pasta|pasta]]. The recipe freezes well so the ingredients can be increased for later use or to increase [[Servings|servings]].\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 1 tablespoon [[Oil|oil]]\n| 1 small [[Red onion|red onion]]\n| &#189; [[Leek|leek]]\n| 1 [[Garlic|garlic]] clove\n| &#188; [[Red pepper|red pepper]]\n| 1 [[Carrot|carrot]]\n| 1 small [[Courgette|courgette]]\n| 1 tin chopped [[Tomatoes|tomatoes]]\n| 150ml [[Vegetable Stock|vegetable stock]]\n| 1 tablespoon [[Tomato puree]]\n| &#189; tablespoon [[Sun dried tomato]] [[Puree|puree]] (optional)\n| &#189; teaspoon [[Sugar|sugar]]\n| [[Basil]]\n}}\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Five Vegetable Pasta Sauce cooking.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Cooking the veg.\nImage:Five Vegetable Pasta Sauce ingredients.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Five Vegetable Pasta Sauce, the ingredients\n</gallery>\n\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Chop all of the [[Vegetables|vegetables]] fairly small, &#189; inch cubes or smaller.  It will save effort with the [[Hand|hand]] [[Blender|blender]] later and they will cook down quicker.\n| Heat the [[Oil|oil]] in a large pan\n| [[Fry]] the [[Carrot|carrot]] first as ths will take longest\n| Add the remaining veg, [[Onion|onion]], [[Leek|leek]], [[Garlic|garlic]], [[Red pepper|red pepper]] and [[Courgette|courgette]] and cook until soft.  about 10 minutes.\n| Add the tin [[Tomatoes|tomatoes]], [[Sugar|sugar]], [[Stock|stock]] and purees and give another few minutes to bring back up to heat.\n| [[Dried]] or fresh [[Basil|basil]] can be used, add at the last minute before blending.  No need to chop first if using fresh.\n| Using a [[Hand|hand]] [[Blender|blender]] straight in the pot is easiest although you can do this gradually in a worktop blender, blend until you reach a consistency you prefer.\n| Freezes well and can be gradually [[defrosted]] from [[Frozen|frozen]] on a low heat on the [[Hob|hob]] or in the [[Microwave|microwave]].\n}}\n===Chef's notse===\nThank you [[User:Kitchenminion|Kitchenminion]], for a wonderful recipe idea.  With the addition of a cheese topping, the ingredients shown served 2 people, for 2 days.  The only changes I made were to microwave the carrots first and add a pinch of [[ancho chile]] powder.\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Italian recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes]]\n[[Category:Pasta recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegetable recipes]]\n[[Category:Favourite recipes]]\n[[Category:Stir fried]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#fivevegetablepastasauce #leek #vegetables #redpepper #carrot #blender #garlic #basil #courgette #tomatoes #hand </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
