Leave in a [[warm place]] for 5 minutes to dissolve.\n| In a large mixing bowl, add the sifted [[Flour|flour]] and [[Salt|salt]]. Make a well in the centre and pour in the yeasted liquid.\n| Mix with your hands, adding as much of the remaining warm water as needed to make a sort pliable [[Dough|dough]].\n| Tip the [[Dough|dough]] out onto a floured worktop and [[Kneading bread|knead]] with your hands for 10 minutes so it becomes silky and elastic.\n| Clean the large bowl,  lightly [[Oil|oil]] it (an oil [[Spray|spray]] is good for this), add the [[Dough|dough]], cover with a damp cloth and leave to rise in a [[warm place]] for 2 hours.\n| [[Knock down]] and leave to rest for 10 minutes.\n| Shape the [[Dough|dough]] into a rectangle (35 cm x 20 cm (14\" x 8\")\n| Cover with a cloth and leave to rest for a further 15 minutes.\n| Sprinkle the [[Cheese|cheese]], [[Basil|basil]], [[Garlic|garlic]] and a little of the [[rosemary]] over the [[Dough|dough]] then, starting from one of the shorter side, roll up like a [[Swiss]] roll.\n| Place on an oiled [[Baking|baking]] sheet and [[Punch|punch]] holes in the surface.  This is where the [[Mozzarella cheese|mozzarella cheese]] will erupt from while it bakes.\n| Drizzle with half of the [[Olive oil|olive oil]] the sprinkle with chopped [[Rosemary leaves|rosemary leaves]], [[Salt|salt]] and [[Pepper|pepper]].\n| [[Bake]] for 1 hour.\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nDrizzle with the remaining [[Olive oil|olive oil]] and serve warm.\n===Chef's note===\nIf using a [[pizza stone]] follow the preheating directions and allow to heat in the [[oven]] and slide the [[focaccia]] onto the stone from a [[cornmeal]]-dusted [[pizza peel]] or similar.\n==See also==\n* [[Stromboli]]\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Italian recipes]]\n[[Category:Bread and baking]]\n[[Category:Snacks and light bites]]\n[[Category:Starters]]\n[[Category:Tapas, mezze and antipasti]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes]]\n[[Category:Cheese recipes]]\n[[Category:Breadmaker recipes]][[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#dough #focacciastromboli #oliveoil #focaccia #breadmaker #mozzarellacheese #pizzastone #focacciabread #garlic #warmplace #rosemary </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
