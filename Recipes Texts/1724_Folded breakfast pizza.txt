I don't think I could eat this for [[Breakfast|breakfast]] though, but it makes a wonderful evening meal!\n\nIt's worth draining the excess sauce from the [[Beans|baked beans]] and removing the extra water from the [[Mozzarella|mozzarella]] or your [[Pizza|pizza]] might be a bit soggy.\n\nYou can make your own [[Pizza dough|pizza dough]] or buy ready made [[Pizza|pizza]] [[Dough|dough]], the rest is easy.
