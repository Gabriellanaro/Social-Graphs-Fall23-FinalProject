We have our own hens so that's a help!\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 1 portion of [[Pizza dough|pizza dough]] - Makes 2 pizzas\n| 5 or 6 spears of giant [[Asparagus|asparagus]]\n| 1 [[Green bell pepper|green bell pepper]], [[Roasted sweet peppers|roasted]] de-seeded and roughly chopped\n| 220 g of [[Goat|goat]]'s [[Cheese|cheese]]\n| 4 tablespoons of [[Tomato sauce|tomato sauce]] - see Chef's notes below\n| 2 [[Hard boiled eggs|hard boiled eggs]], peeled but left whole\n| A handful of [[Fresh herbs|fresh herbs]], chopped\n| [[Extra virgin olive oil]]\n| [[Sea Salt|sea salt]] and [[Freshly ground black pepper|freshly ground black pepper]]\n\n}}\n\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n* Chop the [[Asparagus|asparagus]] diagonally in 2cm slices, discarding the woodier parts from lower down.\n** Normal [[Asparagus|asparagus]] can be left whole and [[Blanched|blanched]] for about 3 to 4 minutes.\n* [[Boil]] the [[Asparagus|asparagus]] for 10 to 12 minutes\n* [[Roast]] the [[Sweet Pepper|pepper]] - [[Roasted sweet peppers|see here]]\n* Make the [[Pizza dough|pizza dough]]\n* Preheat the [[Oven|oven]] to 220\u00b0 C (425\u00b0 F - gas 7), [fan oven 200\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Make 1 pizza per person\n| Roll the [[Dough|dough]] out into two circles\n| Divide the fillings into two portions, one for each pizza\n| Spread the [[Tomato sauce|tomato sauce]] on to one half of the circle, leaving the edge free from [[Sauce|sauce]]\n| [[Crumble]] the [[Cheese|cheese]] over the [[Sauce|sauce]]\n| Sprinkle the chopped [[Herbs|herbs]], [[Asparagus|asparagus]] and [[Green peppers|green peppers]] over the [[Sauce|sauce]]\n| Pop the [[Egg|egg]] in the middle, season with [[Salt|salt]] and [[Pepper|pepper]] and give a final drizzle of [[Olive oil|olive oil]]\n| [[Brush]] the clean edge with water or [[Milk|milk]] so it helps to make a good seal\n| Fold the [[Pizza|pizza]] [[Calzone folding]]\n| [[Bake]] for about 20 minutes\n}}\n===Variations===\n* These pizzas are so versatile that you can put almost anything in them. They will get hot enough to melt the cheese but anything that might need pre-cooking needs to be done outside of the pizza.  They get ''just'' hot enough to cook a raw egg if that's any help.\n===Chef's notes===\nAs we make [[Pizzas|pizzas]] so often, I divide up homemade [[Tomato sauce|tomato sauce]] into single-[[Pizza|pizza]]-portions and [[Freeze|freeze]] them in small bags.  If I've no homemade [[Sauce|sauce]], I [[Cheat|cheat]] and use a few tablespoons from a bottle of ready made [[Pasta sauce|pasta sauce]]  and freeze the remainder as above.\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Italian recipes]]\n[[Category:Bread and baking]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes]]\n[[Category:Cheese recipes]]\n[[Category:Egg recipes]]\n[[Category:Pizza recipes]][[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#asparagus #sauce #tomatosauce #goatscheeseandasparaguscalzonepizza #cheese #pizzadough #pizza #roastedsweetpeppers #egg #sweetpepper #blanched </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
