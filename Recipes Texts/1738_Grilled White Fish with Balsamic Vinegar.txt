Leave for 10 minutes. \n| Meanwhile, rinse the [[Rice|rice]] and place in a pan with 450ml cold water. Bring to the [[Boil|boil]], then immediately reduce the heat to very low and cover the pan. Cook for 10 minutes. Turn off the heat and leave, covered, for 10 minutes.\n| [[Boil]] the kettle. Preheat the [[Grill|grill]] to its highest setting. Rinse the [[Fish|fish]] and pat dry with kitchen paper.\n| Smear the [[Fish|fish]] fillets with [[Olive oil|olive oil]], place on 15cm [[Foil|foil]] squares and fold up the edges to make little boat.\n| Splash each fillets with 1 tablespoon [[Balsamic|balsamic]]. Place on the [[Grill pan|grill pan]] and cook, placed about 6cm from the heat, for 5-8 minutes, depending on the thickness of the fillet, until just cooked through. If more convenient, cook the [[Fish|fish]] in hot [[Oven|oven]] (400F/200C/gas mark 6).\n| Cook the [[Spinach|spinach]] for 1 minute in [[Boiling|boiling]] [[Salted|salted]] water. Drain in a [[Colander|colander]], pressing out excess water.\n}}\n\n(''Lindsey Bareham in The Times'')\n\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Grilled White Fish with Balsamic Vinegar grilling.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Grilling\nImage:Grilled White Fish with Balsamic Vinegar marinading.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Marinading\n</gallery>\n\n===Serving suggestions===\nSlip [[Fish|fish]] and juices on to a plate and serve with the [[Rice|rice]] and [[Spinach|spinach]].\n===Variations===\nInstead of grilling in tin-foil 'boats', I just marinaded the fish for 2 hours in [[balsamic vinegar]] and [[olive oil]] and then grilled for about 4 minutes a side, turning once - lightly oil the grill tray first to prevent sticking.\n\nThis was very nice served with [[new potatoes]] ([[Potatoes#Pictures of varieties of potatoes|Pink Fir Apple]]) and a small salad.\n\n{{Template:Belazu attribution}}\n===Belazu products used in this recipe===\n* [http://www.mybelazu.com/details/balsamic-vinegar.html Belazu Balsamic Vinegar]\n* [http://www.mybelazu.com/details/early-harvest.html Belazu Early Harvest Extra Virgin Olive Oil Unfiltered]\n* [http://www.mybelazu.com/products/extra virgin-olive-oils.html Belazu Extra virgin olive oil]\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Belazu recipes]]\n[[Category:Recipes from other sites]]\n[[Category:Fish recipes]]\n[[Category:Italian recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Sea fish recipes]]\n[[Category:Grilled, griddled or barbecued]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#fish #grilledwhitefishwithbalsamicvinegar #spinach #oliveoil #boil #rice #balsamicvinegar #belazu #grill #basa #balsamic </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
