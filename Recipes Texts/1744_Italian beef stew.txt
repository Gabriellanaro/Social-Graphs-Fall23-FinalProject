I don't think [[kidney beans]] are authentic for an Italian dish, but they help to pad out the protein and make the meal stretch to four servings.  They're tasty too as they soak up the flavours in the gravy.\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| 530 g [[Beef stewing steak|beef stewing steak]]\n| 1 tablespoon [[Taste Sensation Italian seasoning]]\n| 1 small [[Red onion|red onion]], peeled and finely chopped\n| 1 [[Yellow pepper|yellow pepper]], deseeded and chopped into small pieces\n| 2 fresh [[Tomatoes|tomatoes]], finely sliced and chopped\n| 250 ml [[Red wine|red wine]]\n| 1 tin [[Plum tomatoes]]\n| 1 tin [[Red kidney beans|red kidney beans]], well rinsed and drained\n}}\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Italian beef stew ready to cook.jpg|Ready to cook\nImage:Italian beef stew ingredients.jpg|The basic ingredients\nImage:Italian dumplings cooked.jpg|Cooked to perfection\nImage:Italian dumplings ready to cook.jpg|Dumplings, coated with gravy and ready to cook.\n</gallery>\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| Add all of the ingredients to your [[Slow Cooker|slow cooker]], stir well and slow cook on low heat for eight hours or so.\n| Check now and then to ensure it does not dry out and add a little extra liquid if needed.\n}}\n===Variations===\nA recipe like this is ideally suited to using up leftover vegetables.  If you are using softer vegetables that are likely to turn to mush after prolonged cooking, add them during the last few hours of cooking.\n\nProbably not authentically Italian, but I used the remaining meat, padded out by the kidney beans, to make two 'pies' with [[dumpling crusts]] - very good they were too. [75g suet, 150g self-raising flour - 200\u00b0C for 40 minutes].\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Italian recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Beef recipes]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:Cooking with wine]]\n[[Category:Slow cooked]]\n[[Category:Recipes from other sites]]\n[[Category:Taste Sensation recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#italianbeefstew #slowcooker #redonion #yellowpepper #dumplingcrusts #beefstewingsteak #redkidneybeans #tomatoes #vegetables #kidneybeans #plumtomatoes </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
