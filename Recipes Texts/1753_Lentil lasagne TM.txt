[[Puy lentils]] are cooked in 20-25 minutes if [[Boiled|boiled]], so try not to overcook them, especially as they have had a short soaking beforehand.  Just don't let the mixture get too dry and bear in mind that the liquid will continue to evaporate whilst making the [[Basic white sauce|b\u00e9chamel sauce]].\n{{LasagneRecipes}}\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Italian recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes]]\n[[Category:Cheese recipes]]\n[[Category:Grain and bean recipes]]\n[[Category:Pasta recipes]]\n[[Category:Boiled or simmered]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#butter #cheese #lentils #lasagne #puylentils #nutmeg #onion #sauce #garlic #vegetablestock #groundcoriander </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
