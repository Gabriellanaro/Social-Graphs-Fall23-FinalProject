You can omit that step if you wish, other than imparting more [[Garlic|garlic]] flavour, it probably doesn't make too much difference.\n[[Image:Liver coated, ready to fry.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Breadcrumbed liver, ready to fry]]\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| 3 tablespoons [[Butter|butter]]\n| Pinch of [[Freshly ground black pepper|freshly ground black pepper]]\n| 6 [[Cloves of Garlic, peeled and crushed|cloves of garlic, peeled and crushed]]\n| 200 ml [[Milk|milk]]\n| 200g [[Lambs|lambs]] [[Liver|liver]], deveined and thinly sliced\n| 1 tablespoon picked [[Thyme leaves|thyme leaves]]\n| 2 [[Eggs|eggs]], beaten\n| 2 tablespoons of [[Plain flour|plain flour]]\n| 25g [[Breadcrumbs|breadcrumbs]]\n}}\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n\n* Add the [[Milk|milk]], half of the [[Crushed garlic|crushed garlic]] and the sliced [[Liver|liver]] to a [[Lock and Lock box]], cover, shake well and leave for an hour or two, shaking now and then.\n\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| Drain the [[Milk|milk]] from the [[Liver|liver]] using a [[Sieve|sieve]] so you retain the [[Garlic|garlic]]!\n| Beat the [[Thyme leaves|thyme leaves]] into the [[Egg|egg]]\n| Arrange the [[Flour|flour]], [[Breadcrumbs|breadcrumbs]], [[Egg wash|egg wash]] on plates, and a spare plate for the coated [[Liver|liver]]\n| Coat the [[Liver|liver]] in [[Flour|flour]], [[Dip|dip]] in the [[Egg wash|egg wash]] and roll in the [[Breadcrumbs|breadcrumbs]]\n| Heat the [[Butter|butter]] in a [[Frying pan|frying pan]] and add the [[Black pepper|black pepper]]\n| Add the remaining [[Garlic|garlic]] to the pan and [[Fry|fry]] for one minutes\n| Add all of the [[Liver|liver]] to the pan and cook for 5 minutes, turning once\n| Remove from the pan and [[Rest for|rest for]] 5 minutes\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe with a light [[Salad|salad]] and [[Tomatoes|tomatoes]].  We had some leftover roasties too.  Yum!\n===Variations===\nWe make [[Breadcrumbs|breadcrumbs]] from the [[Bread|bread]] we [[Bake|bake]] everyday which makes this look rather 'gnarly'.  Normal breadcrumbs are fine.\n===Chef's notes===\nAdd the [[Flour|flour]] to a [[Lock and Lock box]] with the drained [[Liver|liver]], cover and shake well.  This is quick, easy and the best way to evenly flour the liver.\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Italian recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Garlic recipes]]\n[[Category:Lamb recipes]]\n[[Category:Salad recipes]]\n[[Category:Pan fried]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#liver #breadcrumbs #garlic #flour #butter #thymeleaves #eggwash #liveringarlicbutter #sieve #panfried #salad </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
