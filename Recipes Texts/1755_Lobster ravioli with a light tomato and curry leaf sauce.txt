It takes about 5 minutes. Turn the dough out onto a [[Semolina|semolina]] dusted work surface and let stand for 5 minutes. Then [[Knead|knead]] for 5 minutes until the dough is very smooth, and similar in texture to plasticene. Cover the ball of dough with [[Cling Film|cling film]] and allow to [[Rest for|rest for]] a least 2 hours in the [[Fridge|fridge]] \n| To make the [[Sauce|sauce]], put a tablespoon of [[Groundnut oil|groundnut oil]] into a large [[Saucepan|saucepan]]. Gently [[Fry|fry]] the [[Onions|onions]] for a minute or so then add the [[Curry leaves|curry leaves]] and [[Tomatoes|tomatoes]]. Cook until tomatoes have softened, then add the water, [[Coriander|coriander]] [[Roots|roots]] and [[Fish stock|fish stock]]. [[Simmer]] for 20 minutes, then strain and check seasoning and set aside \n| To make the [[Ravioli|ravioli]] filling, [[Steam|steam]] the [[Lobster|lobster]] for four minutes. Remove from heat, and allow to cool a little, then chop finely. Place two thirds of the lobster in a [[Food processor|food processor]] along with the [[Chilli|chilli]], [[Spring onions|spring onions]], [[Milk|milk]], [[Cream cheese|cream cheese]] and [[Parsley|parsley]], and whizz until very smooth. Then stir the remaining lobster into the mix, and set aside \n| To make the [[Ravioli|ravioli]], roll the [[Pasta|pasta]] out thinly and pass through a [[Pasta machine|pasta machine]] until almost translucent. Place on a floured surface and cut out 12 x 8cm circles. Put a heaped teaspoon of the [[Lobster|lobster]] mixture in the centre of 6 of the circles, then smear a little water around the edge. Pop another disc of pasta on top, smoothing the edges together ensuring that there aren't any air bubbles inside, and seal the edges well. Place on a plate sprinkled with fine [[Semolina|semolina]], to stop the ravioli sticking together. Repeat with the other half of the pasta to create a total of 6 pieces. This can be done 3-4 hours in advance, if needs be \n| Finally get a large pan of [[Boiling|boiling]] [[Salted|salted]] water going. Once at a rolling [[Boil|boil]], gently add the [[Pasta|pasta]] and cook for 4-5 minutes. Meanwhile reheat the [[Sauce|sauce]] and divide between two [[Soup|soup]] plates. Add three [[Ravioli|ravioli]] each, garnish with some [[Salad|salad]] leaves and serve\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe with your favourite [[Salad|salad]] leaves\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Italian recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Fish recipes]]\n[[Category:Pasta recipes]]\n[[Category:Sea fish recipes]]\n[[Category:Shellfish recipes]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n[[Category:Nik and Edwina's Cookbook recipes]]\n[[Category:Boiled or simmered]]\n[[Category:Recipes from other sites]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#pasta #lobster #semolina #sauce #ravioli #groundnutoil #salad #coriander #springonions #creamcheese #parsley </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
