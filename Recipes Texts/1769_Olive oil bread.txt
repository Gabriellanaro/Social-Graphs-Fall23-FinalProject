I have started by making an overnight sponge, to encourage [[Yeast|yeast]] acitivity, but you can omit that stage if you like amd mix in all the ingredients at the same time.\n\nSee 'Variations' below for instructions on partially or fully making this [[Bread|bread]] in a [[Breadmaker|breadmaker]].\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 15g fresh [[Yeast|yeast]] or 1x7g sachet of fast-action [[Dried yeast|dried yeast]]\n| 320g [[Sparkling mineral water|sparkling mineral water]]\n| 500g [[Strong white bread flour|strong white bread flour]]\n| 20g [[Semolina|semolina]]\n| 10g [[Salt|salt]]\n| 50g [[Olive oil|olive oil]] + 4 tbsps, plus a little extra for [[Brushing|brushing]]\n| Coarse [[Rock|rock]] or [[Sea Salt|sea salt]]\n| [[Dried]] or fresh [[oregano]], to taste\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Make an overnight sponge by dissolving the [[Yeast|yeast]] in the water and mixing into half the [[Flour|flour]] and all the [[Semolina|semolina]] - if using [[Dried yeast|dried yeast]], just stir it in with the [[Flour|flour]] before adding the water.\n| The following morning, mix in the remaining [[Flour|flour]], [[Salt|salt]] and 50g [[Olive oil|olive oil]] to form a sticky [[Dough|dough]], adding more water if necessary.\n| [[Knead]], using your chosen method.\n| Shape into a ball and leave to rest in a lightly oiled bowl, until almost double its size.\n| Lightly [[Flour|flour]] the worksurface and empty the [[Dough|dough]] onto it.\n| Gently deflate the [[Dough|dough]] and [[knead]] briefly.\n| Repeat steps 4-6, omitting the kneading.\n| Lightly [[Oil|oil]] a pie dish (see Chef's notes below) and place the [[Dough|dough]] in the pie dish.\n| Drizzle the 4 tablespoons [[Oil|oil]] over the top and push the [[Dough|dough]] gently towards the sides of the dish.\n| Cover with [[Clingfilm|clingfilm]] and leave to prove for 45 minutes.\n| Dimple the [[Dough|dough]] sporadically and prove for a further 30 minutes.\n| Meanwhile, preheat the [[Oven|oven]] to 220\u00b0 C (425\u00b0 F - gas 7), [fan oven 200\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour].\n| Sprinkle the [[Dough|dough]] with the [[Oregano|oregano]] and coarse sea or [[Rock salt|rock salt]].\n| [[Bake]] in the [[Oven|oven]] for 25-30 minutes.\n| Slide onto a wire rack and [[Brush|brush]] with a little more [[Olive oil|olive oil]] whilst still hot.\n| Allow to cool before cutting or tearing.\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nThis is delicious on its own, no [[Butter|butter]] needed so very healthy!  Good with [[Cheese|cheese]] and [[Salad|salad]].\n===Variations===\nYou can add other ingredients to it such as [[Herbs|herbs]], Crushed [[Garlic|garlic]] or [[Dried|dried]] [[Chilli flakes|chilli flakes]].  Also experiment with different [[Oils|oils]] such as [[Avocado oil|avocado oil]], but make sure they have a fairly high smoke point.\n\nYou can make the whole thing in a [[Breadmaker|breadmaker]], but you will have a brick shaped loaf.  However, you can use it to do the hard work for stages 2-7.  In either case, select the Italian setting or the setting for which you have a [[Focaccia|focaccia]] recipe in the manufacturer's recipe booklet.  For the [[Panasonic SD-ZB2502 automatic breadmaker]], use menu option 21, French dough rise.\n===Chef's notes===\nThe tin I used to make this bread is made by Falcon,  It is an '''[http://www.amazon.co.uk/Falcon-Enamel-24cm-Oblong-Dish/dp/B000TAVXYI/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1310850610&sr=8-3 enamel pie dish]''' measuring 24cm and is just right for this bread.  \n\nThese dishes are easy to clean - if anything sticks, just soak in hot water for a short while.  They are also very inexpensive.\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Italian recipes]]\n[[Category:Bread and baking]]\n[[Category:Vegan recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes]]\n[[Category:Breadmaker recipes]]\n[[Category:Favourite recipes]][[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#dough #flour #yeast #oliveoil #oliveoilbread #dried #breadmaker #knead #semolina #oregano #driedyeast </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
