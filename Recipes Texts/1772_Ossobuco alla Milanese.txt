Slowly braised, this relatively tough, yet flavourful cut of meat becomes meltingly tender, and the connective tissues and [[Marrowbone|marrow]] dissolve into the sauce, making it rich and creamy.\n[[Image:Ossobuco ready to cook.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Ready to go]]\n\nThe shank is a relatively cheap cut of [[veal]] which is readily available in most good supermarkets and butcher shops. Look for meaty hind-shanks cut from the top of the thigh with a high proportion of meat-to-bone; each piece should be about 5\" across and 1\" to 1&frac12;\" thick.\n\nTraditionally, '''ossobuco''' is made without [[tomatoes]] (these being unknown in Milan until the late 19th century). However, the traditional version, prepared with [[cinnamon]], [[allspice]], [[bay leaf]] and [[gremolata]] called in bianco, has by and large been replaced with the newer version which includes [[tomatoes]] and the 'holy trinity' of Italian cooking: [[carrot]], [[celery]] and [[onion]], flavoured with a [[bouquet garni]] and without [[gremolata]] (although 'hybrid' versions exist which include both [[tomato]] and [[gremolata]]). It should be noted that while the traditional combination with [[risotto alla milanese]] is perfect for the former version (for which is was intended), the modern-day version with [[tomato]], which is both moister and bolder in flavour and does not combine well with [[saffron]], is better served with [[polenta]]. The following recipe is for a 'modern' version.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 4 slices [[veal hind shank]], about 1\" to 1&frac12;\" (2.5cm to 4cm) thick\n| 1 medium [[onion]], chopped finely\n| 3 ribs [[celery]] with leaves, chopped finely\n| 1 medium [[carrot]], chopped finely\n| 2 [[cloves garlic, crushed]]\n| 3 tablespoons [[butter]]\n| 4 tablespoons [[olive oil]]\n| 1 cup (240ml) dry white [[wine]] or white [[vermouth]]\n| 2 cups (about 480ml) [[beef stock]]\n| 3 tablespoons [[tomato puree]]\n| 6 [[anchovy]] fillets, mashed\n| &frac12; teaspoon dried [[thyme]]\n| 2-3 [[bay leaves]]\n| 2 strips [[lemon]] peel\n| [[Sea salt]]\n| Freshly ground [[black pepper]]\n| [[Plain  flour]]\n\n}}\n\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n* Preheat oven to 175\u00b0C (350\u00b0F - gas 4).\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| If the butcher has not done so, tie the [[veal shanks]] around the middle with [[kitchen twine]]; this will keep them from falling apart during cooking.\n| Choose a heavy, covered roasting pan or [[Dutch oven]] which will just accommodate the [[veal shanks]] in one layer. Put the [[butter]], 2 tablespoons of the oil, the [[onions]], [[celery]] and [[carrots]] in the pan and [[saut\u00e9]] over medium heat until the vegetables have wilted, about 8 minutes. Add the [[Garlic|garlic]] and [[lemon peel]] and saut\u00e9 until they're fragrant, about 2 minutes more. Remove from the heat.\n| Meanwhile, heat the remaining oil in a skillet until it is near the smoking point. Lightly flour the [[veal shanks]] and slip them into the oil. Richly brown the [[veal shanks]] on both of the cut sides, then place them in the roasting pan on top of the vegetables.\n| Place the wine in the skillet and boil until reduced by one-half, [[deglaze]] the pan, scraping up any brown residue. Pour this over the [[veal shanks]].\n| Heat the [[beef stock]] to a boil in the skillet, whisking in the [[tomato puree]] and [[anchovies]]. Add this to the [[veal shanks]], along with the herbs, several grindings of [[pepper]], and a large pinch of [[salt]]. The liquid should cover &frac34; of the shanks. If not, add extra water.\n| Bring the pot to a simmer, cover, and place in the oven. Cook for approximately 2 hours, turning and basting the shanks every &frac12; hour. If you notice that the cooking liquids have nearly evaporated, add hot water, about &frac12; cup at a time. The veal is done when it is fork tender and falling from the bone.\n| Transfer the shanks to a platter, remove the strings, and cover to keep warm. If the sauce seems watery, as is probable, place the pan on the stove top over high heat and reduce the cooking liquid until the sauce has a thick, creamy consistency. Pour the sauce over the shanks and serve.\n}}\n== Chef's notes ==\n* The recipe calls for [[anchovies]], which enrich the finished sauce without adding a \"fishy\" flavour: don't omit them, even should you not be fond of anchovies.\n* Traditionally, the cooking sauce is finished with a mixture of [[Garlic|garlic]], [[lemon zest]] and [[parsley]] called ''Gremolata.'' It adds a burst of freshness to the finished dish and is highly recommended. [[Gremolata]] consists of the grated zest of one [[lemon]], one finely minced clove of [[Garlic|garlic]], and one tablespoon of finely chopped [[parsley]]. Add this mixture to the sauce at the end of the cooking, as it's being reduced.\n* Osso buco is almost ''always'' served with [[risotto]]&ndash;indeed; it's one of the few examples in Italian cooking where a starch is served with the main course and is a marriage that no man should put asunder. One may, for a change, substitute [[orzo]] or [[acini de pepe]] cooked in [[meat stock]] and finished with [[butter]] and [[Parmesan cheese]].\n===Pictured version===\nThis was a complete success, though a few notes are in order:\n\nAs always, the recipe was made with what we had 'in stock'.\n* 1 very thick steak was easily sufficient for 2\n* 1 big leek instead of the [[onions]]\n* 4 lovely thin [[carrots]] (two sliced, two left as-is)\n* 2 teaspoons of [[Marigold vegetable stock]] in two coffee mugs boiling water\n* 3 tablespoons of [[cornmeal]], I prefer it to [[flour]]\nThis went wonderfully with fresh crusty bread.\n==See also==\n* [[Slow roast recipes]]\n\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Beef recipes]]\n[[Category:Historic recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Italian recipes]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:Stews and casseroles]]\n[[Category:Veal recipes]]\n[[Category:Cooking with wine]]\n[[Category:Stewed, braised or pot roasted]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#vealshanks #gremolata #butter #celery #garlic #onion #beefstock #onions #carrots #tomato #carrot </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
