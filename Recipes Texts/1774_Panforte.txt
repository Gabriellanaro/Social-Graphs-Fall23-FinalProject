It comes in two varieties:\n\nDark - the top is coated in [[Spices|spices]] and contains candied [[Melon|melon]]\n\nWhite - the top is sprinkled with [[Sugar|sugar]]\n\nThe white sort is often called 'Panforte Margherita' and was so named in honour of the visit to Siena of Queen Margherita of Savoy in 1879.  It is this variety which is most commonly seen today and is the subject of this recipe.\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| 50g clear [[Honey|honey]], preferably [[Italian]] wildflower (millefiori)\n| 230g [[Muscovado sugar|muscovado sugar]]\n| 140g [[Plain flour|plain flour]]\n| 230g whole [[Almonds|almonds]], unpeeled\n| 350g [[Candied peel|candied peel]]\n| 3 [[Oranges|oranges]], [[Zest|zest]] only, [[Grated|grated]]\n| \u00bd teaspoon [[Ground cinnamon|ground cinnamon]]\n| \u00bc teaspoon [[Ground|ground]] [[Nutmeg|nutmeg]]\n| \u00bc teaspoon [[Ground cloves|ground cloves]]\n| \u00bc teaspoon [[Ground black pepper|ground black pepper]]\n| 70ml water\n| [[Rice]] paper, for lining the bottom of the [[Cake|cake]] tin\n| [[Icing Sugar|icing sugar]] for dusting\n}}\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n\n* Pre-heat the [[Oven|oven]] to  170\u00b0 C (gas 3), [fan oven 150\u00b0 C]\n\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| Lin the base of a 20cm / 8in [[Cake|cake]] tin with [[Rice|rice]] paper.\n| Line the sides with [[Greaseproof paper|greaseproof paper]] and grease with [[Butter|butter]] or [[Groundnut oil|groundnut oil]] (Vegans) or use [[Bake-O-Glide]].\n| In a large pan, melt the [[Honey|honey]] and [[Sugar|sugar]] over a medium heat - do not allow to burn.\n| In a bowl, mix all of the remaining ingredients, except the water and [[Icing Sugar|icing sugar]].\n| Once the mixture in the [[Saucepan|saucepan]] is bubbling, stir in the [[Fruit|fruit]] mixture and the water.\n| Carry on cooking until the mixture takes on a slightly sticky texture.\n| Pour into the [[Cake|cake]] tin and [[Bake|bake]] for about 35 minutes.\n| Allow to cool and dust with sifted [[Icing Sugar|icing sugar]].\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nCut into [[Wedges|wedges]] and serve as it is, with [[Tea|tea]] or [[Coffee|coffee]].
