It will knock all the air out of it. \n| Knock the [[Dough|dough]] around for a minute or until it has deflated. It is now ready to shape.\n| Heat an [[Oven|oven]] to 200C. \n| Cut the [[Dough|dough]] into 4 then roll out each piece into a flat thin round [[Pizza|pizza]] base.\n| Prick the pizza all over with a fork. This prevents it puffing up too much and burning while it is cooking.\n| Top each [[Pizza|pizza]] with 2 tablespoons of [[Tomato sauce|tomato sauce]], some [[Onions|onions]] rings, [[Pear|pear]] slices, some [[Gorgonzola]], 1 tablespoon of [[Walnuts|walnuts]]. \n| Lay the [[Pizzas|pizzas]] on [[baking tray]]s and [[Bake|bake]] in the [[Oven|oven]] for 15-20 minutes. You want to base to be golden and crispy and the [[Cheese|cheese]] to be melted and gooey.\n| When they have finished cook top with a handful of [[Rocket|rocket]] and a drizzle of [[Olive oil|olive oil]] and serve.\n}}\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Italian recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Cheese recipes]]\n[[Category:Fruit recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegetable recipes]]\n[[Category:Pizza recipes]]\n[[Category:British Onions recipes]]\n[[Category:Recipes from other sites]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n{{Template:British Onions attribution}}\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#dough #oliveoil #yeast #pizza #pearredonionandgorgonzolapizza #rocket #pear #gorgonzola #clingfilm #walnuts #pizzas </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
