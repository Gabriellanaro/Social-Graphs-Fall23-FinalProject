For the [[Panasonic SD-ZB2502 automatic breadmaker]], use menu option 22, pizza dough.\n\nThis is the recipe I use, it works well without or without the [[breadmaker]], though without the breadmaker I still cheat and use the [[food processor]] to mix it.\n\nThere is a good [[spicy tomato sauce for pizzas|spicy tomato sauce for pizzas here]] and another recipe that will use up your glut of home grown tomatoes, [[spicy tomato sauce for pizzas|here]].\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 1 level teaspoon [[dried yeast]]\n| 300 g (11 oz) [[strong white flour]]\n| 1 teaspoon [[sugar]], ''see [[Talk:Pizza dough|comments]]''\n| 15 g (1/2 oz) [[butter]] or [[olive oil]]\n| 1 teaspoon table [[salt]]\n| 160 ml water - or by weight instead of volume, 160 g water\n| 1 teaspoon dried [[oregano]]\n}}\n\n===Method===\n'''The easy way'''\n* Tip it all in the breadmaker, switch to ''dough'' or ''pizza'' setting, wait for an hour , remove the perfect [[dough]].\n* '''Recipe option code 22''' on the [[Panasonic SD-ZB2502 automatic breadmaker]]\n'''Another easy way'''\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Sift the flour into a bowl\n| Warm the water to body temperature, not hot, stir in the milk powder and salt\n| Take a few tablespoons of the warm water, add the sugar and yeast and leave in a [[warm place]] for 15 minutes.\n| Tip the flour into a food processor with a dough hook or plastic blade\n| Add the dried [[oregano]], butter, yeast mixture and the rest of the water\n| Knead until elastic and not too sticky, adjust with extra flour / water if required\n| Place in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with a damp tea-towel and leave in a [[warm place]] for two hours\n}}\n\n'''The hard way'''\n* Follow the steps above, hand kneading when it comes to the automated part.\n\n'''Make the pizza'''\n* Roll into two balls then roll out into two circles, about 20 cm (8\")\n* Prick the pizza all over with a fork. This prevents it puffing up too much and burning while it is cooking.\n* Transfer to a greased baking sheets and leave in a [[warm place]] to rise again (about 1 hour)\n* Follow your pizza recipe from here...\n\n===Baking in an oven===\nBake for 10 to 15 minutes at 220\u00b0 c (425\u00b0 F - Gas 7)\n\n===Cooking on a pizza stone===\nTo obtain a nice crispy pizza base, pre-bake the pizza base on a [[pizza stone]] under a very hot grill for 2 minutes a side.  Then remove and add the toppings and cook until the cheese is bubbling. Watch carefully though as they can quickly burn in the intense heat.\n\n===Chef's notes===\nAnother advantage of preparing pizza dough in the breadmaker is that once the dough cycle is complete, the breadmaker stays warm until it is switched off, giving the dough a good place to rise. ''True for the [[Panasonic breadmaker]] anyway.''\n\nThe Panasonic recipe suggests adding milk powder to the mix but I stopped doing that years ago and the pizzas are always perfect, so I've removed that from the above recipe.\n\n===How to alter the consistency of the pizza base===\nIf the pizza dough is rolled out and baked immediately, without giving time to rise a little (''my preferred method''), the pizza base has a chewy, doughy middle with a crunchy outside, especially if cooked on a [[pizza stone]].  If the pizza dough is rolled out and left to rise for 30 minutes or more, the pizza base is much more crunch and biscuity - it's your call!\n\n===Water measures given by Panasonic===\nThis recipe in my Panasonic breadmaker book originally gave the water quantity as 210 ml, however, the same recipe in a later breadmakers has the quantity reduced to 170ml and finally to 160ml which makes dough with a perfect consistency.\n===Alternative ingredients===\n\nMakes 4 pizzas.  Apparently, the use of sparkling water (Vichy is recommended) gives a crustier base.\n*10 g easy bake dried yeast\n*450 g OO grade pizza flour\n*1 teaspoon sugar\n*10 g salt\n*25 g olive oil (will work it out in ml later)\n*220 ml sparkling bottled water\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Pizza recipes|Dough]]\n[[Category:Italian recipes]]\n[[Category:Bread and baking]]\n[[Category:Breadmaker recipes]][[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#pizzadough #warmplace #dough #breadmaker #pizzastone #oregano #butter #oliveoil #panasonicbreadmaker #driedyeast #pizzas </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
