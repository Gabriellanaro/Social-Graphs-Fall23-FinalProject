It is one of the most common ways of cooking rice in Italy.\n\nIts origins are in North Italy, specifically Eastern Piedmont, Western Lombardy, and the Veneto, where [[Rice|rice]] paddies are abundant. It is one of the pillars of Milanese cuisine, of which [[Risotto alla Milanese|risotto alla Milanese]] is near the top!\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 1.5 [[Litres|litres]] (50 fl oz) good [[Beef stock|beef stock]]\n| 20 g (3/4 oz) [[Beef|beef]] [[Bone marrow|bone marrow]] - see your butcher for this!\n| 80g (3 oz) [[Butter|butter]]\n| 1 small [[Onion|onion]], peeled and chopped\n| 350 g (12 oz) [[Risotto rice|risotto rice]]\n| &#189; teaspoon [[Saffron strands|saffron strands]]\n| 80 g (3 oz) freshly [[Grated|grated]] [[Parmesan cheese]]\n| [[Sea Salt|sea salt]]\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| In one pan, bring the [[Stock|stock]] to the [[Boil|boil]] and then turn out the heat\n| Heat 50 g (2 oz)  of the [[Butter|butter]] and the [[Beef|beef]] [[Marrow|marrow]] in another pan and add the [[Onion|onion]].
