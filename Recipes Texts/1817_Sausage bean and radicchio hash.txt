The [[radicchio]] is a good example of this.  The spicy pork sausages and beans should go well with the bitter leaved radicchio.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| 3 [[Cloves of Garlic, peeled and crushed|cloves of garlic, peeled and crushed]]\n| 2 [[Red onions|red onions]], peeled and sliced\n| 2 tablespoons of [[Olive oil]]\n| Splash of [[red wine]] (optional)\n| 1 x 200g Mattessons [[Smoked pork|smoked pork]] horseshoe [[Sausage|sausage]], [[Sliced on the diagonal|sliced on the diagonal]]\n| 1 x 225g (8 oz) hot [[Chorizo sausage|chorizo sausage]], sliced\n| 1 x 400g can of [[Cannellini beans|cannellini beans]], rinsed well and drained\n| 1 x 400g can of [[Flageolet beans|flageolet beans]], rinsed well and drained\n| 2 x 400g tinned [[Tomatoes|tomatoes]]\n| 1 tablespoon [[Tomato puree|tomato puree]]\n| 300 ml (1/2 pint) [[Chicken stock|chicken stock]]\n| pinch of [[Chilli flakes|chilli flakes]]\n| pinch of mixed [[herbs]]\n| 1 tablespoon [[Tomato puree|tomato puree]]\n| [[Sea Salt|sea salt]] and [[Freshly ground black pepper|freshly ground black pepper]]\n| 1 450 g (1 lb) [[Radicchio|radicchio]], cored and [[Shredded|shredded]]\n}}\n\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| Heat the [[Olive oil|olive oil]] in a heavy based pan and add a good pinch of [[Black pepper|black pepper]]\n| Gently [[Saute|saute]] the [[Onions|onions]] for 5 minutes, add the [[Garlic|garlic]] for the last 2 minutes.

Reconstituted [[dried beans]] would be great providing you leave time to rehydrate them.\n\nI added a sliced up [[courgette]] 30 minutes before the end, as we had one spare. \n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Italian recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Spicy recipes]]\n[[Category:Grain and bean recipes]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:Pork recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegetable recipes]]\n[[Category:Pan fried]]\n[[Category:Abel and Cole veg box recipes]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#sausagebeanandradicchiohash #tomatopuree #radicchio #tomatoes #sausage #chickenstock #fry #chilliflakes #oliveoil #redwine #beans </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
