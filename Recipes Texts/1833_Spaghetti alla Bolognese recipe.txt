Place a metal [[Colander|colander]] over the pan containing the spaghetti to warm it up.\n| When the [[Spaghetti|spaghetti]] is cooked, remove the [[Colander|colander]] and place over ab large bowl or the sink. \n| Drain the [[Pasta|pasta]] and plate it immediately.\n| Cover with the [[Sauce|sauce]] and serve, sprinkled with [[Grated|grated]] [[Parmesan]] if desired.\n}}\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:In the pan.jpg|thumb|300px|right|In the pan\nImage:Diced herbs and vegetables.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Diced herbs and vegetables\n</gallery>\n===Serving suggestions===\nGreat on its own, but decent [[Bread|bread]] and a crisp [[Salad|salad]] would make excellent accompaniments for the hungry or greedy.\n===Variations===\nI don't think that you can vary this recipe too much and still call it '[[Spaghetti]] alla Bolognese'.  The Italians seem to have a different name for each variation!\n===Chef's notes===\nI think you can use any [[Pasta|pasta]] of the [[Spaghetti|spaghetti]] type, but do avoid thick, short pasta such as penne, [[Macaroni|macaroni]] etc as the [[Sauce|sauce]] is not suited to it.\n\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes|Spaghetti alla bolognese]]\n[[Category:Beef recipes|Spaghetti alla bolognese]]\n[[Category:Italian recipes|Spaghetti alla bolognese]]\n[[Category:Main courses|Spaghetti alla bolognese]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes|Spaghetti alla bolognese]]\n[[Category:Pasta recipes|Spaghetti alla bolognese]]\n[[Category:Vegetable recipes|Spaghetti alla bolognese]]\n[[Category:Boiled or simmered]][[Category:Pan fried]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#spaghetti #diced #spaghettiallabologneserecipe #celery #garlic #parsley #sauce #colander #beef #onions #simmer </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
