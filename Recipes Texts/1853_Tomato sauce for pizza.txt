Half a plastic cup is enough for 2 large pizzas. \n\nThere is a good basic [[pizza dough|pizza dough recipe here]].\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 30 ml [[olive oil]]\n| 1 [[onion]], peeled and chopped\n| 2 [[Garlic|garlic]] cloves, crushed\n| &#189; teaspoon [[chili pepper]] flakes\n| Pinch [[chili powder]]\n| 90 ml [[red wine]]\n| Dash of [[sherry vinegar]]\n| 1 tablespoon [[tomato puree]]\n| 1 x 400 g can peeled [[plum tomatoes]], chopped\n| Big handful [[basil leaves]], torn\n| 2 teaspoons [[dried]] [[oregano]]\n| sprig fresh [[thyme leaves]],\n| 1 teaspoon [[demerara sugar]]\n| 1 tablespoon [[Parmesan cheese]], freshly [[grated]]\n| [[Salt]] and [[freshly ground black pepper]] to taste\n}}\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Tomato sauce for pizza recipe.jpg|Tomato sauce for pizza\nImage:Tomato sauce for pizza slow cooker.jpg|Reducing in a [[slow cooker]]\nImage:Frozen pizza topping.jpg|Frozen in batches, enough here for 20 large pizzas!\n</gallery>\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Heat the [[oil]] in a pan and add the [[Garlic|garlic]], [[chili flakes]], [[chili powder]] and [[onions]] and [[fry]] gently until translucent, about 4 minutes\n| Add the [[paprika powder]], [[red wine]] and [[sherry vinegar]] and [[simmer]] to reduce by half\n| Add the chopped [[tomatoes]] to the pan with the [[tomato puree]] and bring to the [[boil]]\n| Add the remaining [[herbs]], reduce and [[simmer]] for 30 minutes\n| Pour the sauce into a [[food processor]] with a blade and blitz to a puree\n| ''or'', if you have a [[stick blender]], a few minutes with that will have the same effect, ideal if you're using a [[slow cooker]].  \n| Return to the pan and add the [[sugar]] and [[Parmesan cheese]] and cook for a further 15 minutes\n| Season with [[salt]] and [[pepper]], the final consistency should be a paste not runny.  Reduce a little more if required.\n| Allow to cool\n}}\n===Chef's tip===\nRecently I made a huge batch of pizza topping with this years' surplus [[tomatoes]] with the intention to [[vacuum pack]] them into single [[pizza]] portions. I used the basic procedure as above, but for the reducing stage, added the sauce to a [[slow cooker]] on high to 12 hours, uncovered (or until the sauce reaches a nice thick consistency).  The sauce was then frozen into about half full paper coffee and then [[vacuum packed]].  An absolute success.   \n\nIf you are making the sauce ahead of the pizzas and it needs further reduction, just remove from the heat and leave to dry  out a little, naturally.  This works especially well in a large frying pan.\n\nA brilliant, but rather obvious idea that has only come to me recently, is to make double the amount, bag it up and freeze it in one or two pizza portions.  Home made pizzas are great, but sometimes it's too much hassle to have to make the sauce as well.\n\nBottled bolognese type sauce makes a good very pizza topping with very little effort. Freeze the remainder in pizza portion sized bags for the next pizza making session.\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Pizza recipes]]\n[[Category:Italian recipes]]\n[[Category:Dips and sauces]]\n[[Category:Vegetable recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n[[Category:Favourite recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#tomatosauceforpizza #slowcooker #garlic #tomatopuree #sherryvinegar #parmesancheese #tomatoes #pizzas #chilipowder #simmer #redwine </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
