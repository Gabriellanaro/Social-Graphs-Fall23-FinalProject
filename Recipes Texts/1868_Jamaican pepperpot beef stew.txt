I think this is better though!\n\nThis recipe is also highly suited for use in a [[Slow cooker|slow cooker]] - cook on low for about 4 hours.\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| 2 tablespoons [[Plain flour|plain flour]]\n| 1 teaspoon [[Ground ginger powder|ground ginger powder]]\n| 1 teaspoon [[Sea Salt|sea salt]]\n| 1 teaspoon [[Freshly ground black pepper|freshly ground black pepper]]\n| 900g [[Stewing steak|stewing steak]], cubed\n| 2 tablespoons [[Olive oil|olive oil]]\n| 400g tinned [[Tomatoes|tomatoes]]\n| 100g fresh [[Button mushrooms|button mushrooms]], sliced\n| 1 teaspoon [[Hot chilli sauce|hot chilli sauce]] [or to taste]\n| 1 tablespoon [[Worcestershire sauce]]\n| 1 heaped tablespoon soft [[Brown sugar|brown sugar]] or [[Jaggery|jaggery]]\n| 2 tablespoons [[Red wine vinegar|red wine vinegar]]\n| 4 [[Cloves of Garlic, peeled and crushed|cloves of garlic, peeled and crushed]]\n| 1 [[Bay leaf|bay leaf]]\n| 1 Stick of [[cinnamon]]\n}}\n====to serve====\n{{RecipeIngredientsNB\n| 1 tablespoon chopped [[Parsley|parsley]]\n}}\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n\n* Preheat your [[Oven|oven]] to 160\u00b0 C (325\u00b0 F - gas 3), [fan oven 140\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]\n* If using a [[Slow cooker|slow cooker]] set to low.\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Pepperpot_end_cooking.jpg|A version with added beans at the end of 4 hours cooking\nImage:Pepperpot_start_cooking.jpg|Pepperpot at the start of the cooking process\nImage:Meat_coated_using_lock_and_lock_box.jpg|Meat coated with seasoned flour (using Lock & Lock box)\n</gallery>\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| Mix the [[Flour|flour]], [[Ground ginger|ground ginger]], [[Salt|salt]] and [[Pepper|pepper]] together and mix well - I use a [[Mortar and pestle|mortar and pestle]] to break down the [[Sea Salt|sea salt]].\n| Dredge the [[Steak|steak]] in the seasoned [[Flour|flour]] to coat well. A really good way to do this is add the seasoned flour and the meat to a [[Lock & Lock box]], close the lid and shake like mad.  As you can see from the picture it does a good job!\n| Heat the [[Oil|oil]] and [[Fry|fry]] the [[Meat|meat]] in batches until [[Browned|browned]].  Add a little more oil if needed.\n| Tip everything, including any left over seasoned [[Flour|flour]], into a lidded [[Oven-proof casserole dish|oven-proof casserole dish]] and mix well.\n| Cook for 3.5 hours at 160\u00b0 C (325\u00b0 F)\n| Remove the [[Bay leaf|bay leaf]] before serving.\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nSprinkle with the chopped [[Parsley|parsley]] and serve with [[Rice|rice]] or [[Potatoes|potatoes]] and [[Dumplings|dumplings]] and a [[Green vegetable|green vegetable]].\n===Variations===\nI used 530g 1 pack of [[Stewing|stewing]] [[Beef|beef]] and 1 440g pack of stewing beef and [[Kidneys|kidneys]], mixed. I also used 6 large cloves of garlic and added a small glass of [[red wine]] as, unusually, there was some left over from the night before!\n\nAs this was so nice, I made a second batch using [[steak]] and [[kidneys]] and to make it go further as it is quite rich, I added a can of drained [[kidney beans]] and 2 cans of tinned tomatoes. Instead of [[chili sauce]] I used 2 small red [[chillies]] (de-seeded) and one [[Indian green chilli]] including seeds.\n===See also===\n* [[Pepperpot|Jamaican pepperpot beef and vegetables recipe]]\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Jamaican recipes]]\n[[Category:Historic recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Spicy recipes]]\n[[Category:Beef recipes]]\n[[Category:Garlic recipes]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:Offal recipes]]\n[[Category:Slow cooker recipes]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n[[Category:Slow cooked]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#flour #kidneys #parsley #bayleaf #steak #jamaicanpepperpotbeefstew #dumplings #slowcooker #greenvegetable #chillies #redwinevinegar </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
