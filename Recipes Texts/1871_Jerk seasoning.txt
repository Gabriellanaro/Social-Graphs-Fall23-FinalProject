Grind the spices yourself in a [[Coffee grinder|coffee grinder]] to ensure you get fresh powerful flavours.\n===Adjustments from the Jamie's television recipe===\nI have adjusted the recipe from that seen on the TV program as I thought it was too liquid and way too 'clovey', although it was brilliant.  By the way, Jamie's original was 2 tablespoons of [[clove buds]], 250 ml [[dark rum]], 250 ml [[malt vinegar]].\n</dev>\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 6 [[Bay leaves|bay leaves]]\n| 2 tablespoons freshly ground [[Cinnamon|cinnamon]]\n| 2 tablespoons ground allspice\n| 2 level teaspoons of clove buds\n| 8 [[habanero chillies]] or [[Scotch bonnet chillies]] or of course any other types of [[Chillies|chillies]] of your choice\n|* I could not get [[habaneroes|habaneros]] so I used 16 medium sized (5 cm) red [[chillies]], the anonymous types that most supermarkets sell. \n| 2 tablespoons freshly grated [[Nutmeg|nutmeg]], (roughly 1 large nutmeg before grating)\n| 8 [[Cloves|cloves]] of [[Garlic|garlic]], peeled\n| 1 tablespoon [[Sea salt|sea salt]]\n| 1 tablespoon freshly ground [[Black pepper|black pepper]]\n| 1 tablespoon freshly ground juniper berries\n| 3 tablespoons freshly picked [[Thyme leaves|thyme leaves]]\n| 200 ml [[dark rum]]\n| 200 ml [[Malt vinegar|malt vinegar]]\n| 2 [[Red onions|red onions]], peeled and quartered. White onions are fine too.\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Add everything but the [[rum]], [[Vinegar|vinegar]] and [[Onions|onions]] to a food processor with a metal blade and blitz to a paste\n| Add the [[Onions|onions]], rum and [[Vinegar|vinegar]] and blitz until they are totally combined\n| Store in [[sterilised]] bottles\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nBrush over meat, fish or poultry before cooking.\n\nFor hams, mix in a tablespoon of [[honey]] or [[marmalade]] and brush or spoon over all visible surfaces for the last 30 minutes of cooking.\n===Chef's notes===\nI marinated [[pan fried breaded pork fillets]] for 3 hours in a ladleful of this jerk seasoning and they were brilliant.  As was [[Marmalade glazed jerk gammon]], a version of [[marmalade ham]] that I made using this recipe.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Jerk recipes]]\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Barbecue recipes]]\n[[Category:Chilli pepper recipes]]\n[[Category:Dips and sauces]]\n[[Category:Historic recipes]]\n[[Category:Marinades dressings and butters]]\n[[Category:North African recipes]]\n[[Category:Jamaican recipes\u200e]]\n[[Category:Pickles and preserves]]\n[[Category:Spicy recipes]]\n[[Category:Uncooked]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#jerkseasoning #darkrum #chillies #maltvinegar #vinegar #onions #garlic #habaneroes #honey #bayleaves #cinnamon </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
