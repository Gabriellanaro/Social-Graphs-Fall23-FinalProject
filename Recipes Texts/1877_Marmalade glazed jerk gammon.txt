I made the [[Jerk marinade|jerk marinade]] yesterday and have already tried it with [[pan fried pork fillets]] and it was great.\n\nI found the [[Jerk marinade|jerk marinade]] a bit heavy on the [[Cloves|cloves]], so I have omitted the cloves in the [[Boiling|boiling]] stage.\n\nThis is a little long winded and it obviously takes a fair bit of planning, but it is worth doing, that I promise!\n\n\n'''Boiling the gammon'''\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 1.4 kg [[Gammon|gammon]] (unsmoked) - I chose one with very little skin as it will be discarded after [[Boiling|boiling]]\n| ''If you have a shrink-wrapped gammon, be sure to remove the inner plastic wrapping so the marinade can penetrate properly.''\n| big bunch of [[Parsley|parsley]]\n| 15 [[Peppercorns|peppercorns]]\n| A big handful of [[Orange|Chinese preserved orange peel]]\n| Big [[Stick of cinnamon|stick of cinnamon]]\n}}\n'''Marinade stage'''\n{{RecipeIngredientsNB\n| 250 ml (3 ladles-full) of [[jerk marinade]]\n}}\n'''Roasting stage'''\n{{RecipeIngredientsNB\n| 3 tablespoons of [[Rhubarb and ginger preserve]] (or a similar [[marmalade]])\n| 10 ml [[rum]]\n}}\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Marmalade glazed jerk gammon recipe.jpg|Carved\nImage:Marmalade glazed jerk gammon basting.jpg|Basting\nImage:Marmalade glazed jerk gammon marinading.jpg|Marinading\nImage:Marmalade glazed jerk gammon boiling ingredients.jpg|Ingredients for the boiling stage (I reduced the number of peppercorns after the picture was taken)\n\n</gallery>\n===Method===\n'''Boiling'''\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Place the gammon and the boiling ingredients in a large pan and just cover with boiling water\n| Fast simmer for about an hour\n| remove, drain, and allow to cool\n| Slice the skin off and discard.  Try to leave a layer of fat on the meat\n| Score the fat in a criss-cross pattern, trying not to cut into the meat\n}}\n'''Marinading'''\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Marinade in a cool place for as long as you can - I went for 4 days. Keep in a cool place and in a sealed container if you have adventurous cats!\n| If you get the chance, turn the gammon every day and spoon the marinade over the meat\n}}\n'''Roasting'''\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Preheat the oven to 200\u00b0 C (400\u00b0 F - gas 6)\n| Put the gammon in a deep [[roasting tray]] and [[roast]] for 1 hour 50 minutes in total\n| Mix the [[rhubarb]] preserve or [[marmalade]] with a splash of [[rum]] to liquify it a little\n| After 1 hour 20 minutes has expired, take the tray out and [[deglaze]] the pan with a splash of rum\n| Spread the preserve over the surface of the gammon and roast for another 30 minutes or so.  Check it every 8 minutes and re-baste with the preserve\n| Remove, rest for 10 minutes and serve\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe hot with [[boiled potatoes]], [[garden peas]], [[pease pudding]] and a sprinkling of [[parsley]]\n===Variations===\nVary the ingredients that you add in the [[Boiling|boiling]] stage to your own taste.  [[Carrots]], [[leeks]], [[Parsnip|parsnip]] are all good flavour enhancers.\n\nJamie made his with marmalade but I thought the rhubarb and ginger preserve went better with the warm spices.  Experiment with your favourite preserve.\n\n===Chef's note===\n[[Meat cooking time calculator|Cooking times]] will vary for larger joints, and after tasting this I would recommend the biggest joint you can afford!\n\nIf you have a [[Jaccard meat tenderiser]], stab the joint all over with it so the marinade can penetrate really well.\n===Notes on gammon cooking times===\nUsually a gammon joint is cooked by boiling, either in a large saucepan (about 1.5 hours to 2.5 hours depending upon weight), or a quicker method is to cook in a [[pressure cooker]] (1 hour). After this process, the gammon will be cooked and perfectly safe to eat, however, often the gammon is then finished by [[roasted]] with a glaze ([[honey]], [[marmalade]], [[Branston pickle]], etc.  This finishing process does make for an extended cooking time but it does give an exceptional finish. \n\n{{GammonRecipes}}\n{{Template:PeelingGinger}}\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes|Gammon]]\n[[Category:Main courses|Gammon]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes|Gammon]]\n[[Category:Pork recipes|Gammon]]\n[[Category:Jamaican recipes\u200e|Gammon]]\n[[Category:Fruit recipes]]\n[[Category:Boiled or simmered]][[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#marmaladeglazedjerkgammon #boiling #jerkmarinade #marmalade #rum #parsley #branstonpickle #roasted #orange #peasepudding #rhubarb </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
