Kimchi is the most common banchan, or side dish eaten at every Korean meal with [[rice]]. Kimchi is also a common ingredient and combined with other ingredients to make dishes such as [[kimchi stew]] ([[kimchi jjigae]]) and kimchi fried rice (kimchi bokkeumbap). Kimchi is so common in Korea cuisine that the Korea Aerospace Research Institute (KARI) developed space kimchi to accompany the first Korean astronaut to the Russian-manned space ship Soyuz.\n===Varieties of kimchi===\nKimchi varieties are determined by the main [[vegetable]] ingredients and the mix of seasonings used to flavour the kimchi. The most popular type of kimchi is the baechu (a type of [[Chinese cabbage]]) variety but there are many regional and seasonal varieties. Popular variants include ggakdugi which is a kimchi made with cubed [[radishes]], pa kimchi (made with [[spring onions]]),chonggakkimchi and oisobaegi, a [[cucumber]] kimchi with hot and spicy seasonings. Ggaennip kimchi features layers of [[perilla leaves]] marinated in [[soy sauce]] and [[vinegar]] and other spices.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 1 whole head of [[Napa cabbage|napa cabbage]] (some supermarkets label as Chines [[Lettuce|lettuce]])\n| 4.5 tablespoons [[Table salt|table salt]]\n| 3 tablespoons [[ko choo kah rhoo]] - (ground chilli flakes)\n| 5 [[Fat|fat]] Cloves of [[Garlic|garlic]]\n| Equal volume of [[Fresh ginger|fresh ginger]], [[Grated|grated]]\n| &#189; of a ripe [[Pear|pear]], peeled, cored and roughly chopped\n| &#189; of a ripe sweet [[Apple|apple]], peeled, cored and roughly chopped\n| &#189; a medium [[Onion|onion]], peeled and roughly chopped \n| 2 tablespoons of [[Nam pla|nam pla]]\n| 3 large or 5 small [[Spring onions, chopped|spring onions, chopped]]\n\n}}\n\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n* Bear in mind that the [[Cabbage|cabbage]] needs to sit in the [[Salted|salted]] water for 5 hours before you make the [[Kimchi|kimchi]].\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Chop the [[Cabbage|cabbage]] into bite-sized pieces - it will further reduce in size after dehydrating\n| Add the [[Salt|salt]] to about 250 ml of warm water and mix really well. ''the quantity is not that important as it will all be discarded.''\n| Place the [[Cabbage|cabbage]] pieces in a large bowl, pour over the [[Salt|salt]] liquid and toss the cabbage in the mixture.\n| Cover with a [[Tea-towel|tea-towel]] and leave at room temperature for about 5 hours, turning once or twice.\n| After 5 hours, using a [[Colander|colander]], rinse the [[Cabbage|cabbage]] under a cold running tap to wash off all the [[Salt|salt]]. Drain and set to one side.\n| Mix the [[Ground|ground]] [[Chilli flakes|chilli flakes]] with about 5 or 6 tablespoons of water and mix to a paste.\n| Add the [[Chilli|chilli]] paste, [[Garlic|garlic]], [[Ginger|ginger]], [[Apple|apple]], [[Pear|pear]] and [[Onion|onion]] to a [[Food processor|food processor]] with a blade and bland to a paste.  Add a little water if it makes it easier to blend.\n| Add 2 tablespoons of [[Nam pla|nam pla]] to the [[Cabbage|cabbage]] together with the [[Chopped spring onions|chopped spring onions]] and [[Garlic|garlic]]-[[Chilli|chilli]] paste.\n| Add 250 ml of cold water and wearing rubber gloves to protect your hands, mix really well so everything is evenly combined.\n| Pack the mixture into a [[Sterilised|sterilised]] [[Kilner|kilner]]-type jar.  Don't fill right to the top. You don't need as much room as pictured.  It was the only jar I had, a smaller one would have done equally well.\n| Don't close the lid, just cover with a [[Tea-towel|tea-towel]] and leave for 24 hours at room temperature to [[Ferment|ferment]].\n| After 24 hours, seal and store in the [[Refrigerator|refrigerator]] where it will continue to [[Ferment|ferment]].\n| It should last for about 1 month, the longer it is kept, the more sour it will become.  Apparently, the best kimchi to use for [[kimchi jjigae]] is old, sour kimchi.\n}}\n===Servings===\nServings: 50 - Makes 1 jar - about 1 litre, depending up the size of the [[Cabbage|cabbage]]\n===Illustrated stages===\n<gallery widths=270px heights=270px perrow=5>\nImage:Kimchi, just bottled.jpg|Just bottled, ready to ferment\nImage:Kimchi ready to bottle.jpg|Kimchi, ready to bottle\nImage:Mix well using rubber gloves.jpg|Mix well using rubber gloves\nImage:Crushed chilli flakes mixed with water.jpg|[[ko choo kah rhoo]], mixed with water\nImage:Kimchi after 5 hours.jpg|Napa cabbage after salting for 5 hours\nImage:Napa cabbage, salted.jpg|Napa cabbage in salt solution\nImage:Napa cabbage and salt solution.jpg|Napa cabbage and salt solution\nImage:Napa cabbage.jpg|Napa cabbage (Chinese lettuce)\n</gallery>\n{{Template:PeelingGinger}}\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Korean recipes]]\n[[Category:Accompaniments]]\n[[Category:Snacks and light bites]]\n[[Category:Pickles and preserves]]\n[[Category:Spicy recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegan recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegetable recipes]]\n[[Category:Ingredients]]\n[[Category:Prepared foods]]\n[[Category:Vegetables]]\n[[Category:Uncooked]]\n[[Category:Pickled]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#cabbage #garlic #ferment #onion #pear #nampla #apple #kimchijjigae #kimchirecipe #chilli #refrigerator </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
