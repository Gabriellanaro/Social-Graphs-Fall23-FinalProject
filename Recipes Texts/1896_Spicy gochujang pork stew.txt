This is the first result.\n\nI would normally use [[pork shoulder]] or a similar cut for this type of recipe, but as I had some fatty gammon available I used that.\n\nI have documented this so I have a good record which I can use to modify and improve this recipe.   I fear this first experiment may be too spicy!\n\nIt transpires that my fears were well grounded.  On tasting the [[Stew|stew]] it was way too hot to eat so I made an attempt to rescue the meal by draining and  discarding the existing [[Sauce|sauce]] and adding a can of chopped [[Tomatoes|tomatoes]] for the final 30 minutes.  The result was rather good and much less hot.\n\nThe ingredients below are the modified version!\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| 2 small [[Gammon steaks|gammon steaks]] with plenty of [[Fat|fat]], sliced\n| 1 tablespoon [[Olive oil|olive oil]]\n| 1 large [[Leek|leek]], cleaned and chopped\n| 1 small [[Cabbage|cabbage]], chopped\n| 250 ml [[Chicken stock|chicken stock]]\n}}\n====marinade====\n{{RecipeIngredientsNB\n| 1 teaspoon [[Szechuan peppercorns]], crushed\n| 2 teaspoons of [[Taste Sensation Tomato powder|taste sensation tomato powder]]\n| &#189; of a teaspoon of [[Taste Sensation Lime Juice Powder]]\n| 1 bulb of [[Garlic|garlic]], peeled, half chopped, half crushed\n| 2 tablespoons [[Gochujang|gochujang]]\n| 4 tablespoons [[Fresh ginger|fresh ginger]], sliced\n}}\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n\n* [[Marinade]] the [[Gammon|gammon]] slices for 12 to 24 hours in the spicy marinade.\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Gochujang pork marinade.jpg|Gochujang Pork, marinading\nImage:Gochujang pork original ingredients.jpg.jpg|The original ingredients for Gochujang Pork - see notes\n</gallery>\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| [[Fry]] the chopped [[Leeks|leeks]] in the [[Olive oil|olive oil]] for 5 minutes\n| To your [[Slow Cooker|slow cooker]], add the cooked [[Leeks|leeks]], the [[Marinade|marinade]]d [[Pork|pork]] together with the marinade, the [[Chicken stock|chicken stock]], chopped [[Cabbage|cabbage]].\n| Slow cook on medium heat for about 12 hours, adding extra water to keep it 'soupy'\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe with [[Noodles|noodles]] and [[microwaved popadums]]\n===Recipe source===\n\n* Based on a Food Network [[Korean]] food special featuring John Torode\n===Chef's notes===\nThe original ingredients used, pictured, made the recipe far too hot.
