[[Fry]] [[Onion|onion]].  After a few minutes add Crushed [[Garlic|garlic]].  Cover and continue [[Frying|frying]] until [[Onions|onions]] are translucent.\n| Add [[Meat|meat]] and [[Brown|brown]].\n| Add remaining ingredients and seasoning.\n| Bring to [[Boil|boil]].  Lower heat and [[Simmer|simmer]] for  30mins to 1 hour, depending on how much you've made.\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\n\nServe with [[Tortillas|tortillas]], [[Rice|rice]] or crusty [[Bread|bread]] and a side [[Salad|salad]].\n\n===Variations===\n\nBy increasing the proportion of [[Beans|beans]] and [[Vegetables|vegetables]], one pack of [[Meat|meat]] can be stretched to ten or twelve servings.  If you do this, increase the proportion of [[Herbs|herbs]], [[Spices|spices]] and [[Chocolate|chocolate]] accordingly.  If you don't want to use chocolate (which really is the secret ingredient), you can substitute a little [[White sugar|white sugar]] to bring out the flavour of the [[Tomatoes|tomatoes]].\n\nIf you don't like food too spicy, cut down the green [[Chili|chili]] content.  I make it for my young son in this way and he loves it with [[Rice|rice]].\n\n===Chef's tip===\n\nI make a big pot a couple of times a year and each time freeze 15 - 18 double portions that can be microwaved quickly to give us a hot meal in about 15 mins at the end of the working day.  \n\nIf you use low-[[Fat|fat]] [[Beef|beef]], this meal is a healthy option, as it has no other source of [[saturated fat]] apart from the small amount of [[Chocolate|chocolate]].\n\n==See also==\n* {{ChiliConCarne}}\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Beef recipes]]\n[[Category:Chilli pepper recipes|Chicken]]\n[[Category:Latin American recipes]]\n[[Category:North American recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:Spicy recipes]]\n[[Category:Tex-Mex recipes]]\n[[Category:Boiled or simmered]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#beef #chocolate #onion #tomatoes #rice #vegetables #garlic #simmer #frying #tortillas #dried </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
