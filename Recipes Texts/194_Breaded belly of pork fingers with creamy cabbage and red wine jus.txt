It looked interesting so I thought I would make my own version.\n\nIt was an astounding success and will become one of my [[:Category:Favourite recipes|favourite recipes]].\n\nBasically the [[Pork belly|pork belly]] is slow [[Roasted|roasted]] in [[Vegetables|vegetables]] and half a bottle of [[Red wine|red wine]].  Then the [[Pork|pork]] belly is pressed under weights, cut into strips, [[Breaded|breaded]] and [[Pan fried|pan fried]]. The whole process is quite a palava, though definitely worth the trouble.  Because of this I decided to buy 2 [[Pork bellies|pork bellies]] and slow cook them together.  At about \u00a35.00 each it seems to make financial sense as well as time saving.  The spare pork belly has been [[Vacuum packed|vacuum packed]] and will be used to make this recipe again in the very near future.\n\nAs far as the [[Vegetables|vegetables]] are concerned, they are to flavour the [[Meat|meat]] and to enrich the [[Stock|stock]], use whatever you have handy, there is no fixed rule for what to use. They will be discarded after cooking (and  fed to our [[Chickens|chickens]] in this case)  I often [[Freeze|freeze]] unused fresh vegetables; this is an idea recipe in which to use them up.\n\nThe [[Pork belly|pork belly]], [[Cabbage|cabbage]] and [[red wine]] jus can be all be cooked beforehand finally reheated while the [[Pork|pork]] is being [[Fried|fried]].\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n}}\n====to slow cook the pork belly====\n{{RecipeIngredientsNB\n| ''use whatever similar [[Vegetables|vegetables]] you have to [[Hand|hand]]''\n| 2 kg boneless [[Pork bellies|pork bellies]], skin removed\n| 1 [[Leek|leek]], chopped into rings\n| 4 [[Cloves of garlic|cloves of garlic]], unpeeled and smashed under a knife\n| 2 sticks of [[Celery|celery]], with leaves if possible, chopped into moons\n| 2 [[Carrots|carrots]], [[Split|split]] down the middle\n| 1 [[Parsnip|parsnip]], guess, [[Split|split]] down the middle\n| Half a [[Turnip|turnip]], cut into chunks\n| A handful of [[Tomatoes|tomatoes]], halved\n| A bunch of [[Fresh herbs|fresh herbs]], [[Thyme|thyme]] and [[Sage|sage]] are good with this\n| 300 ml [[Red wine|red wine]]\n| 400 ml of [[Chicken stock|chicken stock]]\n| Splash of [[Light soy sauce|light soy sauce]]\n| Pinch of [[Chilli powder|chilli powder]]\n| A pinch of [[Sea Salt|sea salt]] and [[Freshly ground black pepper|freshly ground black pepper]]\n}}\n==== for the breaded pork fingers====\n{{RecipeIngredientsNB\n| Half a [[Cup|cup]] of [[Plain flour|plain flour]]\n| Half a teaspoon of [[Tex-Mex seasoning]] [or whatever you fancy to give them a little lift]\n| 2 large [[Eggs|eggs]], beaten\n| 1 [[Cup|cup]] of [[Panko]] [[Breadcrumbs|breadcrumbs]]\n| [[Rapeseed oil]] for shallow [[Frying|frying]]\n}}\n====for the creamy cabbage====\n{{RecipeIngredientsNB\n| 1 small [[Savoy cabbage]]\n| 300 ml pot of [[Single Cream|single cream]]\n| Freshly chopped [[Parsley|parsley]]\n| [[Salt]] and [[Pepper|pepper]]\n}}\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n\n* Preheat the [[Oven|oven]] to 160\u00b0 C (32\u00b0 F - gas 3), [fan oven 140\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]\n\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| [[Sautee]] the [[Leeks|leeks]] (or [[Onions|onions]]), [[Celery|celery]] and [[Garlic|garlic]] in a little [[Olive oil|olive oil]] for a few minutes\n| Add the [[Tomatoes|tomatoes]] and [[Red wine|red wine]] and heat for 3 or 4 minutes\n| Place the chopped [[Vegetables|vegetables]] in the base of a [[Roasting tray|roasting tray]], large enough to accommodate both [[Pork bellies|pork bellies]]\n| Arrange the [[Fresh herbs|fresh herbs]] over the [[Vegetables|vegetables]] and sprinkle with [[Salt|salt]] and [[Pepper|pepper]]\n| Sit the [[Pork bellies|pork bellies]], on top of the [[Vegetables|vegetables]], fatty side to the top\n| Pour the [[Wine|wine]] mixture over the [[Pork bellies|pork bellies]]\n| Pour the [[Stock|stock]] around the side of the [[Pork|pork]]\n| Cover with just enough [[Tin foil|tin foil]] to stop the [[Pork|pork]] from [[Drying|drying]] out.
