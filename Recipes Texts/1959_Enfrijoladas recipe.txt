The [[tortillas]] are slightly [[fried]] and filled with [[frijoles refritos]] ([[refried beans]]) and [[pork]], or in this recipe spicy [[chorizo]].  I cheated with the refried beans as I didn't have time to soak them so I used canned, which are ok if but a little too salty.  I used [[Emmental cheese]], which is not authentic but I though it would work well. It did. This dish was a huge success.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 8 [[corn tortillas]]\n| 2 cans refried beans (or [[Refried beans recipe|homemade refried beans]])\n| 110 g (4 oz) [[grated]] [[Emmenthal cheese]], [[Monterey Jack]] or [[Cheddar cheese]]\n| 1/2 a small jar of [[Jalape\u00f1os|pickled jalape\u00f1os chillies]] or to taste\n| 150 ml to 200 ml (1/4 pint +) of [[beef stock|beef]] or [[vegetable stock]] \n| 120 g (4 oz) or a packet of spicy [[chorizo]], sliced\n| A handful of fresh [[coriander]], chopped\n| 8 tablespoons [[sour cream]]\n| [[Garlic olive oil]] for frying the [[corn tortillas]]\n\n}}\n\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n* Preheat the oven to 180\u00b0 C (350\u00b0 F - gas 4)\n\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| In a frying pan heat a few drops of [[garlic olive oil]] and fry each [[tortilla]] for a minute or so a side.\n| So you don't use too much oil, turn the first one over after a minute, put the next uncooked one on top of this to soak a little of the oil, flip them both. Remove the cooked one and repeat until they are all done. Add a few more drops of olive oil if the pan is too dry.\n| Divide the [[chorizo]] the cold contents of one cans of [[refried beans]] and layer each [[tortilla]] with an equal share as in the photo.\n| Lay them in an ovenproof dish\n| Heat the remaining tin of beans and add enough [[stock]] to make them ''pourable''. This way the bean ''sauce'' can get between the tortillas. Stir in the [[pickled jalape\u00f1os]]\n| Pour the bean mixture between the [[tortillas]], add a drizzle of [[garlic olive oil]] over the top and cover with the grated cheese\n| Bake in the over for 30 minutes and finish under the grill if you like your cheese toasty\n}}\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Enfrijoladas recipe 1.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Fill each tortilla with chorizo and refried beans\nImage:Grapefruit salsa.jpg|thumb|300px|right|[[Grapefruit salsa]]\n</gallery>\n===Serving suggestions===\n\nGarnish with a dollop of [[sour cream]] on top and a sprinkle of coriander.\n\nDon your big hat and serve with a [[grapefruit salsa]] or [[curtido]] and a glass of ice-cold San Miguel!\n\n''The Mexican way: A tip from one of our Mexican visitors'' - You can also fill your enfrijoladas with shredded chicken and sprinkle some chopped or thinly sliced onion on top.  \n\n{{Tortillas-See also}}\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Cheese recipes]]\n[[Category:Chilli pepper recipes]]\n[[Category:Latin American recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:Pork recipes]]\n[[Category:Grain and bean recipes]]\n[[Category:Spicy recipes]]\n[[Category:Starters]]\n[[Category:Tex-Mex recipes]]\n[[Category:North American recipes]]\n[[Category:Favourite recipes]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#enfrijoladasrecipe #chorizo #garlicoliveoil #tortilla #grapefruitsalsa #corntortillas #tortillas #refriedbeans #sourcream #montereyjack #cheddarcheese </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
