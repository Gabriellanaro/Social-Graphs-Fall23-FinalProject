The gordita is in contrast to a [[taco]], which uses a thinner [[tortilla]]. \"Gordita\" means \"little fat one\" in Spanish. The gordita is typically baked on a comal, a small pan similar to a [[tava]].\n\nThe gordita's thick [[tortilla]] is typically split and filled with guisos (soups or stews) or casseroles, like [[chicken]], [[cochinita pibil]], [[nopales]], carne al pastor, etc. These are made mostly for lunch and are accompanied by many different types of [[salsas]]. The most traditional \"gordita\" in the central region of Mexico is filled with \"[[chicharr\u00f3n]] prensado\" (a type of stew made with pork rind and spices) and is called \"gordita de chicharr\u00f3n\".\nIn Durango, Mexico, gorditas are commonly made from wheat [[flour]] (harina de trigo) [[tortillas]] and look more like small [[pita breads]]. The [[dough]] (masa) is identical to that of the [[flour tortilla]]. It is cooked on a griddle (comal) with a hot piece of metal placed on top that resembles a clothes iron. The gordita fills up with steam and a small slit is cut into one side where it can be filled with guisados.\n\nThe best gorditas are made with [[Masa harina|masa harina]], though you can make them with [[Yellow cornmeal|yellow cornmeal]] if you cannot obtain [[Masa harina|masa harina]].\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 250g [[Masa harina|masa harina]] or fine [[Yellow cornmeal|yellow cornmeal]]\n| &#189; level teaspoon of [[Sea Salt|sea salt]]\n| 1 heaped teaspoon of [[Baking powder|baking powder]]\n| 350 ml very hot water\n| [[Yellow cornmeal]] for rolling\n| [[Vegetable oil]] for [[Frying|frying]]\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Add the [[Masa|masa]] and [[Salt|salt]] to a large bowl and make a well in the centre.\n| Mix the [[Baking powder|baking powder]] into the hot water and pour into the centre of the [[Masa|masa]].\n| Using a spoon, fold the [[Masa|masa]] into the water, once it begins to combine, [[Kneading bread|knead]] with your hands until a firm malleable [[Dough|dough]] is produced.\n| Divide the [[Dough|dough]] into 12 balls, dust the work surface with cornmeal and roll each one out to about the size of a fried egg, leaving them quite thick.\n| Heat a large [[Frying pan|frying pan]] and add a few glugs of [[Oil|oil]]\n| Fill the pan with as many [[Gorditas|gorditas]] as will fit and [[Fry|fry]] for 3 minutes a side, turning once.
