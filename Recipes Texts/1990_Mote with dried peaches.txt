It is a non-alcoholic beverage consisting of a sweet liquid syrup made with [[Dried|dried]] [[Peaches|peaches]] (huesillo) and mixed with fresh cooked husked [[Wheat|wheat]] (mote).\n\nThe sweet syrup is made with [[Sugar|sugar]], however can be supplemented with [[Honey|honey]]. When the drink is served without the dried peaches, it is called a descarozados. Both the mote and [[huesillo]] correspond to Mediterranean climates, like that of central Chile.\nThis drink is very popular during summer months and is sold by street vendors on rolling carts or stands. It is also a very popular homemade recipe, for which the ingredients are readily available in supermarkets, small grocery stores and farmers' markets. Bottled, canned or store packaged versions of mote con huesillo are limited and less common.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 12 whole [[Dried|dried]] [[Peaches|peaches]]\n| 150 g [[Sugar]] or molasses / golden syrup\n| [[Cinnamon stick]]\n| 250 g (&frac14; lb.) husked [[Wheat|wheat]]\n\n}}\n\n===[[Mise en place]]===\nThe huesillos, or [[Dried|dried]] [[Peaches|peaches]], are washed and soaked the night prior to preparation in order to rehydrate them.\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Cook the [[Dried|dried]] [[Peaches|peaches]] for thirty minutes in a [[Sugar|sugar]], molasses, or golden syrup and water mixture, with some natural [[Cinnamon sticks|cinnamon sticks]].\n| To give the [[Drink|drink]] its [[Honey|honey]] hue, sugar is heated in a [[Sauce|sauce]] pan in order to caramelise it and bring it to a rich [[Orange|orange]] ruby colour, which is added to the syrup mixture (this step is not necessary if you have used molasses or golden syrup).\n| While the [[huesillos]] are cooking, the mote, or husked [[Wheat|wheat]], is cooked in water until tender. \n| Once the mote are cooked, they are drained and added to the [[huesillos]] and syrup, and left to cool.\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nThis combination is served chilled, in a tall glass with a tall dessert spoon for easy serving.\n\nServe it in a half-a-litre glass previously cold from the [[Fridge|fridge]] and which had been standing upside down on top of a dish with a [[Sugar|sugar]] base.\n\n===Variations===\nSome people have used [[Prunes|prunes]] instead of [[Dried|dried]] [[Peaches|peaches]], but it is definitely not the same!\n\n''This recipe was added by [[User:Mv.valdivia|Maria Veronica]], one of our Chilean visitors.''\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Chilean recipes]]\n[[Category:Latin American recipes]]\n[[Category:Drink and beverage recipes]]\n[[Category:Snacks and light bites]]\n[[Category:Starters]]\n[[Category:Vegan recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes]]\n[[Category:Fruit recipes]]\n[[Category:Boiled or simmered]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#dried #peaches #wheat #motewithdriedpeaches #huesillos #honey #drink #huesillo #chile #fridge #cinnamonstick </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
