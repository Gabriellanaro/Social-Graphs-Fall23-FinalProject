Traditionally, it was a way of using up leftover [[Beef|beef]], but this recipe explains how to make it from scratch.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 900 g lean [[Beef|beef]] in one piece\n| [[Oil]] for [[Searing|searing]]\n| 2 medium [[Onions|onions]], 1 cut into quarters and the other finely [[Diced|diced]]\n| 2 [[Bay leaves|bay leaves]]\n| A large pinch each of [[Sugar|sugar]] and [[Salt|salt]] \n| 600 ml hot water or weak [[Beef stock|beef stock]]\n| 30 ml [[Olive oil|olive oil]]\n| 5 Cloves [[Garlic|garlic]], [[Diced|diced]]\n| 2 large [[Green chillies|green chillies]] or 4 small ones, finely [[Diced|diced]]\n| 60 g [[Fresh ginger|fresh ginger]] root\n| 3 [[Sweet peppers|sweet peppers]], one each of green, yellow and red, finely [[Diced|diced]]\n| A large pinch of [[Ground black pepper|ground black pepper]]\n| A pinch each of [[Cinnamon|cinnamon]], sweet [[Paprika|paprika]] and [[Dried|dried]] [[Oregano|oregano]] or [[Marjoram|marjoram]]\n| 4 ripe [[Tomatoes|tomatoes]], peeled and chopped\n| 2 [[Carrots|carrots]], peeled and cut into thickish [[Julienne|julienne]] strips\n| 1 teaspoon [[Flour|flour]] (optional)\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Heat the [[Searing|searing]] [[Oil|oil]] in a deep pan to a high temperature and briefly seal the [[Beef|beef]] on both sides.\n| Remove the pan from the heat and reduce the temperature to low-medium.\n| Add the quartered [[Onion|onion]], [[Bay leaves|bay leaves]], [[Sugar|sugar]], [[Salt|salt]] and sufficient water to cover the [[Beef|beef]].  The  water must be hot or the beef will become tough.\n| Cover and [[Simmer|simmer]] for about 1&frac12; hours (adding more water if necessary) or until the [[Meat|meat]] is tender.  \n| Remove the [[Meat|meat]] and put in a dish, pour the [[Stock|stock]] into a jug and allow both to cool on one side. \n| Meanwhile, add the remaining [[Oil|oil]] to the same pan and gently [[Fry|fry]] the [[Diced|diced]] [[Onion|onion]], [[Ginger|ginger]], [[Chillies|chillies]] and [[Garlic|garlic]], until the garlic and onion are golden.\n| Add the [[Ground pepper|ground pepper]], [[Cinnamon|cinnamon]], [[Paprika|paprika]] and [[Herbs|herbs]] and allow to [[Fry|fry]] for 30 seconds or so.\n| Add the sweet [[Pepper|peppers]], [[Tomatoes|tomatoes]] and [[Carrots|carrots]] and allow the mixture to thicken.  You can add a little [[Flour|flour]] to help you if necessary.\n| When the [[Meat|meat]] is cool, cut it into thin strips with scissors and add to the [[Vegetables|vegetables]] with the reserved [[Stock|stock]].\n| Heat through and serve.\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nThe simplest way of serving this would be with plain, [[Steamed|steamed]], long-[[Grain|grain]] [[Rice|rice]].\n\n===Variations===\nIf you wish to use leftover [[Beef|beef]], cut up the [[Meat|meat]] as above and just add it to the [[Vegetables|vegetables]] with some strongish [[Beef stock|beef stock]].\n\nYou can add other [[Spices|spices]] such as [[Allspice|allspice]], [[Cumin|cumin]] or [[Coriander|coriander]].  [[Capers]] are also quite popular in Cuban cuisine.\n\n===Chef's notes===\nI use unrolled topside, recommended by our butcher as being less likely to fall apart, but thickish [[Steak|steak]] would also be fine.\n\n[[Jalape\u00f1o chillies]] are the more usual variety for this dish, but fresh ones are not easily obtained in the UK.  I used [[serrano chillies]] but if you want, any sort will be fine so long as you adjust the quantity according to the heat or lack of it of your chosen [[chillies]].  De-seed them if you wish.\n\n{{Template:PeelingGinger}}\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes|Beef stew]]\n[[Category:Chilli pepper recipes|Beef stew]]\n[[Category:Beef recipes|Beef stew]]\n[[Category:Latin American recipes|Beef stew]]\n[[Category:Cuban recipes|Beef stew]]\n[[Category:Spicy recipes|Beef stew]]\n[[Category:Stews and casseroles|Beef stew]]\n[[Category:Stewed, braised or pot roasted]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#diced #beef #tomatoes #paprika #garlic #vegetables #bayleaves #searing #carrots #fry #onion </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
