It is a popular form of fast food in the Arab World, where it is also served as a mezze.\n\nFalafel is usually served in [[pitta bread]], either inside the pita, which acts as a pocket, or wrapped in a flat pita. In many countries falafel is a popular street food or fast food. The falafel balls, whole or crushed, may be topped with salads, pickled vegetables and hot sauce, and drizzled with [[tahini]]-based sauces. Falafel balls may also be eaten alone as a snack or served as part of a mezze. During Ramadan, they are sometimes eaten as part of an iftar, the meal which breaks the daily fast after sunset.\n\nFalafel has been part of the diet of Egyptians and the people of the Arab World (Muslims, Christians and Mizrahi Jews among them) for centuries.\n\n==Falafel recipe==\n\nYou can buy packets of [[Falafel|falafel]] mixture but it's just as easy to make it yourself, and like all self-made meals, you can adjust the flavours to suit your tastes.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| 225 g (8oz) [[Dried|dried]] [[Chickpeas|chickpeas]], soaked overnight in cold water, boiled until soft (about 2 hours) and drained\n| 75 g pitta bread, torn into pieces\n| 75 g fine [[burghul]]\n| 1 small [[onion]], peeled and chopped\n| 1 teaspoon [[Cumin|cumin]] seeds, ground\n| 1 teaspoon [[Coriander|coriander]] seeds, ground\n| 1 - 2 teaspoons [[chilli flakes]] or [[chilli powder]] (or to taste)\n| 1 - 2 [[Garlic|garlic]] cloves, peeled and crushed (or to taste)\n| 1 tablespoon fresh [[coriander]] or [[Parsley|parsley]] leaves and stalks, chopped\n| The juice and [[Zest|zest]] from &frac12; a [[Lemon|lemon]]\n| [[Sea salt]] and freshly ground [[black pepper]] to taste\n| [[Vegetable oil]] for [[Frying|frying]]\n}}\n\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Soak the pitta breads until soft\n| Soak the [[burghul]] for 15 minutes\n| Squeeze as much water out of the [[burghul]] and the [[pitta bread]], you can use a [[jelly bag]] for this\n| In a [[Coffee|coffee]] grinder or [[Mortar and pestle|mortar and pestle]], grind the [[Coriander|coriander]] and [[Cumin|cumin]] seeds.\n| Rinse and drain the [[Chickpeas|chickpeas]] and place in a [[Food processor|food processor]] with the rest of the ingredients \n| Blend until smooth\n| Shape into about 25 balls and refrigerate for 2 hours to allow the flavours to mingle.\n| Heat 5 cm (2\") of [[Oil|oil]] in a frying pan or [[Wok|wok]], or you can use a deep-fat fryer.\n| [[Deep-fry]] in batches for about 4-5 minutes, until [[Browned|browned]]. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper\n}}\n===Serving suggestion===\n\nServe 3 or 4 falafel inside a warm [[pitta bread]], with a drizzle of [[Yoghurt|yogurt]] or [[garlic mayonnaise]] and a few salad leaves.\n===Variations===\nPersonally, I would add 1-2 bulbs (rather than cloves) of [[Garlic|garlic]], but leave out the [[lemon]] [[zest]].\n\nUse 1 large 400 g can of chickpeas, drained instead of dried chickpeas.\n===Chef's tip===\n\nFalafel freeze well.\n\n==See also==\n* '''[[Falafel with cucumber salad and pitta bread]]'''\n{{RecipeLine}}\n{{CategoryLineIngredients}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Garlic recipes]]\n[[Category:Grain and bean recipes]]\n[[Category:Lebanese recipes]]\n[[Category:Middle Eastern recipes]]\n[[Category:North African recipes]]\n[[Category:Starters]]\n[[Category:Snacks and light bites]]\n[[Category:Tapas, mezze and antipasti]]\n[[Category:Vegan recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegetable recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes]]\n[[Category:Ingredients]]\n[[Category:Prepared foods]]\n[[Category:Deep fried]]\n[[Category:Pan fried]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#falafel #coriander #pittabread #burghul #chickpeas #lemon #cumin #garlic #zest #jellybag #frying </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
