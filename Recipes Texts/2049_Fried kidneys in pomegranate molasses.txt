Any excuse to use my [[Pomegranate molasses|pomegranate molasses]].  The original recipe specifies lambs [[Kidneys|kidneys]], I would reduce the number to 4 if you are using [[Beef|beef]] kidneys.\n\nI have kept the original quantities, however for the [[Sake|sake]] of your health, I would reduce the amount of [[salt]] and [[butter]] (or use 50/50 with [[olive oil]]).\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 8 Lambs [[Kidneys|kidneys]]\n| 6 oz [[Butter|butter]] [see note above]\n| 2 tablespoons [[Salt|salt]] [see note above]\n| 4 oz sour [[Pomegranate|pomegranate]] [[Juice|juice]] - Made up from about 1 part [[Pomegranate molasses|pomegranate molasses]] to 3 parts water and mixed well\n| 1 oz [[Garlic]], peeled and crushed\n| &#189; teaspoon [[Spice]] mix [below]\n| Few tablespoons [[Plain flour|plain flour]]\n| Chopped [[Parsley|parsley]] to garnish\n}}\n'''[[Spice|spice]] mix'''\n* Equal quantities, [[Cinnamon|cinnamon]], [[White cumin|white cumin]], [[Chilli powder|chilli powder]] and [[Paprika|paprika]], mixed together and finely [[Ground|ground]].\n\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Cut the [[Kidneys|kidneys]] in half lengthwise, trim and remove the skins.\n| Flatten them under a cleaver or a heavy pan, [cut into small pieces if desired]\n| Heat the [[Butter|butter]] and [[Fry|fry]] the [[Kidneys|kidneys]] on both sides until [[Browned|browned]].\n| Remove the [[Kidneys|kidneys]] and keep warm.\n| Fry the garlic until it starts to colour.\n| Add the [[Spice|spice]] mixture and [[Salt|salt]] to the [[Flour|flour]] and mix into what remains of the [[Butter|butter]].\n| Stir until it just begins to [[Brown|brown]] then add the [[Pomegranate|pomegranate]] [[Juice|juice]], allow to [[Boil|boil]], return the [[Kidneys|kidneys]] and cook for a few minutes in the [[Sauce|sauce]].\n| Serve hot garnished with [[parsley]].\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nThe original recipe suggests [[Fried|fried]] or pur\u00e9ed [[Potatoes|potatoes]].  I think it would go nicely with [[Brown|brown]] toast as a [[Starter|starter]].\n===Chef's note===\nWell this was an interesting dish.  I think when I make it again I will brown the kidneys first over a very high heat, in a little oil, and then continue with the sauce.  It was fine with half the butter and mush less salt.\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes|Kidneys]]\n[[Category:Beef recipes|Kidneys]]\n[[Category:Garlic recipes|Kidneys]]\n[[Category:Historic recipes|Kidneys]]\n[[Category:Lamb recipes|Kidneys]]\n[[Category:Lebanese recipes]]\n[[Category:Middle Eastern recipes|Kidneys]]\n[[Category:North African recipes|Kidneys]]\n[[Category:Starters|Kidneys]]\n[[Category:Pan fried]]\n[[Category:Boiled or simmered]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#kidneys #butter #spice #friedkidneysinpomegranatemolasses #pomegranate #parsley #pomegranatemolasses #starter #juice #boil #unusualrecipes </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
