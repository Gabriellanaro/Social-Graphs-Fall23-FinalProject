The special addition to this recipe are added carrots and mustard seeds.\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 300g (10 oz) [[Potatoes|potatoes]], unpeeled (Nadine - Saxon - Wilja - Desiree - King Edward) \n| 10 [[savoy cabbage]] leaves\n| 1 medium carrot\n| 2 tablespoons [[Rapeseed oil]]\n| Pinch of [[freshly ground black pepper]]\n| 1 tablespoon of black mustard seeds\n| 1 [[Onion|onion]], peeled and chopped\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| [[Boil]] the [[Potatoes|potatoes]] in their skins, in lightly [[Salted|salted]] water for 25 minutes, drain, rub the skins off and chop into cubes\n| Using a [[Potato ricer|potato ricer]] or [[Mash|mash]]er, mash the [[Potatoes|potatoes]], season to taste with [[Salt|salt]] and [[Pepper|pepper]]\n| Remove the centre stems of the cabbage leaves and discard. Roll up the cabbage leaves and chop finely.\n| If you have a [[julienne peeler]], use that to turn your carrot into julienne strips. If not then grate roughly with a [[cheese grater]]\n| Add the cabbage and carrot to a small pan of boiling water. Bring the pan back to the boil and boil for 3 minutes.\n| At this stage, if you want to keep the bright green colour, plunge the cooked cabbage into cold water until you're ready to cook the squeak.\n| Heat 2 tablespoons of [[Oil|oil]] in a [[Frying pan|frying pan]] or [[wok]] and add a good pinch of black pepper\n| Gently fry the [[onions]] for 4 minutes\n| Leaving as much [[Oil|oil]] in the pan as you can, remove the [[Onions|onions]] and mix in with the [[Potato|potato]], [[carrot]] and [[Cabbage|cabbage]] mixture and sprinkle with [[mustard seeds]]\n| Add a little more oil to the onion frying pan. Spread the mixture evenly over the pan and turn up the heat. Fry for about 6 minutes, turning and mixing every minute so you get a nice crispy finish.\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\n\nServe hot. If presentation is important, at the serving stage, use [[egg rings]] to mould the squeak into neat rounds - it;s much easier than trying to cook them in [[egg rings]] or [[silicone rings]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[Bubble and squeak]]\n*[[Squash, bubble and squeak|Squash, bubble and squeak recipe]]\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Accompaniments]]\n[[Category:Historic recipes]]\n[[Category:Potato recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegetable recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Student recipes]]\n[[Category:Pan fried]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#potatoes #bubbleandcarrotsqueak #onions #eggrings #bubbleandsqueak #panfried #carrot #savoycabbage #rapeseedoil #juliennepeeler #salted </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
