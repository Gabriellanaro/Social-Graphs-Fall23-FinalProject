The chief ingredients are [[Potato|potato]] and [[Cabbage|cabbage]], but [[Carrots|carrots]], [[Peas|peas]], [[Brussels sprouts]], and other [[Vegetables|vegetables]] can be added.\n\nThe name probably comes from the sound the [[cabbage]] makes whilst this dish is being [[fried]].\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 450 g (1 lb) [[Potatoes|potatoes]], unpeeled (Nadine - Saxon - Wilja - Desiree - King Edward) \n| [[Sea Salt|sea salt]] and [[Freshly ground black pepper|freshly ground black pepper]]\n| 70 g (2.5 oz) [[Butter|butter]]\n| 250 g (8 oz) [[Cabbage|cabbage]], [[Shredded|shredded]]\n| 3 tablespoons water\n| 3-4 tablespoons [[Olive oil|olive oil]]\n| 1 [[Onion|onion]], chopped\n| 2 [[Spring onions|spring onions]], chopped (optional)\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| [[Boil]] the [[Potatoes|potatoes]] in their skins, in lightly [[Salted|salted]] water for 25 minutes, drain, rub the skins off and chop into cubes\n| Using a [[Potato ricer|potato ricer]] or [[Mash|mash]]er, mash the [[Potatoes|potatoes]] with 55 g (2 oz) of the [[Butter|butter]], season to taste with [[Salt|salt]] and [[Pepper|pepper]]\n| Meanwhile, place the [[Cabbage|cabbage]], 3 tablespoons water and the remaining 15 g (1/2 oz) [[Butter|butter]] in a large heavy based pan, cover and gently cook for 10 minutes, or until tender\n| Mix the [[Mashed potato|mashed potato]] and [[Cabbage|cabbage]]\n| Heat half the [[Oil|oil]] in a [[Frying pan|frying pan]] and add the [[Onion|onion]] and [[Fry|fry]] gently until softened, about 4 minutes\n| Leaving as much [[Oil|oil]] in the pan as you can, remove the [[Onions|onions]] and mix in with the [[Potato|potato]] and [[Cabbage|cabbage]] mixture\n| If using [[Spring onions|spring onions]], mix them into the [[Potatoes|potatoes]] now\n| Make flat patties with the [[Potato|potato]] mix and [[Fry|fry]] for 15 minutes on one side\n| Add the remaining [[Oil|oil]], flip the patties over and [[Fry|fry]] for a further 10 minutes\n}}\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Bubble and squeak frying.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Bubble and scrape, frying\nImage:Bubble and scrape.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Mashed and mixed, ready to fry\n</gallery>\n\n===Serving suggestions===\n\nServe hot\n\n===Chef's note===\n\nYou can fry these as separate 'patties' or as pictured, as one large ''tortilla''.  If you're careful, you can flip it to cook both sides, I prefer just to stir it up now and then to ensure that you get lots of the lovely crispy caramelised surfaces.\n\n===Variations===\n\nUse left over [[Vegetables|vegetables]] instead of cooking afresh.\n\nUse [[Squash mash]] for the potatoes.\n\n==See also==\n\n[[Squash, bubble and squeak|Squash, bubble and squeak recipe]]\n[[Bubble and carrot squeak]]\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Accompaniments]]\n[[Category:Historic recipes]]\n[[Category:Potato recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegetable recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Student recipes]]\n[[Category:Pan fried]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#bubbleandsqueak #cabbage #potatoes #butter #potato #fry #vegetables #onion #fried #springonions #potatoricer </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
