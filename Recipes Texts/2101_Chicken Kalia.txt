I even increased some of the quantities, see Chef's notes below.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 1 x 1kg [[Chicken|chicken]], cut into serving pieces; [[Jointing a chicken|''see here'']]\n| 250ml [[Yoghurt|yogurt]]\n| 2 [[Cinnamon sticks|cinnamon sticks]] (abut 3cm long)\n| 3 [[Split|split]] [[Cardamoms|cardamoms]]\n| 4 [[Cloves|cloves]]\n| 2 tablespoons powdered [[Cumin|cumin]]\n| 2 [[Green chillies|green chillies]], slit\n| pinch of [[Turmeric|turmeric]]\n| 1 teaspoon mixed [[Grated|grated]] [[Ginger|ginger]] and [[Garlic|garlic]]\n| 5 tablespoons of chopped [[Coriander leaves|coriander leaves]]\n| [[Salt|salt]] and [[Black pepper|black pepper]], to taste\n| 2 [[Onions|onions]], finely sliced\n| 120ml mixed [[Oil|oil]] and [[Ghee|ghee]]\n| pinch of [[Saffron|saffron]]\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| 1. Add the [[Chicken|chicken]] to deep cooking pan and mix-in all the ingredients apart from the [[Onions|onions]], [[Ghee|ghee]] and [[Oil|oil]] mixture and [[Saffron|saffron]]. [[Marinate]] the chicken for 1 hour of more.\n| 2. [[Fry]] the [[Onions|onions]] in the [[Ghee|ghee]]/[[Oil|oil]] mix until golden [[Brown|brown]] and crisp. Remove and set aside then pour the remaining oil into the pan with the [[Chicken|chicken]]. \n| 3. Soak the [[Saffron|saffron]] in half a cup of hot water and allow to infuse before pouring onto the [[Chicken|chicken]]. \n| 4. Mix well, cover and cook over a low heat for about 40 minutes, or until the [[Chicken|chicken]] is done. Add the [[Fried|fried]] [[Onion|onion]], cook for a further 3 minutes and serve with [[Rice|rice]].\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nThis dish is best served with plain [[White rice|white rice]] or [[cumin rice]] or [[Parathas|parathas]].\n===Chef's notes===\nThis was one of the best 'curries' I have tasted!  Creamy and spicy but not too hot.  I served it with [[chapatis]] and baby new potatoes. ([[Potatoes#Pictures_of_varieties_of_potatoes|pink fir apple]]) as we had just dug them that day and wanted to taste them!\n\nFor authenticity, I will leave the original recipe as it was given to Cookipedia, however, I meddled a little so I've noted the changes I made so I can re create my version again as this will be made again and again.\n* I left the slashed chicken pieces refrigerating in the [[marinade]] for 5 hours before cooking\n* 3 tablespoons of lime juice\n* Instead of [[yogurt]] I used [[cr\u00e8me fraiche]] hoping it would not split as yogurt sometimes does.  It split!\n* 6 fat [[Garlic|garlic]] cloves, peeled and crushed\n* [[Home made lazy ginger]], about 50% by volume of the [[Garlic|garlic]], roughly [[grated]]\n* 10 [[peppercorns]], powdered\n* 3 [[Indian green chillies]], split\n* 4 [[black cardamom pods]], whole\n* 1/2 cup chicken stock\n* The remaining ingredients were unchanged from the recipe above\n* Cooked in the oven for about an hour at 200\u00b0 C (400\u00b0 F - gas 6)\n==See also==\n* {{See also - Jointing a chicken}}\n{{Template:PeelingGinger}}\n\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Mauritian recipes]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:Poultry recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Spicy recipes]]\n[[Category:Favourite recipes]]\n[[Category:Boiled or simmered]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#chicken #chickenkalia #garlic #ghee #onions #saffron #grated #parathas #marinate #chapatis #boiledorsimmered </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
