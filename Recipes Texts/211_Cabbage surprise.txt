In our village we are fortunate to have a number of stalls selling locally grown fruit and vegetables, only a 5 minute cycle ride away.\n\nAlthough, as the name might imply, it started as a bit of a joke, but it was so good, I'm committing it to a recipe and making it again.\n\nI appreciate most people probably won't have exactly the same powdered flavourings that we have available from our fairly large [[Stock|stock]] of [[Taste Sensation]] products, but with a little ingenuity  you can do pretty well.  I've listed a few alternative suggestions in the variations section.\n\nI've also used a [[Food processor|food processor]], which makes life easier, but you can do just as well with a knife - that helps to kill time too!\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| 1 [[Leek|leek]], trimmed, cleaned and thinly sliced\n| 1 small [[Cabbage|cabbage]] discard the old leaves and core and slice the remaining cabbage into slices\n| 1 large [[Potato|potato]], peeled and thinly sliced\n| 250g [[Pork|pork]] [[Sausage meat|sausage meat]]\n| 50g [[Taste Sensation Smokey BBQ & Apple sauce Mix]] mixed into 350ml warm water\n| 1 [[Chicken stock|chicken stock]] cube, mixed into 150 ml warm water\n| 2 tablespoons [[Olive oil|olive oil]]\n| Pinch of [[Sea Salt|sea salt]]\n}}\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n\n* Preheat your [[Oven|oven]] to 200\u00b0 C (400\u00b0 F - gas 6), [fan oven 180\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]\n\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| Rinse and drain the [[Potato|potato]] slices in fresh cold water a few times to remove any excess [[Starch|starch]] and [[Dry|dry]] in a [[Salad spinner|salad spinner]] of [[Tea towel|tea towel]]\n| [[Brush]] a little [[Olive oil|olive oil]] around an [[Iron|iron]] or [[Glass|glass]] based [[Oven-proof casserole dish|oven-proof casserole dish]]\n| Distribute the [[Cabbage|cabbage]] slices over the base of the dish\n| cover with about half of the sliced [[Leeks|leeks]]\n| Add a layer of [[Potatoes|potatoes]] and cover those with more [[Leeks|leeks]]\n| Pour the [[Chicken stock|chicken stock]] over this and press down well\n| Form the [[Sausage meat|sausage meat]] into small [[Meatballs|meatballs]] and place those on the [[Leeks|leeks]]\n| Cover with the remaining [[Potato|potato]] slices, ensuring that all the [[Meatballs|meatballs]] are covered with the slices of potato, so the [[Meat|meat]] cannot burn or [[Dry|dry]] out\n| Pour the [[Taste Sensation Smokey BBQ & Apple sauce Mix]] all over this - it makes a really nice finish once the [[Potatoes|potatoes]] crisp up se ensure everything is covered\n| [[Spray]] a little [[Olive oil|olive oil]] over the [[Potatoes|potatoes]] to [[Help|help]] them crisp up\n| [[Bake]] for 1 hour 30 minutes at 200\u00b0 C - check every 30 minutes and cover with a metal [[Baking tray|baking tray]] if it looks as though it is starting to burn.\n| Voila - [[Cabbage]] surprise!\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nThis was superb on its own.\n===Variations===\nPop some peeled [[Apple|apple]] slices amongst the [[Cabbage|cabbage]] and sprinkle with some [[Sugar|sugar]] and [[Smoked paprika|smoked paprika]].\n\nMake up the [[Sauce|sauce]] mix with 3 tablespoons of bottled [[Barbecue sauce|barbecue sauce]] and a few tablespoons of [[Tomato sauce|tomato sauce]]\n\nMake the [[Sauce|sauce]] with a teaspoon of [[Chilli powder|chilli powder]], a teaspoon of [[Smoked paprika|smoked paprika]],a tablespoon of [[Paprika powder|paprika powder]] and two teaspoons of [[Honey|honey]]\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:Pork recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegetable recipes]]\n[[Category:Taste Sensation recipes]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n[[Category:Recipes from other sites]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:12032020'>#cabbage #leeks #potato #oliveoil #potatoes #smokedpaprika #dry #chickenstock #sauce #meatballs #cabbagesurprise</code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
