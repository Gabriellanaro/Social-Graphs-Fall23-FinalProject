The Panasonic SD 253 and similar models have a 45 minute pizza dough setting that is perfect for tortilla dough.\n| Rest for at least 1 hour then shape into 10 equal sized balls.\n| Using a [[tortilla press]] or [[rolling pin]], place a ball of dough between two non-stick sheets ([[Bake-O-Glide]]or similar) and press into shape\n| Heat a frying pan to a medium high temperature (but with no oil).\n| Cook each tortilla on one side for 15 seconds.\n| Turn and cook for 45 seconds.\n| Turn again and cook for a further 15 seconds.\n| They should have brown speckles.\n}}\n===Serving suggestion===\n\nCan be eaten as they are, fried, wrapped around [[beans]], [[salad]], [[chicken]], [[cheese]] etc.\n\nUse as suggested in your recipe\n*Make [[Cheese pupusas]] or [[Dobladas]] with your homemade [[maize tortillas]]\n===Variations===\n\nAdd 1-2 teaspoons [[chilli powder]] and/or 2-3 teaspoons [[garlic powder]] to the mixture.\n\n===Chef's note===\n\nIf you don't have a [[tortilla press]], use 2 chopping boards or just two sheets of wood as a substitute.  Place ball of [[dough]] between two non-stick surfaces such as small squares of [[Bake-O-Glide]] and stand on them!\n\n===Suppliers===\n\nSee the [[Tortilla Press]] page for UK suppliers.\n\n{{Tortillas-See also}}\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes|Tortilla]]\n[[Category:Accompaniments|Tortilla]]\n[[Category:Mexican recipes]]\n[[Category:Latin American recipes|Tortilla]]\n[[Category:Bread and baking|Tortilla]]\n[[Category:Grain and bean recipes|Tortilla]]\n[[Category:Starters|Tortilla]]\n[[Category:Snacks and light bites|Tortilla]]\n[[Category:Tex-Mex recipes|Tortilla]]\n[[Category:North American recipes|Tortilla]]\n[[Category:Pan fried]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#tortillapress #masaharina #dough #corntortillarecipe #dobladas #salad #rollingpin #tortillas #garlicpowder #chicken #beans </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
