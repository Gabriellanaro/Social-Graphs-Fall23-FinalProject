Very impressed with the [[Taste Sensation]] [[Jalapeno and Lime Seasoning]], fabulous. It's good enough to eat with a spoon - reminder to self: try this on chicken pieces!\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| 200 g shelled [[Almonds|almonds]]\n| 1 tablespoon [[Ghee|ghee]], [[Butter|butter]] or [[Olive oil|olive oil]]\n| 4 [[Cloves garlic, peeled and crushed|cloves garlic, peeled and crushed]]\n| 1 tablespoon [[Muscovado sugar|muscovado sugar]]\n| &#189; teaspoon pink [[Sea Salt|sea salt]], optional\n}}\n\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| Heat the [[Ghee|ghee]] or [[Butter|butter]] in a [[Wok|wok]], do not let it burn\n| Add the [[Garlic|garlic]] and [[Saute|saute]] for a minute or so.  As soon as the garlic starts to colour, take off the heat and add the [[Almonds|almonds]] - toss them to cover evenly\n| Add the [[Sugar|sugar]] and reheat so it melts and coats the [[Nuts|nuts]]\n| Shake the seasoning and [[Salt|salt]] over  and mix in really well\n}}\n===Recipe source===\n\n* Inspired by [[Taste Sensation]] seasoning mixes!\n===Chef's notes===\nAs raw products cooked with fresh [[Garlic|garlic]] don't keep too well and have the propensity to harbour nasty bacteria it's probably best to keep these in the [[Refrigerator|refrigerator]] and use them within a week or so.\n\nThey are so good, I don't suppose they will be around for long.\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Recipes from other sites]]\n[[Category:Mexican recipes]]\n[[Category:Snacks and light bites]]\n[[Category:Spicy recipes]]\n[[Category:Tapas, mezze and antipasti]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes]]\n[[Category:Chilli pepper recipes]]\n[[Category:Garlic recipes]]\n[[Category:Pan fried]]\n[[Category:Taste Sensation recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#garlic #almonds #tastesensation #ghee #butter #jalapenoandlimespicedalmonds #refrigerator #muscovadosugar #wok #tastesensationrecipes #nuts </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
