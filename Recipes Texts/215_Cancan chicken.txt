This recipe proves this, conclusively.  It's also ideal if you don't happen to be a [[Beer|beer]] drinker.  All you need is a clean empty tin-can label removed and well washed - the dishwasher is ideal. Use a ring-pull type can as there are less sharp edges to worry about.  I used a cat-food tin!\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| 2 kg whole [[Chicken|chicken]] (4 lb)\n| 1 [[Lemon]], quartered\n| 1 [[Lime]], half quartered, the remainder sliced for a garnish\n| 1 small bulb of [[Garlic crushed|garlic crushed]]\n| 2 tablespoons [[Butter|butter]] at room temperature\n| A huge handful of [[Herbs|herbs]] of your choice\n| 1 teaspoon of [[Black peppercorns|black peppercorns]], roughly crushed in a [[Mortar and pestle|mortar and pestle]]\n| [[Table salt]]\n| 1 teaspoon of [[Szechuan peppercorns|Szechuan peppercorns]], roughly crushed in a [[Mortar and pestle|mortar and pestle]]\n\n}}\n\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n\n* Preheat the [[Oven|oven]] to 200\u00b0 C (400\u00b0 F - gas 6), [fan oven 180\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Tin-can chicken ready to roast.jpg|Tin-foil hat, ready to roast\nImage:Lemon, lime, herbs and a butter-rub.jpg|The clean empty can, citrus, herbs, water and a the herb-butter rub\nImage:Can-can chicken_ingredients.jpg|Can-can chicken, the ingredients\n</gallery>\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| This is best made with a [[Grillpro Stainless Steel Chicken Roaster]] - it can be done without (see here).  Just be careful that it does not fall over\n| Add the crushed [[Peppercorns|peppercorns]] and [[Garlic|garlic]] to the warmed [[Butter|butter]], mix well and season with &#188; teaspoons of [[Salt|salt]]\n| Pack the clean empty tin can with the [[Herbs|herbs]], all of the quartered [[Lemons|lemons]] and half the [[Lime|lime]]\n| Half fill with cold water\n| Remove the [[Parsons nose|parsons nose]], if you remember!\n| Carefully sit the [[Chicken|chicken]] on the tin can\n| From the top of the [[Chicken|chicken]], push your fingers between the skin and the breasts to separate them and create pockets.  Pack most of the [[Herb|herb]] [[Butter|butter]] between the skin and the breast mat.  This gives it wonderful flavour and keeps it moist.\n| Rub the remaining [[Herb|herb]] [[Butter|butter]] over the skin and season with a little [[Table salt|table salt]].\n| Make a [[Tin-foil|tin-foil]] 'hat' to protect the bird from burning as it's likely to be quite close to the top of the [[Oven|oven]].\n| [[Roast]] for 1 hour 30 minutes, removing the [[Foil|foil]] for the final 30 minutes.\n| Leave to [[Rest for|rest for]] 15 minutes before serving - I usually turn the [[Oven|oven]] off and leave the door open.\n| Discard the can and its contents, carve and serve.\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe the [https://www.cookipedia.co.uk/calories/chicken/bq/11#jump chicken] with [[Roast potatoes|roast potatoes]], [[Green vegetables|green vegetables]], gravy and slices of [[Lime|lime]].\n===Chef' notes===\nThis was fantastic - Crisp, juicy and loads of flavour.  It also saves you wasting a can of beer!\n===Variations===\nUse  whatever [[Fresh herbs|fresh herbs]] you can lay your hands on.  I used [[Bay leaves|bay leaves]], a huge bunch of [[Sage|sage]], [[Chives|chives]], [[Cutting celery|cutting celery]] and a little [[Thyme|thyme]] - it's surprising how much you can pack into a tin with the [[Lemons|lemons]].\n\nIf you don't have [[Szechuan peppercorns]] use a little more [[black peppercorns]] - I just find they make an interesting change.\n{{Template:Beercan chicken - See also}}\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:North American recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Fruit recipes]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:Poultry recipes]]\n[[Category:Favourite recipes]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#cancanchicken #butter #chicken #lime #blackpeppercorns #szechuanpeppercorns #mortarandpestle #beer #tablesalt #herb #herbs </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
