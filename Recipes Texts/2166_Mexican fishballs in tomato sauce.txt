Most [[:Category:Tex-Mex ingredients (supplier)|Mexican ingredient suppliers]] stock it.\n\nMake this with any [[white fish]], [[Basa|basa]] would be my choice as a flavoursome, economical and sustainable fish. Most supermarkets now stock it.\n\n'''fishballs'''\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 250g [[Basa|basa]] fillets, roughly chopped\n| 1 [[Spring onion|spring onion]], roughly chopped\n| About 200 ml of dried breadcrumbs or 2 slices of [[White bread|white bread]], finely chopped\n| 1 raw [[egg]]\n| A big handful of chopped [[Parsley|parsley]]\n| [[Sea Salt|sea salt]] and [[Freshly ground black pepper|freshly ground black pepper]]\n}}\n'''to coat'''\n{{RecipeIngredientsNB\n| 50g [[Masa harina]]\n}}\n'''for [[Frying|frying]]'''\n{{RecipeIngredientsNB\n| 1 tablespoon of butter, 2 tablespoons of [[Olive oil]]\n}}\n''' serve and garnish with'''\n{{RecipeIngredientsNB\n| [[Tabasco sauce]] or [[Louisiana Hot Pepper Sauce|Louisiana hot pepper sauce]]\n| 1 Sliced [[Roasted red peppers|roasted red peppers]]\n| 150 ml [[Sofrito]] or [[Tomato sauce for pizza]]\n| 1 Finely chopped [[Hard-boiled eggs|hard-boiled egg]]\n| 10 [[Olives]]\n| 1 tablespoon freshly chopped [[Parsley|parsley]]\n}}\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>>\nImage:Mexican fishballs frying.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Frying the fishballs\nImage:Mexican fishballs in tomato sauce ingredients.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The original ingredients - the recipe has since been slightly modified\n</gallery>\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Add all of the fishball ingredients into a [[Food processor|food processor]] with a metal blade and blitz to a rough paste.\n| Roll into small balls and leave to chill in the [[Fridge|fridge]] for an hour or so\n| Add a few tablespoons of [[Masa harina|masa harina]] to a large plate, only a little is needed so don't waste it as I did!\n| Roll the balls in [[Masa harina|masa harina]] to coat.\n| Heat the butter and oil in a large frying pan and shallow [[Fry|fry]] until browned and crispy on the outside\n| Serve with [[Tomato sauce|tomato sauce]] and the garnishes of your choice.\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nFor two people this was served with [[Mild Mexican passata]], a portion of pasta for one (100g [[dried pasta]] and a chopped boiled egg.  A very unique and very nice recipe!\n===Variations===\nIf you can get then, fresh [[Poblano chillies|poblano chillies]], [[Roasted|roasted]] and sliced would go well with this as they fairly mild.\n\nI have added a handful of finely chopped [[dried shrimp]] to the mixture.  Not authentic, but adds a nice fishy touch to fishcakes and similar recipes.\n\nWhen I made this I tinkered with the tomato sauce and came up with a separate recipe (if you can call it a recipe), [[Mild Mexican passata]].  It went really well with the fishballs as it had a slightly bitter, chocolatey note.\n===Chef's notes===\nIf you can't get [[Masa harina|masa harina]], coarsely [[Ground|ground]] [[Yellow cornmeal|yellow cornmeal]] would be ok, but it would not have the same distinct flavour.\n\nWhen I made this, the paste was far too wet, so I added another handful of dried breadcrumbs, a little masa, remixed it and set it in a sieve for an hour to drain a little excess liquid.  The result was still quite liquid, but the end result was excellent.  \n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Mexican recipes]]\n[[Category:Tex-Mex recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Snacks and light bites]]\n[[Category:Tapas, mezze and antipasti]]\n[[Category:Fish recipes]]\n[[Category:Freshwater fish recipes]]\n[[Category:Sea fish recipes]]\n[[Category:Favourite recipes]]\n[[Category:Pan fried]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#masaharina #mexicanfishballsintomatosauce #mildmexicanpassata #basa #parsley #whitebread #tabascosauce #egg #fry #whitefish #oliveoil </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
