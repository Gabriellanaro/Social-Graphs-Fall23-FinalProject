I bought some from [[Amazon]] and was so impressed, I arranged for them to send me more samples to try.\n[[Image:Taste Sensation Mexican Seasoning with pork.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The basic ingredients for the Mexican Pulled Pork]]\nAs this is an experiment I had 1.4kg of [[pork shoulder]] and got the butcher to cut it into three slices.  This is what I did with the second slice.\n\nWhile I could use the [[Taste Sensation Mexican seasoning]] alone, I like to make my recipes my own.  For this I added half an [[Orange|orange]], sliced; some chopped [[Onion|onion]], muscavado [[Sugar|sugar]] and some [[White wine|white wine]].\n\nI hope Adrienne and Martin enjoy it as much as we did!\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| 500g [[Pork shoulder|pork shoulder]]\n| 2 tablespoons [[Taste Sensation Mexican seasoning]]\n| 1 large [[Red onion|red onion]], chopped\n| Half a large [[Orange|orange]], sliced with the rind left on\n| 300 ml [[White wine|white wine]]\n| 1 tablespoon [[Muscovado sugar|muscovado sugar]]\n}}\n\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| Remove any string and excess [[Fat|fat]] or rind from the [[Pork|pork]]\n| Coat both sides of the [[Pork|pork]] with the Taste Sensation [[Mexican]] seasoning\n| Line the [[Slow Cooker|slow cooker]] with the chopped [[Onions|onions]] and half of the [[Orange|orange]] slices\n| Lay the [[Pork|pork]] on to and cover with the remaining [[Orange|orange]] slices\n| Pour the [[White wine|white wine]] into the base of the [[Slow Cooker|slow cooker]]\n| Slow cook on medium for eight hours or so\n| Check halfway through to ensure it is not [[Drying|drying]] out and add a little extra liquid if needed.\n| Remove the rind and drain and excess [[Fat|fat]] with a [[Paper towel|paper towel]]\n| Shred the [[Pork|pork]] into the [[Gravy|gravy]] and serve!\n}}\n\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Recipes from other sites]]\n[[Category:Mexican recipes]]\n[[Category:Tex-Mex recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Spicy recipes]]\n[[Category:Pork recipes]]\n[[Category:Slow cooker recipes]]\n[[Category:Slow cooked]]\n[[Category:Taste Sensation recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#orange #pork #whitewine #mexicanpulledpork #porkshoulder #slowcooker #fat #tastesensationrecipes #muscovadosugar #gravy #redonion </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
