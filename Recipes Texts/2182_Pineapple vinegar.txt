In the meantime, I will do more research, try again, and document the results.  If you have better luck or any ideas, do please update the [[Talk:Pineapple_vinegar|comments page]].'''\n\n[[Mexican]] recipes often call for [[Pineapple|pineapple]] [[Vinegar|vinegar]], and now you can make your own with this simple recipe.  A little like sour [[Dough|dough]], once you have your ''mother or starter'', you can continue making more batches with just water and [[Sugar|sugar]].  The process can take up to 8 weeks or more, so don't expect instant results.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| The peelings from half of a fresh, washed, [[pineapple]]\n| Only the peelings are needed for this recipe, so use the good parts of the peeled and cored [[pineapple]] in [[:Special:Whatlinkshere/Pineapple|one of these recipes!]]\n| 4 heaped tablespoons raw [[Sugar|sugar]] ([[Demerara|demerara]], [[Muscovado|muscovado]], [[Jaggery|jaggery]] etc)\n| 1.5 [[Litres|litres]] water\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Mix the peelings, sugar and water together in a sterilised container and drape with a [[cheesecloth]]\n| Leave in a sunny warm place to ferment. In the UK, a warm conservatory is excellent for this\n| It should start fermenting after 3 days and become acidic\n| It will begin cloudy but should clear and gradually turn a dark amber - this may take 3 weeks or more\n| In a further 3 weeks, the ''mother or starter'' (a white disc of mould) should form - once this forms and is quite solid, the vinegar can be strained and bottled.\n| The ''mother/starter'' can be placed in more water and sugar without the need for more [[pineapple]] to create more vinegar.\n| It may be possible to freeze the ''mother'' for later use - watch this space to see if this worked for me!\n}}\n===Servings===\nServings: 140 - Makes about 1.4 [[Litres|litres]] of [[Pineapple|pineapple]] [[Vinegar|vinegar]]\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Accompaniments]]\n[[Category:Cookery cheats]]\n[[Category:Dips and sauces]]\n[[Category:Pickles and preserves]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes]]\n[[Category:Mexican recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegan recipes]]\n[[Category:Pickled]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#pineapple #pineapplevinegar #litres #vinegar #demerara #cheesecloth #dough #pickled #mexican #muscovado #jaggery </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
