Tender and juicy with a hint of [[Spice|spice]] and [[Herbs|herbs]].  I actually cooked this for another recipe, [[Cheatin' pork enchiladas]] as I needed pre cooked [[Tenderloin|tenderloin]].  This would be fabulous cooked as it is but if you are going to use it in another recipe, try to avoid overcooking the pork in the second recipe or you will lose the benefit of cooking [[Sous vide|sous vide]].\n[[Image:Sous vide TexMex pork tenderloin fillet vac sealed.jpg|300px|thumb|right|Vacuum sealed, ready to cook for 9 hours]]\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| 1 [[Pork tenderloin fillet|pork tenderloin fillet]] (about 700g)\n| 2 bunches of [[Sage leaves|sage leaves]]\n| &#189; small [[Onion|onion]], peeled and sliced\n| 1 stick of celery, cut into moons\n| 1 tablespoon of [[Old India Taco Seasoning]] or a similar [[Spice|spice]] [[Blend|blend]]\n}}\n\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n| If you have a [[Swiss steak|meat tenderiser]] with metal blades, stamp the tenderloin all over, on both sides.\n| Cut the [[Pork fillet|pork fillet]] into 2 pieces so it will fit into a large vacuum bag together with the [[Onion|onion]] a [[Herbs|herbs]].\n| Seal the bag at one end and add the [[Pork tenderloin|pork tenderloin]], [[Onion|onion]], [[Herbs|herbs]] and [[Spices|spices]].\n| Hold the bag closed and shake well to mix.\n| Wipe the edge to be sealed with a [[Paper towel|paper towel]] to ensure it seals properly.\n| [[Vacuum seal]] the bag.  I like to seal twice at both ends, but that's just the pessimist in me!\n| Cook [[Sous vide|sous vide]] at 59\u00b0C (''138.2\u00b0F'') for up to 9 hours or at least a minimum of 3 hours.\n| Once cooked, discard the [[Onions|onions]] and [[Herbs|herbs]] and any juices.\n| If you want to [[Brown|brown]] the outside, cook in a hot pan with a little [[Butter|butter]] for a few minutes, adding an extra blast of a [[Blowtorch|blowtorch]] if you have one.\n| Slice and serve!\n}}\n===Chef's notes===\nIf you are using [[Old India Taco Seasoning]], don't add any [[Salt|salt]] or [[Pepper|pepper]] as this mix is pretty salts already.  However, without Old [[India]] [[Taco seasoning|taco seasoning]], this would be delicious with just a grind of pepper and a pinch of salt added before sealing the bag.\n{{SousVideSeeAlso}}\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Mexican recipes]]\n[[Category:Tex-Mex recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Spicy recipes]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:Pork recipes]]\n[[Category:Sous vide recipes]]\n[[Category:Sous vide cooking]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#herbs #onion #spice #porktenderloin #sousvide #porkfillet #porktenderloinfillet #blowtorch #tacoseasoning #sousvidetexmexporktenderloinfillet #blend </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
