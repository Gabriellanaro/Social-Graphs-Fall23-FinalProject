If you don't have the Old [[India]] [[Taco seasoning|taco seasoning]] you could use homemade [[Tex-Mex seasoning]], a different [[Taco|taco]] seasoning or your own [[Blend|blend]] of spices.  This was so good, we're having again tonight!\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| 125g packet of thinly sliced [[Smoked salmon|smoked salmon]]\n| 1 beaten [[Egg|egg]]\n| 5 tablespoons [[Breadcrumbs|breadcrumbs]]\n| 2 tablespoons [[Old India Taco Seasoning]]\n| 3 tablespoons [[Masa Harina|masa harina]]\n}}\n\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| Separate the [[Smoked salmon|smoked salmon]] sheets and cut them smaller if they are very large.\n| Add the [[Old India Taco Seasoning]] to the [[Breadcrumbs|breadcrumbs]] and mix well.  Tip this mix onto a large plate.\n| Add the [[Masa Harina|masa harina]] to one plate and the beaten [[Egg|egg]] to another.\n| Put 3 tablespoons of [[Olive oil|olive oil]] into a large pan and heat gently.\n| Dredge each [[Salmon|salmon]] sheet in [[Masa Harina|masa harina]] (or [[Plain flour|plain flour]]), [[Dip|dip]] it in the beaten [[Egg|egg]] to coat both sides then dredge it through the [[Breadcrumb|breadcrumb]] mix, patting it down to ensure a good covering.\n| Pop the coated [[Salmon|salmon]] into the pan and cook for 2 minutes a side, turning once.  You may need to do this in batches rather than crowding the pan.\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe with a selection of [[Salads|salads]].\n===Chef's notes===\nIf you are using [[Old India Taco Seasoning]], don't add any extra salt as the mix is already quite salty.  If you add extra seasoning, it won't get any spicier, it will just get saltier.\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Mexican recipes]]\n[[Category:Tex-Mex recipes]]\n[[Category:Spicy recipes]]\n[[Category:Fish recipes]]\n[[Category:Freshwater fish recipes]]\n[[Category:Pan fried]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#masaharina #salmon #egg #plainflour #breadcrumbs #smokedsalmon #tacoseasoning #breadcrumb #oliveoil #salads #spices </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
