If the name already rings a bell, it's probably because you've seen Wahaca's co-founder, Cheltenham born Thomasina Miers on Channel 5's ''Mexican Food Made Simple'' tv cookery program or maybe you remember her as BBC 2's 2005 ''Masterchef'' winner.\n\nWe popped in for a light early evening meal and were instantly impressed.  It has the ''cool'' buzz that I remember from Bob Payton's ''Chicago Pizza Pie Factory'' way back in the 80's.  When we left it even had the matching hoards of people queuing down the stairs to get a table.\n\nFor under \u00a320 we had the Wahaca Street Food Selection for 2 people: 3 pork pibil [[tacos]], 3 winter vegetable [[tacos]], 1 large huitlacoche [[quesadilla]], 2 [[black bean]] tostadas and 2 chicken [[taquitos]] with green rice & [[black beans]].  My favourite way to eat, lots of little portions of different flavoured dishes, which you can eat with your fingers. Unlike some British Mexican restaurant offerings that appear to come straight from the microwave or the deep fat frier, these were cooked to order and packed with fresh vegetables.  Oh and don't forget the mandatory selection of [[hot sauces]] on your table. \n<gallery widths=250px perrow=5>\nImage:Wahaca Covent garden 4.jpg|Facia - Wahaca, 66 Chandos St, Covent Garden, London WC2N 4HG\nImage:Wahaca Covent garden 3.jpg|Lobby / Reception area Wahaca Covent Garden\nImage:Wahaca Mexican Mobile Eating.jpg|The Wahaca Mexican Mobile Eating van, under the trees, Canada Square Park\nImage:Wahaca Covent garden 1.jpg|So light and airy, you would never know you were in the a basement\nImage:Wahaca book of matches - Serrano chilli seeds.jpg|Not a book of matches, the complimentary packet of Serrano chilli seeds we were given as we left!\nImage:Wahaca The South Bank Experiment.jpg|The South Bank Experiment<br />Built from 8 recycled shipping containers!\n</gallery>\nThe decor was cleverly done, it was only as we left, I remembered we had actually been in a windowless basement.  The service was impeccable and everyone was was extremely helpful.  A very slick operation that has been replicated in 11 locations in the South East, 13 if you count the 2 Mexican Mobile Eating vans. Congratulations Tommi, I'm already planning another excuse to get back into London for another Mexican feast!\n\n''Update:'' In the short time since this article was written, we've been to even more Wahaca locations, every time the food and service has been exemplary.  Our last visit, to the South bank Experiment, deserves a special mention.  The restaurant overlooks the river, being situated on a the first floor terrace of the 1950's minimalist building, The Queen Elizabeth Hall, which sits between The Royal Festival Hall and The Hayward Gallery. The 'South Bank Experiment' is so named because of the restaurants unique construction materials. 8 recycled shipping containers!  Now that's what I call recycling.  It also affords wonderful views of the river and should you want to eat on the move, the mobile eating truck is at river level in front of the restaurant.\n\n===Geographic Locations===\n: '''Wahaca Bluewater'''\n: The Plaza:, Bluewater\n: Greenhithe\n: Kent, DA9 9SG\n: '''T:''' +44 (0) 1322 380211\n: '''E:''' Mailto:bluewater@wahaca.co.uk\n\n: '''Wahaca Canary Wharf'''\n: The Park Pavilion\n: Canada Square\n: Canary Wharf\n: London, E14 5FW\n: '''T:''' +44 (0) 207 516 9145\n: '''E:''' Mailto:canarywharf@wahaca.co.uk\n\n: '''Wahaca Canary Wharf Mexican Street Kitchen'''\n: Under the trees\n: Canada Square Park\n: London, E14 5FW\n\n: '''Wahaca Charlotte Street'''\n: 19 - 23 Charlotte Street\n: London, W1T 1RL\n: '''T:''' +44 (0) 20 7323 2342\n: '''E:''' Mailto:charlottestreet@wahaca.co.uk\n\n: '''Wahaca Covent Garden'''\n: 66 Chandos Place\n: Covent Garden\n: London, WC2N 4HG\n: '''T:''' +44 (0) 207 240 1883\n: '''E:''' Mailto:coventgarden@wahaca.co.uk\n\n: '''Wahaca Islington'''\n: 68 \u2013 69 Upper Street\n: Islington\n: London, N1 0NY\n: '''T:''' +44 (0) 20 3697 7990\n: '''E:''' Mailto:Islington@wahaca.co.uk\n\n: '''Wahaca Soho'''\n: 80 Wardour Street\n: Soho\n: London, W1F OTF\n: '''T:''' +44 (0) 207 734 0195\n: '''E:''' Mailto:soho@wahaca.co.uk\n\n: '''The Wahaca Southbank Experiment'''\n: Queen Elizabeth Hall\n: Southbank Centre\n: Belvedere Road\n: London, SE1 8XX\n: '''T:''' +44 (0) 207 928 1876\n: '''E:''' Mailto:southbank@wahaca.co.uk\n\n: '''Wahaca St.Paul's'''\n: First Floor\n: One New Change\n: London, EC2V 6AG\n: '''T:''' +44 (0) 20 3002 2626\n: '''E:''' Mailto:stpauls@wahaca.co.uk\n\n: '''Wahaca Stratford'''\n: 6 Chestnut Plaza\n: Westfield Stratford City\n: London, E20 1GL\n: '''T:''' +44 (0) 203 288 1025\n: '''E:''' Mailto:stratford@wahaca.co.uk\n\n: '''Wahaca Waterloo'''\n: 119 Waterloo Road\n: London, SE1 8UL\n: '''t:''' +44 (0) 20 3697 4140\n: '''E:''' Mailto:waterloo@wahaca.co.uk\n\n: '''Wahaca White City'''\n: White City\n: 1074 Westfield Shopping Centre\n: Ariel Way\n: London, W12 7GB\n: '''T:''' +44 (0) 20 8749 4517\n: '''E:''' Mailto:whitecity@wahaca.co.uk\n\n: '''Wahaca Mexican Street Kitchen'''\n: Parked up next to the river\n: Queen Elizabeth Hall\n: Southbank Centre\n: London, SE1 8XX\n==See also==\n* [[Wahaca chilli sauces]]\n===Websites===\n: '''[http://www.wahaca.co.uk/ www.wahaca.co.uk]'''\n: '''[http://www.wahaca.co.uk/blog/ Tommi's blog]'''\n===Wahaca menus (pdf downloads)===\n* [http://wahaca.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/TABLE_MENU_JAN14_WEB.pdf Wahaca food menu]\n* [http://wahaca.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/SOUTHBANK_TABLE_WINTER2013_WEB1.pdf Wahaca Southbank menu]\n* [http://wahaca.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/breakfastmenu_MARCH14_web.pdf Breakfast menu]\n* [http://wahaca.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/glutenfreemenu_ARTWORK_WINTER_2013_3.pdf Wahaca gluten free menu]\n* [http://wahaca.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/Taco-menu_WEB1.pdf Wahaca lunch menu ''selected restaurants'']\n[[Category:Suppliers]]\n[[Category:Tex-Mex ingredients (supplier)]]\n[[Category:Misc. specialist suppliers]]\n<!--PLEASE LEAVE THE LINES BELOW-->\n{{CategoryLineIngredients}}\n[[Category:Useful information]]\n[[Category:Mexican_recipes]]\n[[Category:Latin American recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:12032020'>#wahacamexicanmarketeatingukrestaurantchain #tacos #suppliers #wahacachillisauces #hotsauces #latinamericanrecipes #blackbeans #blackbean #taquitos #quesadilla </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
