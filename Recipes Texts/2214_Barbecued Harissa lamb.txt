After butterflying the half-leg of lamb, and seeing how cartilaginous and sinewy the meat was, I thought slow cooking would give a far better result than cooking quickly in the oven or even barbecuing.  This was a great decision as the resulting meat just fell apart, juicy and tender.\n\nI placed marinated meat on an uncovered grill tray at the top of the highest setting on my oven (260\u00b0C [500\u00b0F) Gas 10]\tand left for 15 minutes, then I reduced the oven to 180\u00b0C [350\u00b0F - Gas 4] placed meat in an oven tray covered in tin-foil and cooked for another 2.5 hours.  It looks burnt from the picture, but if you look at the kebab in the pitta you'll see how tender it was - with no gristle.\n\n{{Template:Belazu attribution}}\n===Belazu products used in this recipe===\n* [http://www.mybelazu.com/products/extra virgin-olive-oils.html Belazu Extra virgin olive oil]\n* [http://www.mybelazu.com/details/rose-harissa.html Belazu Rose Harissa]\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Barbecue recipes]]\n[[Category:Belazu recipes]]\n[[Category:Recipes from other sites]]\n[[Category:Lamb recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:Mutton recipes]]\n[[Category:Middle Eastern recipes]]\n[[Category:Moroccan recipes]]\n[[Category:North African recipes]]\n[[Category:Spicy recipes]]\n[[Category:Favourite recipes]]\n[[Category:Grilled, griddled or barbecued]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#lamb #barbecuedharissalamb #barbecue #garlic #lemon #harissa #seeds #homemadepittabreads #pestleandmortar #miseenplace #griddled </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
