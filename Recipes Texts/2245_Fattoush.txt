Fattoush salad allows cooks to use seasonal produce by mixing different [[vegetables]] and [[herbs]] according to taste, and also to make use of pitas that have gone stale. The vegetables are cut into relatively larges pieces compared to [[Tabbouleh]] which requires ingredients to be finely chopped. [[Sumac]] is usually used to give Fattoush its sour taste.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 1 [[cucumber]], peeled, deseeded and [[diced]]\n| 6 tablespoons [[extra virgin olive oil]]\n| 3 [[pitta breads]], split in two and cut into 2.5 cm (1\") squares\n| 2 tablespoons torn fresh [[coriander leaves]]\n| 2 tablespoons roughly chopped fresh [[mint]]\n| 2 tablespoons roughly chopped fresh [[parsley]]\n| 1 [[red onion]], cut into 1cm/&frac12;in dice\n| 5 ripe [[Tomatoes, roasted and peeled|tomatoes, peeled, deseeded]] and cut into 1cm/&frac12;in dice\n| 2 [[green bell peppers]], deseeded and cut into thin strips\n| 2 [[cloves of garlic, crushed]]\n| 1 tablespoon of [[sumac]] or the juice of 1 [[lemon]]\n| [[Salt]] and [[freshly ground black pepper]]\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Heat 2 tablespoons of the [[oil]] in a [[frying]] pan and [[fry]] the [[pitta bread]] until it is golden brown.
