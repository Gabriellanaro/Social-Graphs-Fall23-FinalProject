It consists of brown [[Fava beans|fava beans]], partially or completely [[Mashed|mashed]], which are slow-cooked and served with [[Olive oil|olive oil]], chopped [[Parsley|parsley]], [[Onion|onion]], [[Garlic|garlic]], and [[Lemon juice|lemon juice]]. Ful medames is typically eaten with Egyptian [[Bread|bread]] ('eish masri).\n\nThe dish's name derives from the Egyptian language: ful is the Egyptian word for [[Fava beans|fava beans]], and medames is a Coptic word meaning \"buried.\" The second word hints at the original cooking method, which involved burying a sealed pot of water and [[Beans|beans]] under hot coals. This cooking method for [[Beans|beans]] is mentioned in the Jerusalem Talmud, indicating that it has been used in the Middle East at least since the 4th century.\n\nFul medames was exported from Egypt to the Arab World, particularly the Levant and Somalia. Ful medames came to the Horn of Africa when the Egyptians captured Zeila in the beginning of the 19th century. From there, it spread to other regions. In northern Somalia, ful is eaten with a [[Pancake|pancake]]-like [[Bread|bread]] called [[laxoox]]. Ful is also part of Ethiopian cuisine, where it is served with [[flatbread]] and [[mitmita powder]] or [[berebere spice mix]].\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 450 g (1 lb) [[ful beans]], soaked overnight, rinsed and drained\n| 1 tablespoon\tfreshly [[Ground cumin|ground cumin]]\n| 6 [[Cloves garlic, peeled and crushed|cloves garlic, peeled and crushed]]\n| 4 [[Hard-boiled eggs|hard-boiled eggs]], shelled and coarsely chopped\n| 1 handful [[Coriander leaves|coriander leaves]], chopped\n| 1 handful fresh [[Mint leaves|mint leaves]], chopped \n| 2 [[Lemons|lemons]], cut into quarters\n| 1 [[Spanish]] [[Onion|onion]], peeled and sliced\n| [[Sea Salt|sea salt]] and [[Freshly ground black pepper|freshly ground black pepper]]\n}}\n'''To serve'''\n* [[Olive oil]]\n* 6 [[Pitta breads]]\n* 200 ml [[Yogurt]]\n* 4 [[Tomatoes]]\n* Half a [[Cucumber|cucumber]]\n* 150 g Mixed [[Salad|salad leaves]]\n\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n* Preheat the [[oven]] to 120\u00b0 C (250\u00b0 F - gas &frac12;), [fan oven 100\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Place the presoaked [[Beans|beans]] in a [[Casserole dish|casserole dish]], fill with water and cover the [[Beans|beans]] by 2 inches    \n| Add half of the [[Cumin|cumin]], Crushed [[Garlic|garlic]] and lots of [[Black pepper|black pepper]], cover and cook for 4 hours until the [[Beans|beans]] are soft.
