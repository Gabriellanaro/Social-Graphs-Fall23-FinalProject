The original recipe was from one of the wonderful Moro books by Sam and Sam Clark, but as always, when it comes to cooking it, I use up bits and bobs found in the fridge and change it out of all recognition to the original recipe.\n\nThe fatty pork chop would '''never''' be in the original recipe which would be muslim in origin, however, it was spare in the fridge and adds a nice flavour to the oil\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 4 tablespoons [[Olive oil|olive oil]]\n| 2 teaspoons white [[Cumin seeds|cumin seeds]] & 1 teaspoon [[black cumin seeds]], [[Ground|ground]] to  powder in a [[Coffee grinder|coffee grinder]] or [[Pestle and mortar|pestle and mortar]]\n| 1 teaspoon [[ras el hanout]]\n| 1 teaspoon [[Paprika powder|paprika powder]]\n| 1 [[Chile de Arbole]] ground to powder or 1/2 a teaspoon of [[Chili powder|chili powder]]\n| 2 medium [[Onions|onions]], peeled and chopped\n| 4 cloves of [[Garlic|garlic]], peeled and crushed\n| 1 large [[carrot]], peeled and cut into rings\n| 3 [[celery]] hearts with leaves, chopped into moons\n| 1 [[aubergine]], halved and sliced\n| 4 large [[Tomatoes, peeled|tomatoes, peeled]] and chopped\n| 1 [[Lamb shank]], on the bone\n| 1 large fatty [[pork chop]], cut into cubes \n| A splash of [[sherry vinegar]]\n| 1 650 ml cold water\n| 1 teaspoon [[Saffron strands|saffron strands]]. Stand in 2 tablespoons [[Boiling|boiling]] water for 15 minutes or more\n| 300 g [[Frozen peas|frozen peas]]\n| [[Sea Salt|sea salt]] and [[Freshly ground black pepper|freshly ground black pepper]]\n}}\n\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n* [[Skinning tomatoes|Rub the skins off]] the [[Tomatoes|tomatoes]] by [[Blanching|blanching]] water that has boiled and leave for 4 minutes.\n* Infuse the [[Saffron|saffron]] in 2 tablespoons of [[Boiling|boiling]] water for at least 15 minutes\n* Defrost the peas.\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| In a large pan, add the [[Olive oil|olive oil]], [[Onions|onions]] and [[Garlic|garlic]] and saut\u00e9 for 5 minutes until the onions have softened. Add the spices, stir-fry and then add the [[pork]] cubes and the [[lamb shank]] and stir-fry so the oil is flavoured with the spices and the meat is browned a little.\n| [[Deglaze]] the pan with a splash of [[sherry vinegar]]\n| Add the [[carrots]], [[celery]], [[aubergines]], [[tomatoes]], cold water and [[Saffron|saffron]] mix, bring to the [[Boil|boil]], reduce the heat and [[Simmer|simmer]] for 2 hours.\n| Add the [[Peas|peas]], remove the lid and [[Simmer|simmer]] for a further 25 minutes\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe with [[Couscous|couscous]] or crusty [[Bread|bread]]\n===Chef' note===\nDirectly from the pot it was quite liquid, which went very well with fresh bread, the next day though, the gravy had thickened up naturally. If you wanted a thicker sauce, just stir in a few teaspoons of cornflour, mixed with a tablespoon of water and heat for a few minutes whilst stirring.\n==See also==\n{{Tagine-recipe-list}}\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Lamb recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:Middle Eastern recipes]]\n[[Category:North African recipes]]\n[[Category:Stews and casseroles]]\n[[Category:Boiled or simmered]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#celery #lambshank #boiling #sherryvinegar #lambtaginewithtomatoesandpeas #garlic #simmer #saffron #oliveoil #onions #tomatoes </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
