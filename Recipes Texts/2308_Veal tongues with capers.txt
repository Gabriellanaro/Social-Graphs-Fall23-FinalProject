Speak to your butcher, you may be able to buy tongues prepared and ready cooked.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 2 medium tongues of [[Veal|veal]]\n| &#189; a [[Lemon|lemon]] and [[Sea Salt|sea salt]] for cleaning the [[Tongue|tongue]]\n| 2.5 tablespoons [[Sea Salt|sea salt]] (for [[Boiling|boiling]])\n| 200g (7 oz) [[White wine|white wine]]\n| 85g (3.5 oz) [[Carrots|carrots]], peeled and chopped\n| 85g (3.5 oz) [[Onions|onions]], peeled and sliced\n| 3.4 [[Litres|litres]] (6 [[Pints|pints]]) cold water for [[Boiling|boiling]]\n| &#189; teaspoon [[White pepper|white pepper]]\n| 1 hot [[Chilli pepper|chilli pepper]], sliced into rings (de-seeded if desired)\n| 110g (4 oz) [[Butter|butter]]\n| 75g (3 oz) [[Plain flour|plain flour]]\n| 1 tablespoon [[Sea Salt|sea salt]] (for the [[Sauce|sauce]])\n| 110g (4 oz) [[Capers|capers]] (rinsed and drained if [[Salted|salted]])\n| 25g (1 oz) [[Vinegar|vinegar]] (for [[Sauce|sauce]])\n}}\n===Method===\n\n'''cleaning the tongues'''\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Under cold running water, scrub the [[Tongue|tongues]] with a [[Brush|brush]].\n| Rub with half a [[Lemon|lemon]] and a handful of [[Salt|salt]] then leave for 15 minutes\n| Place the tongues in a large pan and cover with cold water\n| Bring to the [[Boil|boil]] and [[Simmer|simmer]] for 12 minutes, skimming any surface scum\n| Remove the tongues and discard the water and quickly rinse in cold water. Clean the pot\n}}\n'''cooking the tongues'''\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Add the tongues to the pot, together with 3.4 [[Litres|litres]] of cold water, the [[Vegetables|vegetables]], [[Wine|wine]], [[Herbs|herbs]] and 2.5 tablespoons of [[Salt|salt]]\n| Bring to the [[Boil|boil]] and [[Simmer|simmer]] until the tongues are cooked (about 2 to 2.5 hours)\n}}\n'''caper sauce'''\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Add the [[Butter|butter]] and [[Flour|flour]], white pepper and salt to a small pan and once the [[Roux|roux]] browns, add enough of the [[Strained|strained]] [[Stock|stock]] to make the [[Sauce|sauce]]. Once it thickens, stir in the [[Chillies|chillies]].\n'''final preparation'''\n| Peel the tongues, removing any gristle, [[Fat|fat]] or connective tissues\n| Slice diagonally, a little less than 1 cm (&frac12;\")\n| Arrange on a large platter and sprinkle with half of the [[Capers|capers]]\n| Pour half of the [[Sauce|sauce]] over the tongues and [[Capers|capers]] and the rest, serve in a sauce dish.  Sprinkle the remaining capers over the final layer of sauce.\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe this dish with [[Boiled potatoes|boiled potatoes]].\n===Chef's notes===\nThe [[Salt|salt]] and [[Butter|butter]] quantities are as in the original recipe, I would probably reduce them if you are at all health conscious.  The original recipe just specifies '[[Vinegar|vinegar]]' - Use your favourite, I dare to suggest [[Sherry vinegar|sherry vinegar]]! \n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Beef recipes]]\n[[Category:Historic recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:Middle Eastern recipes]]\n[[Category:North African recipes]]\n[[Category:Offal recipes]]\n[[Category:Veal recipes]]\n[[Category:Cooking with wine]]\n[[Category:Boiled or simmered]]\n\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#tongue #sauce #vealtongueswithcapers #butter #veal #capers #simmer #vinegar #litres #boil #boiling </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
