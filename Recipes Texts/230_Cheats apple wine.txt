As we have a home-brewing shop in our nearest town I brought some new kit and today have started to make an [[Apple wine|apple wine]].\n\nThis is called Cheat's [[Apple wine|apple wine]] because I have used [[Apple juice|apple juice]], rather than starting from scratch with [[Apples|apples]].  This type of [[Wine|wine]] is ready to [[Drink|drink]] fairly soon after making so is ideal for someone who is impatient.\n\nSee [[#Chef's notes|Chef's notes]] below for [[Yeast|yeast]] and nutrient quantities.\n===[[Servings]]===\nAbout 30 bottles\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 5 [[Litres|litres]] [[Apple juice|apple juice]]\n| 6.5kg [[Sugar|sugar]]\n| General purpose [[Wine|wine]] [[Yeast|yeast]]\n| [[Yeast]] nutrient\n| Water, to make up to 23 [[Litres|litres]]\n}}\n\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n* Sterlise all [[Equipment|equipment]]\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Place all of the ingredients in a large [[Fermenting|fermenting]] bin with space for an airlock in the lid.\n| Stir and take a hydrometer reading if desired.\n| Cover with the lid and plug the airlock space with some cotton wool. \n| Agitate every day, using a sterlised plastic paddle and keep for a week at about 21 [[Degrees|degrees]] [[Celsius|celsius]].\n| Replace the cotton wool with and airlock which has been half-filled with water and keep at about 18 [[Degrees|degrees]] until the desired dryness has been achieved.\n| Rack into demijohns, leave for 2 months and rack again.\n| The [[Wine|wine]] should now be ready to [[Drink|drink]] and can be bottled.\n}}\n===Variations===\n30 bottles is a large quantity and you may prefer to use a 4.5 litre demijohn, which will yield about 6 bottles.\n===Chef's notes===\n[[Yeast]] and nutrients vary.  I used 4 tsps yeast and 5 tsps of nutrient, but you should follow the instructions given on you chosen packet or tub of nutrient and yeast.\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Drink and beverage recipes]]\n[[Category:Cookery cheats]]\n[[Category:Uncooked]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#yeast #wine #cheatsapplewine #degrees #applewine #drink #applejuice #litres #celsius #cookery #fermenting </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
