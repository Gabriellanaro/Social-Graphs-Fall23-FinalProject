Most recipes call for the flesh to be discarded and only the peel to be used, however we have found that it's all good.\n\nAnother great use is a to use a tablespoon or so of the pungent salty juice in salad dressings and dips.\n\nThey also look great in the kitchen and they are simple to make.  This recipe originates from Morocco.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 7 unwaxed [[lemons]]\n| 1 litre bottled [[lemon]] juice (normally about 4 bottles)\n| 2 tablespoons [[coriander seeds]]\n| 4 fresh [[bay leaves]], rinsed under boiling water\n| 7 tablespoons coarse [[sea salt]]\n}}\n===Method===\n\n\nMany recipes call for the juice from fresh [[lemon]]s, but as we use so much of this, we've found bottled lemon juice to be just as good.\n\nTo ensure no bacteria contaminates this preserve, [[sterilise]] everything and use tongs or clean rubber gloves when handling the contents.\n{{RecipeMethod\n| If using waxed [[lemons]] (the norm), wash under very hot water to remove the wax\n| Cut the [[lemons]] into quarters from the top, not completing the cuts so they open like flowers\n| Pack each [[lemon]] with about a tablespoon of [[sea salt]] and place in the jar\n| Add the coriander seeds and the bay leaves\n| Pour in enough [[lemon]] juice to cover the lemons completely\n| If they bob up over the surface, wedge a piece of sterilised plastic over the top [[lemon]] to hold it under the juice. A disposable coffee spoon works well here. \n| Leave for 1 month before use\n| Will keep for upto 1 year, but you'll use them up way before then!\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\n\nUse the rind and flesh in slow cooked stews, tagines, [[couscous]] and [[rice dishes]].\n\nThe juice alone works especially well anywhere [[lemon juice]] and [[salt]] is called for, but with an extra pungent tang.\n\nIf you find they are too salty for certain dishes, refresh them under cold running water before use. \n\n===Chef's notes===\n\nAlthough they look great on the worktop, these keep better if [[Talk:Preserved lemons|stored in the dark]].\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes|Lemons]]\n[[Category:Accompaniments|Lemons]]\n[[Category:Dips and sauces|Lemons]]\n[[Category:Moroccan recipes]]\n[[Category:North African recipes|Lemons]]\n[[Category:Pickles and preserves]]\n[[Category:Marinades_dressings_and_butters|Lemons]]\n[[Category:Fruit recipes]]\n[[Category:Uncooked]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n[[Category:Pickled]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#lemon #preservedlemons #lemons #couscous #corianderseeds #pickled #lemonjuice #sterilise #ricedishes #bayleaves </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
