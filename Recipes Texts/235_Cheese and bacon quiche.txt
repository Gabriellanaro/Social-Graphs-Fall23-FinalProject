This one used bits and bobs we had lying about; it was fabulous.  Very juicy, which I think must have been the re-hydrated [[Taste Sensation Sun-dried Tomatoes Diced]] coupled with the fresh [[Tomatoes|tomatoes]].\n\nNormally, using a metal flan tin a percentage of the pasty is always left-over and wasted, this time I used the cast [[Iron|iron]] [[Le Creuset]]  rectangular [[Oven|oven]] dish.  The [[Pastry|pastry]] fitted perfectly, with no wastage.\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| 1 pack [[Ready rolled shortcrust pastry|ready rolled shortcrust pastry]]\n| 5 large [[Eggs|eggs]]\n| 3 tablespoons [[cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche]]\n| Pinch of [[Dried|dried]] [[Parsley|parsley]]\n| A big pinch of [[Freshly ground black pepper|freshly ground black pepper]]\n| 1 tablespoon [[Olive oil|olive oil]]\n| 1 small [[Onion|onion]], peeled and chopped finely\n| 5 rashers of [[Bacon|bacon]], chopped into small pieces\n| 2 [[Cloves of garlic, crushed|cloves of garlic, crushed]]\n| 150 g [[Grated|grated]] [[Cheddar cheese]]\n| 50 g [[French]] [[Brie|brie]], chopped into small cubes\n| 3 tablespoons [[Taste Sensation Sun-dried Tomatoes Diced]]\n| 10 [[Cherry tomatoes|cherry tomatoes]], sliced\n| Good pinch of sweet [[Paprika powder|paprika powder]]\n}}\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n\n* Soak the [[Dehydrated|dehydrated]] [[Sun-dried tomatoes|sun-dried tomatoes]] in water for 3 hours\n* Drain in a [[Sieve|sieve]] before use.\n* Pre-heat you [[Oven|oven]] to 180\u00b0 C (350\u00b0 F - gas 4), [fan oven 160\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]\n\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| Remove the pre-rolled [[Pastry|pastry]] from the [[Fridge|fridge]] and leave at room temperature for an hour to allow easy handling\n| Roll the [[Pastry|pastry]] into the [[Oven tray|oven tray]]\n| Cover with [[Greaseproof paper|greaseproof paper]]\n| Fill the paper with [[Baking beans|baking beans]] and [[Blind bake|blind bake]] for 15 minutes at 180\u00b0 C \n| Remove the [[Beans|beans]] and [[Greaseproof paper|greaseproof paper]] and prick the [[Pastry|pastry]] all over with a fork\n| Return to the [[Oven|oven]] and [[Bake|bake]] for a further 7 minutes to crisp up\n| Meanwhile [[Fry|fry]] the [[Onions|onions]] for 5 minutes in the [[Olive oil|olive oil]] and [[Freshly ground black pepper|freshly ground black pepper]], adding the [[Crushed garlic|crushed garlic]] for the last few minutes\n| [[Stir fry]] the [[Bacon|bacon]] in this mixture until it is slightly [[Browned|browned]] and all of the  moisture is bubbled off from the bacon\n| [[Whisk]] the [[Eggs|eggs]], [[cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche]] and [[Parsley|parsley]] together until smooth\n| Remove the [[Pastry|pastry]] from the [[Oven|oven]] and allow to cool for 10 minutes\n| Dot the [[Brie|brie]] evenly over the [[Pastry|pastry]] base\n| Pour in the [[Egg|egg]] mixture and evenly distribute the remaining main ingredients evenly over the mix, topping with half of the [[Cheddar cheese]] and a sprinkle of [[Paprika|paprika]]\n| [[Bake]] for 40 minutes at  160\u00b0 C - checking after 30 to ensure the [[Pastry|pastry]] does not burn\n}}\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\n</gallery>\n\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe with a [[Green salad|green salad]]\n===Chef's notes===\nThe long preparation time is due to the time it takes to rehydrate the [[Sun-dried tomatoes|sun-dried tomatoes]].
