It's also a nice way to cook chicken.\n\nTraditional [[Harissa paste|harissa paste]] really [[Spices|spices]] up the [[Couscous|couscous]].\n\nTo serve less, use the same amount of rub and herbs, just cover with less stock.  One chicken leg per person is ample.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 1.3 kg [[Chicken|chicken]] pieces (6 chicken legs) \n| 1 teaspoon [[Ground|ground]] [[Ginger|ginger]] \n| 1 teaspoon [[Black pepper|black pepper]] \n| 1 teaspoon [[Salt|salt]] \n| 1 sachet [[Saffron|saffron]] filaments \n| 4 tablespoons of [[Belazu]] [[Argan oil]] \n| 1 [[Onion|onion]], peeled and sliced\n| 200 ml [[Chicken stock]] or [[vegetable stock]] to cover the chicken pieces.\n| Big sprig of your choice of herbs - [[Bouquet garni|a good list of suggestions here]]\n| 120 g [[couscous]] (''Follow the link for cooking instructions'')\n}}\n\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Put the [[Chicken|chicken]] pieces in a bowl with the [[Ginger|ginger]], [[Pepper|pepper]], [[Salt|salt]] and [[Saffron|saffron]]. Rub these in using your hands.\n|[[Brown|brown]] in a [[wok]] or [[Casserole dish|casserole dish]] with the [[argan oil]].\n| Add the sliced [[Onion|onion]], and soften for 2-3 minutes, then top up with enough stock to just cover the chicken pieces.\n| Make a [[Herb|herb]] bundle by tying the herb sprigs together with [[kitchen string]] and add to the [[wok]] or [[Casserole|casserole]]. | Bring to the [[Boil|boil]] then reduce to a [[Simmer|simmer]] for 30 minutes or until cooked.\n| Remove the cooked chicken and serve, discarding the stock and herbs.\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe with  [[Harissa paste|harissa paste]] and [[Barley|barley]] [[Couscous|couscous]] or normal couscous.\n===Chef's notes===\nThe original recipe did not specify the cuts of chicken to use, but in this type of dish the flavour is much improved by using cuts that include the bone rather than fillets.  I would skin them first though so the end result is not too greasy.\n\nHalf a [[green pepper]] was chopped and added to the [[couscous]] together with some dried fruit that had been soaked in sherry for 30 minutes.  The rest of the pepper was added to the chicken casserole and discarded once the chicken was cooked.\n\nI used [[fennel]], [[parsley]], [[mint]] and a small amount of [[rosemary]] in my [[bouquet garni]].\n{{Template:Belazu attribution}}\n* [http://www.mybelazu.com/details/argan-oil.html Belazu Argan Oil]\n* [http://www.mybelazu.com/details/rose-harissa.html Belazu Rose Harissa]\n* [http://www.mybelazu.com/details/traditional-barley-couscous.html Belazu Traditional Barley Couscous]\n==See also==\n* {{See also - Jointing a chicken}}\n{{Template:PeelingGinger}}\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Belazu recipes|Chicken couscous]]\n[[Category:Grain and bean recipes|Chicken couscous]]\n[[Category:Main courses|Chicken couscous]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes|Chicken couscous]]\n[[Category:Middle Eastern recipes|Chicken couscous]]\n[[Category:Moroccan recipes|Chicken couscous]]\n[[Category:North African recipes|Chicken couscous]]\n[[Category:Poultry recipes|Chicken couscous]]\n[[Category:Spicy recipes|Chicken couscous]]\n[[Category:Stews and casseroles|Chicken couscous]]\n[[Category:Tunisian recipes|Chicken couscous]]\n[[Category:Stewed, braised or pot roasted]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#belazuchickencouscous #couscous #arganoil #ginger #chicken #onion #saffron #harissapaste #wok #bouquetgarni #herb </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
