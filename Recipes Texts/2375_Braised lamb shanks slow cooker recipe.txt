It goes excellently with [[couscous]] and is quite filling so one lamb shank could stretch to two people.\n\n===Ingredients for 2 to 4 people===\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| 2 or 3 small [[Lamb shanks|lamb shanks]] \n| 200g [[Shallots|shallots]], peeled ([[Shallots|see here for a neat trick]])\n| 1 medium [[Aubergine|aubergines]], cut into small [[Dice|dice]] \n| 2 tablespoons [[Olive oil|olive oil]] \n| 1 tablespoon of [[Harissa paste]] (I use my own and it's quite hot!) \n| Zest of 1 [[Orange|orange]] and [[Juice|juice]] of 2 large [[Oranges|oranges]] (''no more'')\n| 100ml medium [[Sherry|sherry]] \n| 375 g [[Passata|passata]] (or 1 400g can of chopped tomatoes) \n| 150 ml hot [[Vegetable|vegetable]] or [[Lamb stock|lamb stock]] \n| 50g dried [[apricots]] (soaked in the sherry if you have the time)\n| 75 g stoned [[cherries]]\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{recipeMethod\n\n| Heat just a teaspoon of the the oil in a large flameproof [[dutch oven]] or [[wok]] and [[Brown|brown]] the shanks all over. Allow about 8 minutes to do this as the better the colour now, the better the flavour and look of the finished dish.\n| Remove the [[Lamb|lamb]] and set aside. Add the [[Shallots|shallots]], [[Aubergine|aubergine]] and remaining [[Olive oil|olive oil]] to the [[Casserole|casserole]]. Return the casserole to the hob and cook everything together over a high heat, stirring from time to time, until the shallots and aubergine are golden and beginning to soften.\n| Add all of the ingredients to the [[slow cooker]], set to medium and cook for 5 hours.\n}}\n===Serving suggestion===\nServe with plain [[couscous]].  This is quite fruity and needs a bland accompaniment.\n\n===Chef's note===\nIt would probably be cooked in 3 hours, but I like to stew lamb long and slow if I have the time, it seems to extract all of the flavours.  It certainly smells fantastic during the last few hours of cooking.\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Braised Lamb Shanks after 5 hours.jpg|After 5 hours cooking\nImage:Braised Lamb Shanks ingredients.jpg|Braised Lamb Shanks, the ingredients (for 2)\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Slow roast recipes]]\n{{Template:Belazu attribution}}\n===Belazu products used in this recipe===\n* [http://www.mybelazu.com/details/rose-harissa.html Belazu Rose Harissa]\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes|Lamb shanks]]\n[[Category:Belazu recipes|Lamb shanks]]\n[[Category:Recipes from other sites|Lamb shanks]]\n[[Category:Chilli pepper recipes|Lamb shanks]]\n[[Category:Lamb recipes|Lamb shanks]]\n[[Category:Main courses|Lamb shanks]]\n[[Category:Mutton recipes|Lamb shanks]]\n[[Category:Moroccan recipes|Lamb shanks]]\n[[Category:North African recipes|Lamb shanks]]\n[[Category:Spicy recipes|Lamb shanks]]\n[[Category:Slow cooker recipes|Lamb shanks]]\n[[Category:Stews and casseroles|Lamb shanks]]\n[[Category:Cooking with wine|Lamb shanks]]\n[[Category:Fruit recipes|Lamb shanks]]\n[[Category:Favourite recipes|Lamb shanks]]\n[[Category:Slow cooked]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#couscous #slowcooker #oliveoil #aubergine #shallots #lambstock #vegetable #apricots #unusualrecipes #passata #dice </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
