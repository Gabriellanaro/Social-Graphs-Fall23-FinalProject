This will need to be started the day before you want to [[Bake|bake]] it.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 200g [[Sourdough|sourdough]] leaven\n| 500g [[Strong white bread flour|strong white bread flour]]\n| 325g [[Sparkling mineral water|sparkling mineral water]]\n| 30g [[Onion|onion]] powder\n| 1 teaspoon finely crushed [[Sea Salt|sea salt]] or Rose Pink Himalayan [[Rock salt|rock salt]]\n| 125g [[Parmesan]], [[Grated|grated]] (See '''Variations''' below)\n| 125g [[Tickler cheese|Tickler cheese]], [[Grated|grated]]\n| 75g (after stones have been removed) [[Black olives|black olives]], chopped\n\n}}\n\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n* If your [[Sourdough|sourdough]] leaven has been in the [[Fridge|fridge]], remove it the day before you want to start making your [[Bread|bread]] and refresh it with 50g [[Flour|flour]] and 40g water. \n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Mix the [[Sourdough|sourdough]] leaven with 250g of the [[Flour|flour]] and all of the water and leave for several hours.\n| Add the remaining [[Flour|flour]] and the [[Onion|onion]] powder, [[Knead|knead]] according to your chosen method and shape into a ball.\n| Place in an oiled bowl, cover with [[Clingfilm|clingfilm]] and [[Refrigerate|refrigerate]] overnight.\n| Remove from the [[Fridge|fridge]] and leave at room temperature until it has almost doubled in size.\n| Gently deflate, shape into a ball and again, place in an oiled bowl, cover and leave to rise a second time.\n| When it has almost doubled in size, mix in the [[Salt|salt]], [[Cheeses|cheeses]] and the chopped [[Olives|olives]].\n| Shape and place in a 900g loaf tin and leave to prove until it has risen to the top of the tin.\n| Preheat the [[Oven|oven]] to its highest temperature.\n| Slash if desired and [[Bake|bake]] for 30-40 minutes, reducing the temperature to 220\u00b0 C (425\u00b0 F - gas 7), [fan [[Oven|oven]] 200\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour].\n| After 30 minutes, remove from tin and place upside down on a baking tray.  Return to the oven for a further 10-15 minutes.\n| Allow to cool on a wire rack.\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nGreat with salad.\n===Variations===\nUse any combination of hard, strong [[Cheese|cheese]] you like.  As there is no [[Vegetarian|vegetarian]] [[Parmesan]], use [[Bookhams not just a pasta cheese]] which is a vegetarian cheese made in a similar way to [[Parmesan]] and is available in branches of Waitrose.  [[Tickler cheese|Tickler]] is a vegetarian [[Cheddar]] type cheese available in most supermarkets.\n===Chef's notes===\nMake sure your tin is oiled well with [[oil|groundnut oil]] or line with [[Bake-O-Glide]]. \n==See also==\n* [[Rye sourdough starter]]\n* [[Spelt sourdough starter]]\n* [[Cheese and olive sourdough]]\n* [https://sites.google.com/site/nikandedwinascookbook/Home/bread/full-sourdough Sourdough recipe] from Nik and Edwina \n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Bread and baking]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#cheeseandolivesourdough #sourdough #flour #parmesan #fridge #grated #onion #bread #ticklercheese #bake #vegetarian </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
