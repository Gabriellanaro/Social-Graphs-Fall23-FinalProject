With a sort [[cheese]] that won't grate easily, you may be better to mould potato mixture around the cheese rather than mix in with the [[potatoes]].\n\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 3 large [[baking]] [[potatoes]] (Desiree, Estima, Marfona or Vivaldi) if you can get them\n| 110 g (4 oz) [[Emmental]] or [[Cheddar cheese]], [[grated]]\n| 3 tablespoons [[butter]] or [[olive oil]]\n| 2 [[spring onions]], [[chopped on the diagonal]]\n| 2 [[egg]], beaten\n|  50 g (2 oz) [[plain flour]]\n| Bunch of [[parsley leaves]], chopped\n| [[Salt]] and [[freshly ground black pepper]]\n| Pinch if [[chili powder]] (optional)\n| 2 tablespoons [[sesame seeds]]\n| 50 g (2 oz) fresh [[breadcrumbs]]\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| [[Bake]] the [[potatoes]] at 180\u00b0 C (350\u00b0 F - Gas 4) for 1 hour or until cooked; allow to cool so they can be handled. Peel and [[mash]] with a [[potato masher]] or [[potato ricer]].\n| In a bowl, combine the [[cheese]], [[spring onions]], one of the [[eggs]], [[parsley]], [[salt]] and [[pepper]], [[chili powder]] if using, and [[potatoes]].\n| Squish up the mixture with your (clean) hands so it's well combined.\n| Pour the [[breadcrumbs]] onto a plate and mix in the [[sesame seeds]].\n| Mould the croquettes into shape, a bit bigger than golf-balls, then roll into sausage shapes\n| Dredge these in the [[flour]], then in the beaten [[egg]] mixture, then roll then in the [[breadcrumbs]]\n| Refrigerate for 30 minutes to set\n| Preheat the oven to 180\u00b0 C (350\u00b0 F - Gas 4)\n| Place the croquettes on a non-stick [[baking]] tray and [[bake]] for 35 minutes or until golden brown.\n}}\n===Chef's tip===\n\nThe next time you cook [[jacket potatoes]], add a few extra and save them for making this dish.  They'll keep in the [[fridge]] for a few days.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Garlic and cornmeal potato nuggets]]\n* http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croquette\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Accompaniments]]\n[[Category:Cheese recipes]]\n[[Category:Starters]]\n[[Category:Snacks and light bites]]\n[[Category:Potato recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegetable recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:French recipes]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#potatoes #breadcrumbs #cheeseandpotatocroquettes #cheese #egg #springonions #baking #sesameseeds #bake #chilipowder #flour </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
