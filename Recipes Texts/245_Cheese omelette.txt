Either way, I would not recommend making a single omelette for more that three people as it would not cook properly.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 2 large free-range [[eggs]]\n| 50 g ( 2 oz) gruyere cheese, grated\n| Salt and freshly ground [[black pepper]] to taste\n| Splash of [[cream]] or [[milk]] (optional)\n| 1 tablespoon [[butter]] or olive oil\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Break the [[eggs]] into a bowl with the salt, pepper, milk and cheese\n| Mix roughly with a knife. Don't whisk - it's nice to get some white and yolk only areas in the omelette\n| Add the [[butter]] to a small frying pan\n| When the [[butter]] is foaming add the mixture to the pan\n| Fry for 2 minutes on this side, pulling the solid edges to the centre with a fork\n| Flip over and fry for 1 minute on the other side\n| Slide on to a warm serving plate, folding the omelette - the last bit of cooking is done one the plate this way\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe immediately\n\n===Variations===\nExperiment with various cheeses, chopped herbs such as [[chives]] or parsley.\n\nRub the pan with half a [[Garlic|garlic]] clove prior to frying (discard the garlic).\n\nAdd a handful of microwaved mixed vegetables just before folding over.\n\n{{OmeletteRecipes}}\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Cheese recipes]]\n[[Category:Egg recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Student recipes]]\n[[Category:Pan fried]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#butter #cheeseomelette #eggs #blackpepper #garlic #panfried #chives #cream </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
