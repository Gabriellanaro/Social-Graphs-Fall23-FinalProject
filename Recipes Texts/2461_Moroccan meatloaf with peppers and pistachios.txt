It is a wonderfully fragrant dish and would be brilliant for dinner parties (if we had such things). The lamb was perfectly moist and slightly pink in the centre. We had this with [[seedy naans]] and [[tzatziki]].\n[[Image:Moroccan meatloaf with pomegranate molasses.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Fresh out of the oven]]\n \nI 'created' this dish because I wanted to try out my recently obtained [[ras el hanout]] and [[pomegranate molasses]]. \nIf you don't have [[ras el hanout]], see the [[ras el hanout]] page and make your own spice mix.\n\nThough not a replacement for [[pomegranate molasses]], a sprinkle of [[sugar]] or runny [[honey]] and the juice and zest of an [[orange]] or [[tangerine]] would work just as well.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 1 tablespoon [[Sunflower oil|sunflower oil]]\n| 1 [[Onion|onion]], peeled and chopped\n| 3 [[Cloves garlic, crushed|cloves garlic, crushed]]\n| 2 teaspoons [[ras el hanout]]\n| 1 teaspoon [[Chili powder|chili powder]] or [[chili flakes]]\n| [[Freshly ground black pepper]] and salt to taste\n| 500g [[Minced|minced]] [[Lamb|lamb]]\n| 1 [[Egg|egg]], beaten\n| 50 g [[bulgur wheat]] soaked in 1 pint of warm water for 30 minutes then drained\n| 40 g [[Pistachios|pistachios]], husks removed, (80g with shells)\n| 1 large [[Red pepper|red pepper]], [[Roasted|roasted]] and peeled and chopped finely\n| 3 tablespoons [[pomegranate molasses]]\n| 6 [[Dried apricots|dried apricots]], chopped\n| 4 bay leaves\n\n}}\n\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n* Preheat the [[oven]] to 180\u00b0 C (350\u00b0 F - gas 4), [fan oven 160\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Lighly grease a small loaf tin\n| Heat the [[Oil|oil]] in a pan and [[Fry|fry]] the [[Onion|onion]] and [[Garlic|garlic]] until translucent, about 5 minutes\n| Add the [[Spices|spices]], [[salt]] and [[pepper]] and [[Fry|fry]] off for another minute or so then remove from the heat\n| Add the onions to a bowl together with the uncooked [[lamb]], [[bulgur wheat]], beaten [[egg]], [[Pistachios|pistachios]], and [[Peppers|peppers]] and combine with your hands\n| Pack the mix into the loaf tin, brush the surface with 3 tablespoons of [[pomegranate molasses]], scatter the chopped [[apricots]] over the top and garnish with the [[bay leaves]]\n| Leave to stand for a few hours. I felt this was needed to ensure the [[bulgur]] soaked up the surrounding moisture. It may not be needed, it certainly won't hurt though.\n| Stand the meatloaf tin in a deep [[roasting dish]], half-filled with [[Boiling|boiling]] water\n| Cover the the large dish with [[tin foil]] and [[Bake|bake]] for 30 minutes\n| Remove the [[foil]], take the tray out of the [[bain marie]] and [[Bake|bake]] uncovered for a further 10 minutes\n| Remove from the oven and allow to rest for 15 minutes\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe sliced, hot or cold\n\nServe with [[Batatas harras (Lebanese spiced potatoes)]]\n===Variations===\n* Add a sprinkle of [[almond flakes]] once it's out of the [[bain marie]]\n* Try [[sultanas]] instead of [[apricots]].\n* This could also be made with [[Minced beef|minced beef]]\n* Line the baking dish with streaky [[Bacon|bacon]] - not very Moroccan though!\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Lamb recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:Moroccan recipes]]\n[[Category:North African recipes]]\n[[Category:Fruit recipes]]\n[[Category:Favourite recipes]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#pomegranatemolasses #raselhanout #bulgurwheat #fry #moroccanmeatloafwithpeppersandpistachios #onion #egg #apricots #bake #pistachios #bainmarie </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
