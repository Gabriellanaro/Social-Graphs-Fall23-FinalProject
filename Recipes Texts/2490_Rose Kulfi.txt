It is normally served in small dome shaped moulds, but also works as scooped [[Ice cream|ice cream]] that is not too melted. \n\nWe have discovered that if you have an [[Ice cream maker|ice cream maker]] that this also works really well. The timings can be shorter, but it does maintain that complexity yet is lighter.\"\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 1 litre half [[Fat|fat]]  [[Milk|milk]] \n| 55g [[Caster sugar|caster sugar]] \n| 3 [[Cardamom|cardamom]] pod, [[Split|split]]\n| 125ml [[Double cream|double cream]], whipped until firm but not stiff \n| 1-2 teaspoons [[Rosewater|rosewater]] according to taste\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Put the [[Milk|milk]] and [[Cardamom|cardamom]] pod in a large heavy based saucepan, bring to the [[Boil|boil]] and [[Simmer|simmer]] for 25 minutes or until reduced to 750ml \n| Add the [[Sugar|sugar]], and stir well. Return to heat and [[Boil|boil]] for a further 15 minutes or until reduced to 500ml. Allow to cool fully, leaving the [[Cardamom|cardamom]] pod in the [[Milk|milk]] \n| When cool, remove the [[Cardamom|cardamom]] and whisk in the [[Cream|cream]] and [[Rosewater|rosewater]]. Either put into an [[Ice cream maker|ice cream maker]], or [[Freeze|freeze]] in small moulds for 6-8 hours\n}}\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:North African recipes]]\n[[Category:Sweets and desserts]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes]]\n[[Category:Nik and Edwina's Cookbook recipes]]\n[[Category:Recipes from other sites]]\n\n[[Category:Uncooked]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#cardamom #icecreammaker #rosekulfi #boil #rosewater #freeze #split #amazon #cream #icecream #india </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
