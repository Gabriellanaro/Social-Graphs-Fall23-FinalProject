As long as the cooking liquid does not dry out and the joint is well sealed with [[tin-foil]] cooking for an extended time should not do any harm.\n==See also==\n* '''[[Meat cooking time calculator Metric|A comprehensive guide to roast meat cooking times]]''' - give the time you want to carve your roast and we'll give you a timed step by step roasting guide\n* [[Slow roast recipes]]\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:North African recipes]]\n[[Category:Tunisian recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Lamb recipes]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:Mutton recipes]]\n[[Category:Moroccan recipes]]\n[[Category:FotoosVanRobin recipes]]\n[[Category:Recipes from other sites]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#garlic #slowroastlambshoulderwitharaselhanoutrub #lamb #rosemary #oliveoil #thymeleaves #roastingtin #mutton #drysherry #unusualrecipes #lambjoint </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
