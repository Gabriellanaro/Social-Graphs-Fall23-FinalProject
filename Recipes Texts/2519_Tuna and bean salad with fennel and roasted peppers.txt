Brilliant with [[Fish|fish]]. Add some [[Beans|beans]] for body, [[Peppers|peppers]] for richness and [[Sherry vinegar|sherry vinegar]], just because you can, you have a complete, gorgeous meal. Try it\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 1 400 g can of [[Haricot beans|haricot beans]], rinsed many times and then drained.\n| 2 sweet [[Bell peppers|bell peppers]], any colour.\n| 1 [[Fennel bulb|fennel bulb]], sliced finely, green tops reserved, if you are lucky enough to find a seller that retains them!\n| Half an [[Onion|onion]], very thinly sliced.\n| A small handful of freshly chopped [[oregano leaves]].\n| A large handful of freshly chopped [[parsley leaves]].\n| [[Sea salt]] to taste.\n| 2 fresh [[tuna]] steaks sliced in half to make 4 thin steaks , (about 100 g each) so they cook quickly. \n| 4 tablespoons of [[extra virgin olive oil]].\n| A squeeze of fresh [[lemon juice]].\n| 1 teaspoon [[fennel seeds]], crushed in a [[mortar and pestle]].\n| 3 teaspoons of [[sherry vinegar]].\n\n}}\n\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n* Preheat a barbecue or oven griddle.\n# [[Roasted red pepper|Roast the bell peppers as shown here]], remove skin and seeds then tear into strips.\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n|Cover the beans in fresh water, no salt, and warm them through, remove from the heat and leave in the cooking water.\n| Place the [[fennel seeds]], sliced [[fennel]] and [[onions]] together with the roasted pepper strips and oregano in a serving bowl. Add half of the parsley and reserved fennel tops if you had any. Toss well.\n| Brush the tuna steaks with olive oil and season with salt.\n| Sear on a hot griddle for 1 minutes a side.  Remove and rest, covered, for 4 minutes. \n| Meanwhile, drain the beans and add to the salad bowl.\n| Drizzle with [[sherry vinegar]], [[lemon juice]] and the remaining [[olive oil]].\n| Serve the tuna on individual plates, laid over the salad, sprinkled with the remaining chopped herbs.\n}}\n===Alternatives===\nTry a variety of [[beans]], most beans work very well in a salad like this.  [[Butter beans]], [[chick peas]]. [[kidney beans]] etc.  Dried beans are good too if you remember to prepare them ahead of time.\n===Chef's note===\nIf you can't find [[sherry vinegar]], then try harder as it's an invaluable condiment Or use [[red wine vinegar]] with a pinch of sugar!\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Barbecue recipes]]\n[[Category:Fish recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:North African recipes]]\n[[Category:Salad recipes]]\n[[Category:Sea fish recipes]]\n[[Category:Spanish recipes]]\n[[Category:Cooking with wine]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#sherryvinegar #fennel #beans #onion #fennelseeds #tunaandbeansaladwithfennelandroastedpeppers #lemonjuice #oreganoleaves #aniseed #chickpeas #fish </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
