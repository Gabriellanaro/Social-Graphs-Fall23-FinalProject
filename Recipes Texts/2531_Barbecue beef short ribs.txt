We had similar ribs to this at Bodean's [[Barbecue]] Restaurant, by The Tower of London, after a [http://www.walks.com/London_Walks_Home/Saturdays_Walks/default.aspx#12939 Jack The Ripper walk] with some great friends of ours.\n\nThis recipe takes 8 hours to cook, so make sure that you allow enough time!\n\nAsk your butcher for '[[beef short ribs]] from the plate', or [[Argentine ribs]]. You don't want back ribs as these are not the same.  I understand from talking to a butcher that this particular cut of [[beef]] is also known as 'Jacob's ladder'.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| A halved 4 bone rack of [[beef short ribs]] 'from the plate', (about 1kg)\n| 5 tablespoons [[American squeezy mustard]]\n}}\n'''there's the rub'''\n* 2 teaspoons [[Chilli powder|chilli powder]] (or to taste)\n* 4 tablespoons [[Spanish]] [[Smoked paprika|smoked paprika]]\n* &#189; tablespoon [[Sea Salt|sea salt]]\n* &#189; tablespoon [[Ground black pepper|ground black pepper]]\n* 2 tablespoons [[Tomato|tomato]] pur\u00e9e\n* 2 tablespoons [[Olive oil|olive oil]]\n* 2 tablespoons ruby [[port]]\n'''here's the [[Marinade|marinade]]'''\n* 4 tablespoons [[muscovado sugar]]\n* 2 tablespoons good [[Honey|honey]], warmed in the [[Microwave|microwave]] for a few seconds to make it runny\n* 1 tablespoon [[Butter|butter]]\n* 1 beef [[Oxo cube]], crumbled\n* 2 tablespoons water\n\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n* Preheat the [[Oven|oven]] to 120\u00b0 C (250\u00b0 F - gas &frac12;)\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Beef_short_ribs_rub_8_hours.jpg|After 8 hours\nImage:Beef_short_ribs_rub_7_hours.jpg|After 7 hours\nImage:Beef_short_ribs_rub_covered.jpg|Meat-side up, covered in the rub\nImage:Beef_short_ribs.jpg|1.1kg of [[beef short ribs]], bone-side up\n</gallery>\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Make shallow criss-cross cuts on the meats side of the ribs.\n| Mix the rub ingredients together in a bowl and mix well.\n| Paint this all over the meat, getting it into all of the cuts and areas where your butcher has removed excess fat.\n| If you have the time, place the ribs in a [[Lock and Lock]] style box and leave in a cool lace for a few hours before you start the cooking process.\n| Pop the ribs in a lightly greased [[roasting tray]], bone-side down, cover the tin with a layer of [[baking foil]] and [[Roast|roast]] for 6 hours.\n| After 6 hours, remove the tin-foil covering, drain and reserve and refrigerate the juices, they make a wonderful chilli-beef dripping!\n| Gently heat the [[Marinade|marinade]] ingredients in a small pan, stirring until you have a liquid mix.\n| Tear a few large sheets of really strong [[Tin-foil|tin-foil]] ([[Tin-foil#Heavy-duty tin foil|Bacofoil Classic]] is ideal as it's so thick and strong).\n| Put the ribs in the foil, bone-side up and paint the [[Marinade|marinade]] all over with a silicone [[Brush|brush]].  \n| Fold the foil over so you have a sealed parcel.\n| Wrap in the second sheet of [[Foil|foil]] and put back in the [[roasting tray]] for a further hour.\n| After the hour in the foil parcel, increase the heat to 140\u00b0 C (257\u00b0 F - gas 1), fold back the foil roast the ribs, uncovered and [[Roast|roast]] for another 40 minutes, basting often with the syrupy marinade.\n| Remove and rest for at least 15 minutes before serving.\n}}\n\n===Chef's notes===\nI've found it difficult to obtain [[beef short ribs]] from anywhere but a specialist butchers and even then, they needed to be ordered in advance.  Today, I was delighted to discover [[F. Conisbee specialist butchers]] had them in stock. 4 [[Argentine ribs]] for \u00a321.04.  Robert cut them in half again lengthwise with the bandsaw. One of these half-ribs per person is plenty!\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Beef recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:North American recipes]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#beefshortribs #barbecuebeefshortribs #marinade #roast #argentineribs #roastingtray #porkspareribs #butter #ribs #oliveoil #chillipowder </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
