Leaving it whole makes it easier to remove and discard at the end of the cooking process.\n| Cut the pork belly into into 2.5cm (1\") chunks and stir into the [[Beans|beans]]\n| Push the cloves into one of the onion pieces or into a [[muslin]] bag so they can be easily retrieved\n| [[Salt]] aside, mix the remaining ingredients into a few cups of the liquor and add to the [[Beans|beans]]\n| If required, top up with hot water so the beans are barely covered\n| Cover with the lid and [[Bake|bake]] for 3 hours\n| After 3 hours remove the lid add a little more liquor if needed, bring the [[Pork|pork]] chunks to the surface, increase the oven temperature to 180\u00b0C (350\u00b0F, Gas 4) and [[Bake|bake]] uncovered for 1 to 1.5 hours, checking every 15 minutes until it reaches your desired consistency.\n| remove the large onion pieces and the [[cloves]] and discard the pork rind.\n| Season to taste with [[Salt|salt]] or [[soy sauce]]\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe with crusty [[Bread|bread]] or as an [[Accompaniment|accompaniment]] to [[Barbecued|barbecued]] [[Meats|meats]].\n===Chef's notes===\nThese will keep for a few weeks if [[Refrigerated|refrigerated]] in a [[Lock & Lock box]].\n===Variations===\nProbably not authentic but I added a little [[dark soy sauce]] and some [[chili sauce]] when adjusting the final seasoning.\n==See also==\n* [[Chilli beans]]\n* http://www.deliaonline.com/recipes/cuisine/exotic/american/boston-baked-beans.html\n* http://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/bostonbakedbeans_10471\n* http://www.channel4.com/4food/recipes/tv-show-recipes/the-fabulous-baker-brothers-recipes/baker-brother-beans-recipe\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Accompaniments]]\n[[Category:Barbecue recipes]]\n[[Category:Grain and bean recipes]]\n[[Category:North American recipes]]\n[[Category:Snacks and light bites]]\n[[Category:Boiled or simmered]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#bostonbakedbeans #beans #porkbelly #bake #muscovadosugar #muslin #chillibeans #mustardpowder #darksoysauce #molasses #haricotbeans </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
