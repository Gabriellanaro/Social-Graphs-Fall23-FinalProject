Add [[Chicken]] [[Broth]], the quartered [[Onion]] , three chopped [[Celery]] [[Stocks|stocks]], three chopped [[Carrots]] and 2 teaspoons [[Salt|salt]]. Bring to a [[Boil|boil]]. Reduce heat to a [[Simmer|simmer]], cook covered for one hour.\n| Remove the cooked [[Chicken|chicken]] to cool.  Strain the [[Broth|broth]] and discard the solids, at this point the [[Onion|onion]]/[[Celery|celery]]/[[Carrots|carrots]] have given up all of their flavour in the [[Broth|broth]].  When the [[Chicken|chicken]] is cool, debone and shred the chicken.\n| Add the two finely [[Diced|diced]] [[Carrots|carrots]], two finely [[Diced|diced]] [[Celery|celery]] [[Stocks|stocks]] and the finely diced [[Onion|onion]] back to the [[Strained|strained]] [[Broth|broth]].  Cook [[Broth|broth]] at a low [[Simmer|simmer]] for 30 minutes.\n}}\n'''[[Dumplings]]'''\n{{RecipeMethod\n| While the [[Broth|broth]] is [[Simmering|simmering]], in a bowl, combine the [[Flour|flour]], [[Baking soda|baking soda]], and [[Salt|salt]]. Cut in the [[Shortening|shortening]]. Add the [[Buttermilk|buttermilk]], stirring with a fork until moistened.  [[Knead]] the [[Dough|dough]] 4 to 5 times, and stop.  Do not over work the [[Dough|dough]]!  You are not making [[Bread|bread]].  Over worked dough makes tough [[Dumplings|dumplings]].  The dough should be loose and sticky.\n| You\u0092ll need a [[Rolling pin|rolling pin]] and something to cut the [[Dumplings|dumplings]] with. I like to use a [[Pastry|pastry]] cutter, but a sharp knife works also. I also use a spatula/turner to lift the [[Dumplings|dumplings]] off the cutting surface.\n| On a heavily [[Flour|flour]]ed work surface, roll the [[Dough|dough]] out thin, about &#8539;&#8243; thick with a [[Flour|flour]]ed [[Rolling pin|rolling pin]]. [[Dip]] your cutter in flour and cut the [[Dumplings|dumplings]] in to strips about \u00bd&#8243; x 2&#8243;. It\u0092s okay for them not to be exact. Just eye ball it. Some will be bigger, some smaller, some shaped funny.\n| Use the floured spatula/turner to put them on a heavily floured plate. Just keep flouring between the layers of [[Dumplings|dumplings]]. \n| To cook the [[Dumplings|dumplings]], bring the [[Broth|broth]] to a [[Boil|boil]]. Drop the [[Dumplings|dumplings]] in a few at a time, stirring while you add them. The extra [[Flour|flour]] on them will [[Help|help]] thicken the [[Broth|broth]]. Cook the dumplings for about 15-20 minutes. Stir in the [[Black pepper|black pepper]] and cooked [[Chicken|chicken]], and then serve.\n}}\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes|Chicken]]\n[[Category:North American recipes]]\n[[Category:Poultry recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:Stewed, braised or pot roasted|Chicken]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#dumplings #broth #chicken #flour #diced #celery #carrots #chickenanddumplings #onion #dough #rollingpin </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
