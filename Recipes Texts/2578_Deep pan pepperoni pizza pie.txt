Quite a good recipe to try if you want to impress.  With a side-salad it will easily serve 4 people.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 1 200 g [[pepperoni]]-style sausage, peel off the skin and thinly slice the sausage. [[Chorizo]] works equally well in this recipe\n| 1 portion of [[Pizza dough|pizza dough]]\n| [[Fine yellow cornmeal|Fine yellow cornmeal]] or [[plain flour]] for dusting .''Students, you can get by without this!''\n| 110 g (4 oz) [[Cheddar cheese]], [[Grated|grated]]\n| 1 large can of chopped peeled [[Tomatoes|tomatoes]], left to drain over a coarse sieve for 20 minutes\n| 1 teaspoon [[dried oregano]]\n| 1/2 a teaspoon [[dried oregano]] or [[mixed herbs]]\n| Pinch of [[Black pepper|black pepper]]\n| 1 ball of [[Buffalo|buffalo]] [[Mozzarella|mozzarella]], torn\n}}\n\n===How to ensure a crispy base===\nHaving made these deep pan pizzas many, many times, I've found that sometimes it's hard to get the base well cooked without burning the rest of the [[pizza dough]].  I've found the best way is to use a meta-based pan, similar to a baking tray.  The metal base gets hot enough to crisp the base properly.  I have a really heavy rectangular Le Creuset baking tray that is absolutely ideal.  It seems a shame as it will mean I'll never use my earthenware deep pan pizza dish again!\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Deep pan pepperoni pizza pie.jpg|Ready to eat\nImage:Deep pan pepperoni pizza pie topped.jpg|Topped with mozzarella and tomatoes\nImage:Deep pan pepperoni pizza pie filled.jpg|Pepperoni & cheddar\nImage:Easy tomato topping for pizza recipe.jpg|[[Drained tomato topping]]\n</gallery>\n\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n* Preheat the [[Oven|oven]] to 190\u00b0 C (375\u00b0 F - gas 5), [fan oven 170\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]\n* Make the [[Dough|dough]] as instructed\n* [[Easy tomato topping for pizza|Drain the canned tomatoes]]\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| [[Easy tomato topping for pizza|Drain the canned tomatoes]], add the herbs and season with salt and pepper\n| [[Spray]] or oil a deep pan pizza dish or a small oven tray\n| Roll out 2/3rds of the [[Dough|dough]] to about 3mm and line a pan so the [[Dough|dough]] just  overlaps the edges and trim any excess.\n| ''Students: a wine bottle, beer bottle or even beer-can makes a good substitute for a [[rolling pin]]!''\n| Sprinkle the base with the [[Cheddar cheese]] and the sliced [[pepperoni]]\n| Roll out the remaining [[Dough|dough]] to make a lid\n| Wet the edge of the dough so you can make a good seal\n| Pinch the lid on and roll the edge over so it joins the base\n| This time I'm not making any holes in the lid so it should puff up - might be fun!\n| Top with the torn [[mozzarella]] and then dab on the tomato topping\n| If you have enough spare time leave in a [[warm place]] for an hour or so to let it rise first. \n| [[Bake]] for 45 minutes, resting a sheet of [[Tin-foil|tin-foil]] on top of the [[Pizza|pizza]] towards the end if it looks as though it might start to burn.\n| Allow to cool for 5 minutes before slicing and serving\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe with a [[Green salad|green salad]]\n===Variations===\nAdd whatever you fancy, just don't add too much topping or let it get too wet of it could end up rather soggy.\n\nFinely grated [[parmesan cheese]] sprinkled on the top gives a nice toasty crust.\n==See also==\n* [[Chicago deep pan pizza]]\n* www.ibelieveicanfry.com/2012/01/chicago-stuffed-pizza.html Julia's Chicago pizza recipe\n* [[:Category:I believe I can fry recipes|Julia's recipes on Cookipedia]]\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes|Pizza]]\n[[Category:Cookery cheats|Pizza]]\n[[Category:Student recipes|Pizza]]\n[[Category:North American recipes|Pizza]]\n[[Category:Bread and baking|Pizza]]\n[[Category:Main courses|Pizza]]\n[[Category:Pizza recipes|Pizza]]\n[[Category:I believe I can fry recipes|Pizza]]\n[[Category:Recipes from other sites|Pizza]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted|Pizza]]\n\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#deeppanpepperonipizzapie #dough #pepperoni #driedoregano #mozzarella #cheddarcheese #pizzadough #parmesancheese #tomatoes #grated #warmplace </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
