Perhaps this picture will remind me next time!]]\nThis in now becoming an obsession - I'm now up to two a day (making quiches, not eating them!)\n\nI love Frankfurters and quiches, so I thought I would combine the two.\n\nThe quantity used makes two quiches, but you could obviously halve the amounts if you only wanted to make one.\n\nI guess the obvious thing to include would be [[Mustard|mustard]], but I wasn't too sure about that so used my favourite instead - [[Louisiana Hot Pepper Sauce|Louisiana hot pepper sauce]] - use [[Tabasco sauce]] if you wish.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 500 g (1 lb 2 oz) pack of [[ready made shortcrust pastry]]\n| 350 g [[Frankfurters]] 1 pack, 10 in my packet\n| 6 [[Free range eggs|free range eggs]]\n| 6 tablespoons of [[Greek-style yogurt]]\n| 3 tablespoons of [[Mascarpone cheese|mascarpone cheese]]\n| Splash of [[Louisiana hot pepper sauce]]\n| 1 tablespoon of freshly chopped [[Parsley|parsley]]\n| Grind of [[Black pepper|black pepper]]\n| Pinch of [[Sea Salt|sea salt]]\n| Splash of [[Milk|milk]]\n| 2 large [[Tomatoes|tomatoes]], sliced\n\n}}\n\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n* Preheat the oven to 200\u00b0 C (400\u00b0 F - Gas 6) \n\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Roll the pastry out into two circles to fit your flan trays. [[Push-out flan dishes]] are the best for this I find (as long as your pastry doesn't leak)\n| Blind [[Bake|bake]] the pastry for 10 minutes\n| Add the [[Eggs|eggs]], [[Cheese|cheese]], [[Yogurt|yogurt]] and a splash of [[Milk|milk]] to a bowl, season with [[Salt|salt]], [[Pepper|pepper]] and your hot [[Sauce|sauce]]\n| Whisk up the mixture so the [[Cheese|cheese]] and [[Yogurt|yogurt]] is well combined\n| Cut the [[Frankfurters]] in half and arrange in the dishes\n| Sprinkle the [[Parsley|parsley]] into the mixture\n| Divide the [[Egg|egg]] mixture between the two trays and top with sliced tomatoes\n| Reduce the heat of the oven to 180\u00b0 C (350\u00b0 F - Gas 4)\n| [[Bake]] for a further 40 minutes, leaving a little head-room as they tend to rise a bit - like a souffle\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\n\nServe hot or cold\n\n{{Quiche - See also}}\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Cheese recipes]]\n[[Category:Egg recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:North American recipes]]\n[[Category:Pies tarts and flans]]\n[[Category:Starters]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#frankfurterquiche #cheese #parsley #yogurt #frankfurters #bake #miseenplace #tabascosauce #mascarponecheese #freerangeeggs #sauce </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
