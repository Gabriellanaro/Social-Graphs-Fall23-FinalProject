They are [[Baked|baked]] rather than [[Fried|fried]] so are possibly slightly healthy!\n\nThe recipe idea and the pictures come by courtesy of '[[I believe I can fry]]' and this was the first recipe I chose from her collection after she gave us permission to share her ideas.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 2 Russet [[Potatoes|potatoes]], peeled and cut into thin fries\n| A good splash of [[Olive oil|olive oil]]\n| &#188; teaspoon [[Garlic powder|garlic powder]]\n| 1 teaspoon [[Rosemary leaves|rosemary leaves]], finely chopped.\n| The original recipe specified [[Dried|dried]] [[Rosemary|rosemary]], I tend to use fresh rosemary as I have so much of it.  In a recipe like this it probably doesn't hurt to throw a few [[Rosemary#Sprigs of rosemary|sprigs]] onto the [[Baking tray|baking tray]] just for the aroma, Jamie Oliver style.\n| [[Sea Salt|sea salt]]\n| [[Black pepper]]\n\n}}\n\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n* Preheat the [[Oven|oven]] to 230\u00b0 C (450\u00b0 F - gas 8), [fan oven 210\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]\n* Soak the thin cut fries in cold water for 10 minutes\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Rinse and drain the chipped fries and pat dry on paper towels.\n| Add the [[Rosemary leaves|rosemary leaves]] and [[Garlic powder|garlic powder]] and [[Black pepper|black pepper]] to the [[Oil|oil]] and mix well, a [[Pestle and mortar|pestle and mortar]] will bring out the flavour of fresh [[Rosemary|rosemary]] leaves.\n| Add the [[Oil|oil]] and [[Potatoes|potatoes]] to a large [[Lock & Lock|lock & lock]]-style box, close the lid and shake well to coat the fries.\n| Spread the fries evenly on a [[Foil|foil]]-lined [[Roasting tray|roasting tray]].\n| [[Bake]] for 30 minutes turning a few times.\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe immediately, seasoned with [[Sea Salt|sea salt]].\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:North American recipes]]\n[[Category:Accompaniments]]\n[[Category:Snacks and light bites]]\n[[Category:Vegan recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes]]\n[[Category:Garlic recipes]]\n[[Category:Potato recipes]]\n[[Category:I believe I can fry recipes]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#rosemary #garlicandrosemarythinbakedfries #blackpepper #garlicpowder #rosemaryleaves #potatoes #garlic #snack #unusualrecipes #dried #foil </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
