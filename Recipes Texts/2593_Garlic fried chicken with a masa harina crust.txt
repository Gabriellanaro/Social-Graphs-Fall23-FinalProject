Reading one of Ken Hom's early cookbooks gave me the impetus to try it again.  I'm glad I did, it was really good and not at all greasy.\n\nThis is really an aide-memoir for me; next time I would add a tablespoon of [[Old India Taco Seasoning]] for a bit more [[Spice|spice]], and I would also hammer the [[Chicken|chicken]] flat before slicing up.  This would enable less [[Oil|oil]] to be used (not so wasteful), and it would also give a shorter, more uniform cooking time. As it was, we had to cook all of the chicken pieces a little longer to be sure the largest pieces were properly cooked.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| 400g small [[Chicken|chicken]] fillets\n| 1 tablespoon [[Lemon juice|lemon juice]]\n| 1 tablespoon [[Shaoxing rice wine|shaoxing rice wine]] [[Vinegar|vinegar]] - [[Balsamic vinegar|balsamic vinegar]] will be fine \n| 3 [[Cloves of Garlic, peeled and crushed|cloves of garlic, peeled and crushed]]\n| A pinch of [[Salt|salt]] and [[Black pepper|black pepper]]\n| 2 [[Egg whites|egg whites]]\n| 2 tablespoons of [[Cornflour|cornflour]]\n| 1 [[Cup|cup]] [[Masa Harina|masa harina]]\n| 1 to 2 cups [[Sunflower oil|sunflower oil]]\n}}\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n\n* Cut the [[Chicken|chicken]] fillets into bite-sized pieces\n* Add to a [[Lock & Lock box]] together with the [[Crushed garlic|crushed garlic]], [[Rice|rice]] [[Wine vinegar|wine vinegar]], [[Lemon juice|lemon juice]], [[Salt|salt]] and [[Black pepper|black pepper]].\n* Shake well to mix and [[Refrigerate|refrigerate]] for an hour or more to allow the [[Marinade|marinade]] to penetrate the [[Meat|meat]].\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Garlic fried chicken with a masa harina crust frying.jpg|Frying in a wok\nImage:Chicken coated with masa.jpg|Coated with masa harina after the egg-white and cornflour stage\nImage:Garlic fried chicken marinading.jpg|Marinade for an hour or more\n</gallery>\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| Drain the [[Chicken|chicken]] pieces in a [[Colander|colander]] and discard the [[Marinade|marinade]] juices.\n| Whisk the [[Egg whites|egg whites]] and [[Cornflour|cornflour]] in a bowl.\n| Add the [[Chicken|chicken]] pieces to the bowl and mix well.
