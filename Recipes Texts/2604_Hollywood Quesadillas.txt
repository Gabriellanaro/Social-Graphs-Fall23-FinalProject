The concept is simple, the ingredients simpler.I have enhanced the 'bar food' version, as I learned they could be more complete and more satisfying. Serve for snacks or a [[Light lunch|light lunch]]. Think of [[Quesadillas|quesadillas]] as [[Tex-Mex]] [[Pizza|pizza]].\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 4 [[Flour tortillas|flour tortillas]] (10\"-12\")\n| 6 oz. [[Grated|grated]] [[Monterey Jack cheese]]\n| 1/3 cup fresh green or red [[Jalapeno|jalapeno]] [[Peppers|peppers]],  seeded and membraned, then [[Diced|diced]] fine\n| &frac12; cup [[Diced|diced]] [[Spanish]] (Yellow) [[Onion|onion]], fine diced\n| 3 tablespoons [[Tomato salsa|tomato salsa]] ( or more) you choose the [[Salsa|salsa]]-I make my own)\n| Chopped [[Cilantro]] (opt.)\n| &frac12; teaspoon [[Ground cumin|ground cumin]] (opt.)\n\n}}\n\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n* Have everything at or close to room temperature and a large [[Fry|fry]] pan!\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Spread all ingredients ( except [[Cheese|cheese]])with the back of a large spoon on [[Tortilla|tortilla]] one. Set [[Grill|grill]].hob to medium low..\n| Sprinkle [[Cheese|cheese]] over [[Tomato|tomato]] [[Pepper|pepper]] [[Salsa|salsa]]. Place second [[Tortilla|tortilla]] over top. slide this into the pan, and [[Steam|steam]] by using pan cover, or not if you want a more brittle version of [[Quesadillas|quesadillas]]. After about 5 minutes, flip the [[Quesadilla|quesadilla]] to [[Brown|brown]] tortilla 2. When it is all sizzling (3 minutes), transfer to cutting board and slice in [[Wedges|wedges]], as you would a [[Pizza|pizza]] or [[Cheesecake|cheesecake]], 3  or 4 to a plate.\n| This recipe can be multiplied for extra appetisers. Remember: you can put in refritos, [[Steamed|steamed]] [[Corn|corn]], chopped [[Olives|olives]]...but this is the core recipe.\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe with a good light 'cervesa' ([[Beer|beer]]) and lots of paper towels\n===Variations===\nChange [[Cheeses|cheeses]]. Medium Cheddars, Canadian Brick [[Cheese]] or Colby  also work well. You can also use chopped jarred [[Jalapenos|jalapenos]] or others, but it isn't fresh anymore. Canned jalapenos are milder, usually, then their fresh ancestors.\n===Chef's notes===\nOnly the [[Tortillas|tortillas]], [[Peppers|peppers]] and [[Cheese|cheese]] are constants.\n\nI found these difficult to flip, without emptying the contents all over the hob.  If you feel doubtful, use two plates to flip the quesadillas: Lay one over the pan, flip both over, place a second plate over the first, invert those, remove the top plate, replace with the pan, invert those, remove the plate.  ''If you can do a better job of explaining this, please do.''\n\nRecipe contributed by [[User:Tetramariner|Tetramariner]] 15:28, 30 January 2010 (GMT)\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Latin American recipes]]\n[[Category:Snacks and light bites]]\n[[Category:Spicy recipes]]\n[[Category:Tex-Mex recipes]]\n[[Category:North American recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes]]\n[[Category:Pan fried]]\n\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#cheese #hollywoodquesadillas #diced #tortilla #salsa #pizza #quesadillas #peppers #jalapenos #tortillas #miseenplace </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
