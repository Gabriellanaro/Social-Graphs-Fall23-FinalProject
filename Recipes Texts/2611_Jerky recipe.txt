The result is a salty, stripped, semi-sweet snack that can be stored without [[refrigeration]]. Jerky is an early application of food preservation techniques.\n===Preparation===\nAny single preparation, or recipe for jerky typically uses only one type of meat. Of the many types of meat that may be used, [[beef]] is the most common. Meat from other animals\u2014such as wild game, [[venison]], elk, caribou and moose\u2014is also used. Recently, other meats have come to market, such as [[turkey]], [[ostrich]], [[salmon]], alligator, and [[tuna]]. The meat must be dried quickly, to limit bacterial growth during the critical period where the meat is not yet dry. To do this, the meat is thinly sliced, or pressed thinly, in the case of ground meat. Drying is performed at low temperatures, to avoid cooking or over drying the meat and making it brittle.\n===Space jerky===\nSince 1996, jerky has been selected by astronauts several times for space flight due to its light weight and high level of nutrition.\n[[Image:Space jerky.jpg|300px|thumb|right|Jerky on International Space Station with Earth visible through the window. Carried to ISS aboard STS-118, Endevour Space Shuttle flight]]\n[[Jerky]] can be made from almost any lean [[Meat|meat]], with [[Beef|beef]] or [[Venison|venison]] being the best. If made from [[Pork|pork]] the [[Meat|meat]] must be treated to kill the trichinella parasite before it is sliced and [[Marinated|marinated]]. This parasite could cause trichinosis. To treat the [[Pork|pork]], [[Freeze|freeze]] a portion that is 15cm or less thick at -15\u00b0C or lower for 20 days. [[Poultry]] is not recommended for [[Jerky|jerky]], because of its texture when raw.\n===Recipe preparation===\nThe [[Meat|meat]] is [[Marinated|marinated]] for both flavour and tenderness. Ingredients for [[Marinades|marinades]] include [[Oil|oil]], [[Salt|salt]] and an acid product such as [[Vinegar|vinegar]], [[Lemon juice|lemon juice]], [[Teriyaki|teriyaki]], [[Soy sauce|soy sauce]] or [[Wine|wine]].\nThe first step in preparing the [[Meat|meat]] is to slice it into long, thin strips. Trim and discard all the [[Fat|fat]] from the [[Meat|meat]], because it becomes rancid rapidly Partially [[Freezing|freezing]] the [[Meat|meat]] before cutting makes it easier to slice evenly Slice with the [[Grain|grain]] into thin strips approximately 6mm thick if a chewy [[Jerky|jerky]] is desired. Slice across the grain for a more tender, brittle [[Jerky|jerky]] A tenderiser can also be used on the meat. \n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 750g of lean [[Meat|meat]], prepared as above\n| &frac14; teaspoon each of [[Pepper|pepper]] and [[Garlic powder|garlic powder]]\n| &frac12; teaspoon [[Onion|onion]] powder\n| 1 teaspoon hickory smoke-flavoured [[Salt|salt]]\n| 60ml [[Soy sauce|soy sauce]]\n| 1 tablespoon [[Worcestershire sauce]]\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| Combine all ingredients. \n| Place strips of [[Meat|meat]] in a bowl and cover with the [[Marinade|marinade]]. \n| Cover and [[Refrigerate|refrigerate]] 1-2 hours or overnight.\n| Remove [[Meat|meat]] strips from the [[Marinade|marinade]], drain on absorbent towelling and arrange on dehydrator trays. Place the slices close together but do not overlap. \n| Place the trays in the dehydrator preheated at 70\u00b0C.\n| Dry until a test piece cracks but does not break when it is bent (6-10 hours). \n| Pat off any [[Oil|oil]] with absorbent towelling and cool. Remove strips from the racks. \n| Allow to cool and package in [[Glass|glass]] jars or heavy plastic bags.\n}}\n\n===Servings===\n300g to 450g of Jerky\n===Chef's notes===\nProperly [[Dried|dried]] [[Jerky|jerky]] will keep at room temperature 1 to 2 months in a sealed container. However, to increase the shelf life and maintain the flavour, [[Refrigerate|refrigerate]] or [[Freeze|freeze]].\n\nFollow the [[RSPCA Think Pig Checklist]] to make sure that your [[Pork|pork]] has come from pigs that have been reared to higher welfare standards.\n\n* http://bit.ly/rspcathinkpig\n\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:North American recipes]]\n[[Category:Snacks and light bites]]\n[[Category:Beef recipes]]\n[[Category:Game recipes]]\n[[Category:Lamb recipes]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:Pork recipes]]\n[[Category:Veal recipes]]\n[[Category:Ingredients]]\n[[Category:Prepared foods]]\n[[Category:Dehydrated]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#jerky #pork #marinated #freeze #beef #jerkyrecipe #refrigerate #fat #venison #soysauce #marinade </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
