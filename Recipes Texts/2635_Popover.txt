A light, hollow roll  made from an [[Egg|egg]] [[Batter|batter]] similar to that used in making [[Yorkshire pudding]]. The name \"popover\" comes from the fact that the batter swells or \"pops\" over the top of the [[Muffin|muffin]] tin while [[Baking|baking]]. They can also be [[Baked|baked]] in individual [[Custard|custard]] cups.\n[[Image:Popover.jpg|thumb|300px|right|'''Nordic Ware popover tin''']]\n\nThese are best server directly from the [[Oven|oven]].  For authentic popovers, use a large [[Muffin|muffin]] tray rather than a [[Yorkshire pudding]] tray.\n\nRecently whilst reading John Steinbeck's ''Sweet Thursday'', I noticed a reference to '''popovers''' and wondered what they were: \n\n''Joe Elegant was a pale young man with bangs. He smoked foreign cigarettes in a long ebony holder and he cooked for the Bear Flag. The girls said he made the best '''popovers''' in the world, and he could give a massage that would shake the kinks out of a Saturday night when the fleet was in.''\n\n..hence this page.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 1 cup [[Milk|milk]]\n| 3 whole [[Eggs|eggs]], lightly beaten\n| 1 cup [[Plain flour|plain flour]], sifted\n| Large pinch of [[Salt|salt]]\n\n}}\n\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n* Preheat the [[Oven|oven]] to 200\u00b0 C (400\u00b0 F - gas 6)\n* Allow the [[Milk|milk]] to get to room temperature\n* Sift the [[Flour|flour]]\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Add the ingredients to a [[Food-processor|food-processor]] with a metal blade, in the following order:\n| [[Milk]]\n| [[Eggs]]\n| [[Flour]]\n| [[Salt]]\n| Pulse blend for about 35 seconds\n| Pour in to a well buttered [[Popover tray|popover]] or [[Muffin tray]]\n| [[Bake]] for 20 minutes at 200\u00b0 C (400\u00b0 F - gas 6)\n| Reduce the heat to 180\u00b0 C (350\u00b0 F - gas 4) and [[Bake|bake]] for a further 10 minutes\n| Remove from the [[Oven|oven]] and serve immediately\n}}\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Accompaniments]]\n[[Category:Bread and baking]]\n[[Category:Egg recipes]]\n[[Category:Historic recipes]]\n[[Category:North American recipes]]\n[[Category:Snacks and light bites]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#popover #yorkshirepudding #muffin #flour #eggs #bake #custard #baked #batter #baking #plainflour </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
