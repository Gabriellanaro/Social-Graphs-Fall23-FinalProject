It sounds very strange but the combination worked brilliantly.  The sauce is based on [[Mushrooms in a cucumber sauce|mushrooms in a cucumber sauce]], with added [[double cream]].  The [[London broil]] marinade was just a rather successful experiment. Although [[London broil]] is usually associated with beef, this worked really well with a pork fillet - even better because it was barbecued, creating a smoky, crisp finish, but remaining tender inside.\n\n\n'''Mushroom and cucumber sauce'''\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| A good grind of [[Black pepper|black pepper]]\n| 50g [2 oz] [[Butter|butter]]\n| 110 g [4 oz] of oyster [[Mushrooms|mushrooms]], wiped clean and chopped\n| 1 tablespoon [15 ml] [[Plain flour|plain flour]]\n| Half a [[Cucumber|cucumber]], de-seeded, peeled and cubed\n| 150 ml [1/4 pint] hot [[Vegetable Stock|vegetable stock]]\n| 1 teaspoon [[Dried|dried]] [[Dill|dill]]\n| [[Sea Salt|sea salt]] to taste\n| 150 ml [[double cream]]\n}}\n'''London broil pork fillet'''\n{{RecipeIngredientsNB\n| 300g [[Pork tenderloin fillet]], sliced into 2 pieces lengthways\n| 4 tablespoons of orange juice\n| 2 tablespoons of [[dark soy sauce]]\n| 2 tablespoons of [[light soy sauce]]\n| 2 tablespoons of [[Worcestershire sauce]]\n| 2 tablespoons of [[sherry vinegar]]\n| Pinch of [[black pepper]]\n| Pinch of [[chilli powder]]\n}}\n\n===[[Mise en place]]===\nAdd the pork fillet and the marinade ingredients to a [[Lock and Lock]] box, close the lid and shake well to coat evenly.
