I've added 150 ml of [[cider]] and the flesh of 1 [[orange]], otherwise it's the same.\n\nLots of recipes suggest adding a tablespoon of [[liquid smoke]] over the meat at the final stage.  I prefer to leave chemicals like that in the garage!  However, if you have your own [[Smoking food|smoker]], I would smoke it for an hour or so before you start the cooking process.\n\nIf you like this, you will also love [[Cochinita pibil]] and [[Beer pickled belly of pork]]!\n\nNote: This recipe needs to be prepared 24 hours in advance.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 1.3 kg (3 lb) boneless [[pork shoulder]].\n| 2 level teaspoons [[Sea Salt|sea salt]]\n| 3 tablespoons [[Brown sugar|brown sugar]]\n| 2 tablespoons [[Paprika|paprika]] - [[smoked paprika]] if you have it.\n| 1 teaspoon [[Cinnamon|cinnamon]] powder, freshly ground if possible - see ''Chef's notes''\n| 2 teaspoons [[Mustard powder|mustard powder]]\n| 1/2 a teaspoon of [[Peppercorns|peppercorns]], [[Ground|ground]] to a powder in a [[Coffee grinder|coffee grinder]]\n| 2 teaspoons [[Chilli powder|chilli powder]] or a bunch of your favourite [[Dried|dried]] [[Chillies|chillies]], powdered\n| 2 teaspoons [[coriander seeds]], [[Ground|ground]] to a powder\n| 2 teaspoons [[Garlic powder|garlic powder]]\n| 1 teaspoon [[Ginger powder|ginger powder]] \n| 250 ml [[cider]]\n| 1 [[orange]], peeled, and roughly chopped\n}}\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Pulled pork slow cooker recipe.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Use a [[Lock and Lock]] box to mix the ingredients and marinade the pork\nImage:Spice mix for pulled pork.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Spice mix for pulled pork\n</gallery>\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n*If you are lucky enough to have a [[Smoking food|smoker]], smoke the joint for an hour or so.\n*Mix all of the [[Spices|spices]] together in a large [[baking tray]].\n*Remove and discard the rind.\n*Make random slashes in the [[Meat|meat]].\n* Add all of the remaining ingredients to a large [[Lock and Lock box]] together with the pork joint.  Replace the lid and shake like mad for a minute to mix the ingredients.\n*[[Refrigerate|refrigerate]] for 24 hours or so, shaking the box now and then.\n\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Add the contents of the [[Lock and Lock]] box to your [[slow cooker]].\n| Cover and slow cook on medium for 8 hours - it will be good to go after 4, but really disintegrates nicely the longer you cook it.  If you are able, you could reduce to low after 4 hours too.\n| Remove the cooked pork from the slow cooker and drain and reserve the juices and return the meat to the [[slow cooker]] to keep warm.\n| Using a frying pan over a medium heat, boil the juices and reduce by about 50%, stirring now and then.  This should take about 5 minutes.\n| Pour the reduction over the cooked pork, remove from the slow cooker and use two forks to shred the pork into tiny pieces.\n| Serve immediately.\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe with chopped salad vegetables in [[pitta breads]].\n\n===Chef's notes===\nThe spices in this are not an exact science. If you don't have a certain spice, use something else.  Look at the individual spice links on this page or our main [[:Category:Spices|spice category]] to find similar spices that you may have instead.  If you favour a certain flavour, add more of it. Mess around, be bold!!\n\nIn this recipe we are [[marinating]] the pork in the [[cider]], rather than as a dry rub so you could just as easily add 3 or 4 peeled and crushed [[cloves of garlic]] instead of the [[garlic powder]] and a thumb-sized piece of [[ginger root]], peeled and grated, instead of the [[ginger powder]].\n\n{{Template:PeelingGinger}}\n{{Template:See-also-pulled-pork}}\n[[Category:Smoked]]\n[[Category:Smoker recipes]]\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Cooking with beer]]\n[[Category:Chilli pepper recipes]]\n[[Category:Barbecue recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:Pork recipes]]\n[[Category:North American recipes]]\n[[Category:Spicy recipes]]\n[[Category:Favourite recipes]]\n[[Category:Marinaded]]\n[[Category:Slow cooked]]\n[[Category:Slow cooker recipes]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#slowcooker #cider #lockandlock #gingerpowder #ground #orange #smokingfood #garlicpowder #mustardpowder #barbecue #brownsugar </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
