Contradictory lore suggests that the Original Sloppy Joe [[Sandwich]] was invented at Sloppy Joe's Bar in Key West, Florida, or by a cook named Joe at a cafe in Sioux City, Iowa, as a variation of the popular \"loose meat\" sandwich (which does not contain [[Tomato|tomato]] [[Sauce|sauce]]).\n\nThere are numerous variations of this recipe, this is my favourite.  I add lots more [[chilli]] so it becomes [[chilli con carne]] in a roll.\n===Other names===\nSloppy joes can also referred to as:\n* ''Yip Yips'' in Southern Illinois near St Louis. \n* ''Yum Yums'' in parts of the Midwest USA, particularly in Nebraska\n* ''Wimpies'' in parts of the Northeast USA, especially Northeastern Pennsylvania\n* ''Slushburgers'' in parts of the Upper Midwest, particularly in Eastern Montana and Western North Dakota\n* ''Barbecues'' in other areas of the Upper Midwest, and also in some parts of Southeastern Pennsylvania.\n* ''Taverns'' in parts of northwest Iowa and Minnesota.\n* ''Sloppy Janes'' in parts of central Minnesota.\n* '' Steamers'' in parts of Virginia, West Virginia, and Maryland.\n* ''Gulash'' (not to be confused with [[Goulash]]) in parts of the Upper Midwest.\n* ''Dynamites'' in northern Rhode Island.\n* ''Manwich'' in parts of Northern New Jersey, after the popular name brand sauce, as a distinction from the local variant also known as a \"sloppy joe\"\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 1 tablespoon [[Olive oil|olive oil]] for [[Frying|frying]]\n| 450 g (1 lb) [[Minced beef|minced beef]]\n| 1 [[Onion|onion]], chopped\n| 1 small [[Sweet pepper|sweet pepper]], chopped\n| 4 tablespoons of [[Tomato|tomato]] pur\u00e9e\n| 1 tablespoon [[Worcestershire sauce]]\n| 142 ml (&frac14; pint) water\n| 2 [[Cloves garlic, peeled and crushed|cloves garlic, peeled and crushed]]\n| 1 teaspoon [[Dried oregano|dried oregano]]\n| &#189; teaspoon [[Chilli powder|chilli powder]]\n| &#189; teaspoon [[Paprika powder|paprika powder]]\n| 1 tablespoon [[Brown sugar|brown sugar]]\n| &#189; teaspoon [[Ground cumin|ground cumin]]\n| &#189; teaspoon [[Cider vinegar|cider vinegar]]\n| [[Sea Salt|sea salt]] and [[Freshly ground black pepper|freshly ground black pepper]] to taste\n}}\n'''to serve:'''\n* 4 [[Bread rolls|bread rolls]], halved\n\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Heat the [[Oil|oil]] in a large [[Frying pan|frying pan]] or [[Wok|wok]] to medium/high and [[Brown|brown]] the [[Minced beef|minced beef]] for 5 minutes.\n| Lower the heat to medium, add the [[Peppers|peppers]], [[Onions|onions]] and [[Garlic|garlic]] and [[Stir-fry|stir-fry]] for a further 5 minutes.
