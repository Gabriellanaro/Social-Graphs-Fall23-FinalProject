[[Short ribs]] are probably much better suited to [[Slow cooking|slow cooking]] (''[[Beef short ribs (slow cooker recipe)]]'') than sous vide cooking as they need prolonged cooking to break down the [[Fats|fats]] and collagen to make them palatable.  10 hours in the [[Slow cooker|slow cooker]] is just about right from the experiments I've done.  Anyway, to my thinking, the benefits of sous vide cooking in a sealed pouch would be in  concentrating the [[Marinade|marinade]] flavours.\n[[Image:Vacuum large bag vertical.jpg|300px|thumb|right|An oversized bag hung vertically lessens the chance of liquid being sucked into the sealer]]\n\nIn the end the results were very good, but no better than [[Slow cooking|slow cooking]] the [[Short ribs|short ribs]].\n\nI cooked the [[Short ribs|short ribs]] in the [[Marinade|marinade]] for 24 hours at 75\u00b0C(''167\u00b0F'')\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| 800g rack of halved beef [[Short ribs|short ribs]] containing 2 [[Ribs|ribs]]\n}}\n'''[[Marinade|marinade]]'''\n{{RecipeIngredientsNB\n| 1 teaspoon [[Chilli powder|chilli powder]]\n| 1 teaspoon [[Sea Salt|sea salt]]\n| 1 teaspoon [[Ground black pepper|ground black pepper]]\n| 2 tablespoons [[Tomato puree|tomato puree]]\n| 1 teaspoon [[Dried|dried]] [[Parsley|parsley]]\n| 1 tablespoon Heinz [[Tomato sauce|tomato sauce]]\n| 1 teaspoon [[Mustard powder|mustard powder]]\n| 1 square of Bournville [[Chocolate|chocolate]]\n| 2 tablespoons of [[Muscovado sugar|muscovado sugar]]\n| 50 ml ruby [[Port|port]]\n}}\n\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| Mix the [[Marinade|marinade]] ingredients together (I microwaved them for a minute just to melt the [[Chocolate|chocolate]] and enable it to mix well)\n| Place the [[Marinade|marinade]] and the [[Short ribs|short ribs]] in an oversized vacuum pouch.
