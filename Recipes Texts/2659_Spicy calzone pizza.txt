It's very hard to transfer once made up, without a pizza shovel.\n| Divide the ingredients in two:\n| Working on one half of the pizza (the base, when it's folded over), spread the [[tomato sauce]] over one half, leaving a clear edge to seal\n| Break the [[mozzarella]] into chunks and sprinkle over the [[sauce]], followed by the [[capers]], the sliced meat and half of the [[Parmesan cheese]]\n| Peel and quarter the egg and place around the pizza\n| Fold the [[pizza]] over, dampen the seal edges with a brush and water and press the edges to make a seal so it can puff up.\n| Sprinkle with the remaining [[Parmesan cheese]]\n| [[Bake]] for 15 to 20 minutes - keeping your eye on it!\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\n\nServe hot or cold\n\nGreat with [[creamy coleslaw]]\n===Chef's tip===\n\nFor an even better, more authentic pizza, use a [[pizza stone]].\n\n==See also==\n\nCalzone folding, [[Calzone folding|Here's how]].\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes|Pizza]]\n[[Category:Pizza recipes|Pizza]]\n[[Category:Cheese recipes|Pizza]]\n[[Category:Egg recipes|Pizza]]\n[[Category:Main courses|Pizza]]\n[[Category:Italian recipes]]\n[[Category:Spicy recipes|Pizza]]\n[[Category:North American recipes]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#parmesancheese #spicycalzonepizza #capers #pizza #bake #freerangeeggs #speck #homesmokedbacon #pizzadough #salami #miseenplace </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
