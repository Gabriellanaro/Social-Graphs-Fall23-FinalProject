I've found the best way is to use a meta-based pan, similar to a baking tray.  The metal base gets hot enough to crisp the base properly.  I have a really heavy rectangular Le Creuset baking tray that is absolutely ideal.  It seems a shame as it will mean I'll never use my earthenware deep pan pizza dish again!\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| 2 medium [[chicken breasts]] chopped very finely.\n| 1 small [[Onion|onion]], chopped finely\n| 3 cloves of [[garlic]], peeled and crushed\n| 1 teaspoon [[Chilli flakes|chilli flakes]] (Guajillo - not too hot)\n| 1 teaspoon dried [[oregano]]\n| 1 portion of [[Pizza dough|pizza dough]]\n| [[Fine yellow cornmeal]] for dusting\n| 110 g (4 oz) [[Cheddar cheese]], [[Grated|grated]]\n| 85 g (3.5 oz) freshly [[Grated|grated]] [[Parmesan cheese]]\n| 1 large can of chopped peeled [[Tomatoes|tomatoes]], left to drain over a coarse sieve for 5 minutes\n| Pinch of [[Black pepper|black pepper]]\n| 1 ball of [[Buffalo|buffalo]] [[Mozzarella|mozzarella]], torn\n\n}}\n\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n\n* Preheat the [[Oven|oven]] to 190\u00b0 C (375\u00b0 F - gas 5), [fan oven 170\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]\n* Make the [[Dough|dough]] as instructed\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Spicy chicken mozarella.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Just before the grated parmesan is added\nImage:Spicy chicken pizza.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Chicken cooked, ready to add\n</gallery>\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Add 2 tablespoons of olive oil to a hot frying paan or [[wok]] and add a good grind of [[black pepper]]\n| Add the [[onions]] and saut\u00e9 for 3 minutes.\n| Stir in the chopped [[chicken breasts]], the [[garlic]], the [[chilli flakes]] and [[oregano]] and stir-fry for 3 or 4 minutes just to colour the chicken.\n| [[Spray]] or lightly [[Oil|oil]] a deep 25cm (10\") pizza dish or pan\n| Roll out 2/3rds of the [[Dough|dough]] to about 3mm and line a pan so the [[Dough|dough]] just  overlaps the edges and trim any excess\n| Sprinkle the base with the [[Cheddar cheese]]\n| Add the chicken mixture\n| Sprinkle with one third of the [[Parmesan cheese]]\n| Roll out the remaining [[Dough|dough]] to make a lid\n| Pinch the lid so it joins the base and make a few slashed in the top for [[Steam|steam]] to escape\n| Mix another third of the [[Parmesan cheese]] with the [[Herbs|herbs]] and [[Spices|spices]] and mix into the [[Tomatoes|tomatoes]]\n| Spread the tomato mixture over the top of the [[Dough|dough]]\n| Top with crumbled [[Mozzarella|mozzarella]] and sprinkle with the remaining [[Parmesan cheese]]\n| [[Bake]] for 45 minutes, resting a sheet of [[Tin-foil|tin-foil]] on top of the [[Pizza|pizza]] for the final 10 minutes\n| Allow to cool for 10 minutes before slicing and serving\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe with a [[Green salad|green salad]]\n\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:North American recipes]]\n[[Category:Bread and baking]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Pizza recipes]]\n[[Category:I believe I can fry recipes]]\n[[Category:Recipes from other sites]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n[[Category:Favourite recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#dough #parmesancheese #spicychickendeeppanpizzapie #grated #cheddarcheese #oregano #pizzadough #tomatoes #chilliflakes #mozzarella #garlic </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
