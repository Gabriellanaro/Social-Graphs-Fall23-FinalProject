However as there are lots of powerful spices in this, coupled with an 8 hour cook, I think it will be just as good without the extended marinating.\n\nThe [[Meat|meat]] is great as a main meal with [[Vegetables|vegetables]] and [[potatoes]] or with a salad or even as a [[Sandwich|sandwich]] filler.  My favourite way is to have it as a [[Kebab|kebab]]-type filling in [[Pitta bread|pitta bread]] with [[Salad|salad]].\n\nI have included this in the North American recipe category as a homage to the original.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 1.3 kg (3 lb) boneless [[Pork shoulder|pork shoulder]].\n| &#189; tablespoon coarsely [[Ground black pepper|ground black pepper]]\n| &#189; tablespoon coarsely ground [[Szechuan pepper]]\n| 1 tablespoon [[Smoked paprika powder|smoked paprika powder]]\n| 3 tablespoons [[Paprika powder|paprika powder]]\n| 4 tablespoons cane [[Sugar|sugar]]\n| 2 teaspoons [[Coarse sea salt|coarse sea salt]]\n| 2 teaspoons [[Mustard powder|mustard powder]])\n| 2 tablespoons [[Garlic powder|garlic powder]]\n| 1 tablespoon [[Ginger powder|ginger powder]]\n| 1 teaspoon [[Cayenne pepper|cayenne pepper]] or a [[Chilli powder|chilli powder]] mix of your choice\n| &#189; cup  [[Shaoxing rice wine]], [[Sherry|sherry]] or even spirit of your choice\n| 1 [[Onion|onion]], peeled and roughly chopped\n| 1 [[Armagh_Bramley_Apples|Bramley apple]], peeled, cored and sliced\n\n}}\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:pulled pork in a slow cooker.jpg|Pork joint after 8 hours, shredded and ready to serve\n</gallery>\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Mix the [[Spices|spices]], cut deep slashes on both sides of the joint so you have lots af places to pack the rub into.\n| Carefully slice the rind from the joint and discard it.\n| Ensure that the rub fills all of the cuts you've made and all surfaces are well covered.\n| Chop the [[Apple|apple]] and [[Onion|onion]] and place in the base of the [[slow cooker]]\n| Sit the pork on top of the onions and apples.\n| Pour the wine down the side of the cooker so as not to wash off the rub.\n| Slow cook on low for 8 hours.  It never seems to hurt if you cook a dish like this for longer, so don't worry if you have to leave it cooking for longer.\n| If you get the chance, turn the meat halfway through the cooking process\n| 30 minutes before you are ready to serve, use two forks and shred the meat while it's still in the slow cooker and then leave it to cook in the gravy for the final 30 minutes.\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nShred with two forks and serve in [[Pitta breads|pitta breads]] with a [[Green salad|green salad]].\n{{Template:See-also-pulled-pork}}\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:North American recipes]]\n[[Category:Slow cooker recipes]]\n[[Category:Pork recipes]]\n[[Category:Cooking with wine]]\n[[Category:FotoosVanRobin recipes]]\n[[Category:Stewed, braised or pot roasted]]\n[[Category:Favourite recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#slowcooker #onion #groundblackpepper #smokedpaprikapowder #vegetables #greensalad #coarseseasalt #chillipowder #sherry #cayennepepper #apple </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
