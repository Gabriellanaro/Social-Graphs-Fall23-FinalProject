[[Rice vinegar|Black rice vinegar]] is also a very good substitute.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 1 kg Selection of [[chicken]] legs and thighs, with [[bones]] and skin, for four people\n| 8 teaspoons [[balsamic vinegar]]\n| 8 teaspoons [[soy sauce]]\n| 1 finely sliced [[onion]]\n| 4 [[garlic cloves, peeled and crushed]]\n| 1 whole [[bay leaf]]\n| &frac12; teaspoon [[black peppercorns]], partially crushed in a mortal and pestle\n| [[Vegetable oil]] for [[frying]]\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Sear the [[chicken]] in a hot pan for about 4 minutes, [[browning]]  the legs and thighs. Leave them in the pan\n| Turn down the heat and add some [[oil]], add the [[onions]] and [[Garlic|garlic]] and soften the [[onions]]. When they are translucent, add the [[vinegar]]\n| Let the [[vinegar]] almost [[boil]] away before you stir the pan\n| Once the [[vinegar]] has reduced, add in the [[soy sauce]], [[bay leaf]] and [[pepper]].\n| Cook until the [[sauce]] has reduced more and the [[chicken]] is properly cooked. Real adobo should be on the dry side\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\n\nServe with [[plain boiled rice]]\n==See also==\n* [[Chilli sauce|Many other chilli sauce recipes]]\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Accompaniments]]\n[[Category:Chilli pepper recipes]]\n[[Category:Oriental cuisine]]\n[[Category:Dips and sauces]]\n[[Category:Marinades dressings and butters]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:Poultry recipes]]\n[[Category:Spices|Adobo]]\n[[Category:Spicy recipes]]\n[[Category:Boiled or simmered]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#chicken #vinegar #balsamicvinegar #onions #bayleaf #adobosaucerecipe #soysauce #ricevinegar #bones #blackpeppercorns #browning </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
