Carp would be fine if you can get it.\n\nThe time I cooked and photographed this meal I could not get [[spring onions]] or [[black beans]] so I used a small [[onion]], sliced thinly and 4 large [[anchovies]], finely chopped, instead of the [[black beans]].  I also used two small sea bass instead of 1 large.  Moral: Don't go shopping late on a Bank Holiday Sunday! However, it was still a great success.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 1  750g (1.5 lbs) whole [[fish]], [[sea bass]], [[trout]] or carp, cleaned and gutted (use two if you can only get small fish)\n| 1 teaspoon [[sea salt]]\n| 1 teaspoon [[freshly ground black pepper]]\n| 1 teaspoon [[ground ginger powder]]\n| 1 teaspoon salted [[black beans]], soaked, drained and crushed lightly, or 4 large [[anchovies]], finely chopped\n| 1 teaspoon [[dark soy sauce]]\n| 1 teaspoon [[sugar]]\n| 1 tablespoon Chinese [[wine]] or [[dry sherry]]\n| 1 tablespoon [[root ginger]], peeled and finely [[shredded]]\n| 2 star anise, broken into small pieces\n| 2 [[spring onions]], [[cut on the diagonal]], or 1 small [[onion]], peeled and finely sliced\n| 2 tablespoons [[vegetable oil]]\n| Sheet of [[tin foil]], large enough to wrap loosely around the [[fish]]\n| '''Dressing'''\n| 1tbs [[light soy sauce]]\n| 1 teaspoon [[sesame oil]]\n\n}}\n\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n* Preheat the [[oven]] to 180\u00b0 C (350\u00b0 F - gas 4), [fan oven 160\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| [[Descale]], rinse and and dry the [[fish]]\n| With a sharp knife make deep cuts across both sides of the [[fish]].  On a very large fish make criss-cross cuts\n| Mix the [[salt]], [[pepper]] and [[ginger powder]] together and rub well into the slashes in the [[fish]]\n| Mix the crushed [[black beans]], [[dark soy sauce]], [[sugar]] and Chinese [[wine]]\n| Sprinkle the shredded ginger and [[spring onions]] on the tin foil and lay the [[fish]] on top\n| Heat 2 tablespoons of [[oil]] until [[smoking]] and carefully pour this all over the [[fish]]\n| When the [[oil]] has cooled a little, spread the [[black bean]] mixture all over the [[fish]] and in the cavity\n| Arrange the broken star anise pieces throughout the cavity of the fish\n| Bring the foil up and seal well and place on a [[baking]] tray\n| [[bake]] for 20 minutes or until the [[fish]] is tender\n| Arrange on a serving platter and pour the [[soy]] dressing over the [[fish]]\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe immediately.\n\nThis is nice with [[special fried rice]] and a [[green salad]]\n===Chef's tip===\nIf you use two small fish instead of 1 large, as long as your tin foil is large enough, it's probably better to use 1 foil parcel for both fish as the flavours seem to mingle better. \n===Variation===\nThis recipe would work equally well with [[trout]].\n{{Template:PeelingGinger}}\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Oriental cuisine]]\n[[Category:Chinese recipes]]\n[[Category:Fish recipes]]\n[[Category:Sea fish recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Cooking with wine]]\n[[Category:Favourite recipes]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#fish #blackbeans #springonions #darksoysauce #wine #trout #anchovies #onion #seabass #baking #specialfriedrice </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
