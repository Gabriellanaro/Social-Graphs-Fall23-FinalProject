It's very tasty and easy to make.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 2 tablespoons [[groundnut oil]]\n| 450 g (1 lb) cubed stewing steak / chuck steak etc\n| 1 [[clove garlic, crushed]]\n| 3 tablespoons [[light soy sauce]]\n| 1 tablespoon water - more if required\n| 1 teaspoon [[salt]]\n| 3 tablespoons [[rice wine]] or [[dry sherry]]\n| 1 teaspoon [[sugar]]\n| 2 whole [[star anise]] cloves\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Heat the oil in a wok and brown the beef on all sides\n| Add the remaining ingredients and bring to the boil, cover and reduce the heat and simmer for 45 minutes.  I prefer to cover the wok whilst simmering, or it does dry out.\n| Turn the meat over and add a little more water if the meat is drying out. Remove the cover now so it can reduce a little.\n| Simmer for a further 45 minutes\n| If it is too ''wet'', just turn the heat up for a few minutes and reduce a little. I think this should be quite dry, as pictured.\n| Remove from the wok, discarding the star anise, keep warm and rest for 5 minutes\n}}\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Stewed beef and rice.jpg|300px|thumb|right|Almost done\nImage:Slow-cooking-star-anise-beef.jpg|300px|thumb|right|Still ''wet'' at the stewing stage\n</gallery>\n\n===Serving suggestions===\n\nServe with [[egg fried rice]] or even the pictured [[very special egg fried rice]], which was a brilliant surprise and a meal in itself.\n\nThis would be good cold too, maybe with a salad.\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Beef recipes]]\n[[Category:Oriental cuisine]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:Stews and casseroles]]\n[[Category:Cooking with wine]]\n[[Category:Favourite recipes]]\n[[Category:Stewed, braised or pot roasted]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#braisedstaranisebeef #drysherry #lightsoysauce #eggfriedrice #staranise #ricewine #stewedbraisedorpotroasted #groundnutoil </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
