An ideal way to prepare chicken for a spicy salad.\n\nWhy not try [[Jointing a chicken|jointing your first chicken]] for this recipe?\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 1 [[chicken]] breast\n| 2 slices [[ginger]] root, chopped into matchsticks\n| 1 clove [[Garlic|garlic]], sliced\n| 1 large [[spring onion]] (scallion) finely chopped\n| 1 teaspoon [[soy sauce]]\n| 1 teaspoon [[chili flakes]] or 1 fresh red chili, julienned\n| 1 squeeze lime or [[lemon]] juice\n}}\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Place the chicken breast on a piece of [[foil]] large enough to wrap the chicken in a parcel\n| Lay the chicken on a bed made from half of the ingredients then scatter the remaining over the top\n| Wrap the chicken in the foil\n| I use a vegetable steamer on an upturned bowl in a large pan, but a normal Chinese steamer works ok\n| Bring a saucepan of water to the boil and place the chicken on your steamer so it's over but not immersed in water\n| Cover and simmer for 20 to 30 minutes or until the chicken properly cooked. Core of chicken breast 74\u00b0 C (165\u00b0 F)   It will depend on the size of the chicken.\n| Don't allow it to boil dry!\n| Discard all but the chicken once cooked\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\n\nServe hot or cold.  [[Chicken with cold tossed beansprouts]] is good with chicken cooked this way.\n\n===Variations===\n\nAdd more [[chili]], [[ginger]] or [[Garlic|garlic]] if you are crazy for the stuff.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Steamed chicken]]\n* [[Poached chicken]]\n* [[Chinese style steamed chicken]]\n* [[Whole chicken pressure cooker recipe]]\n* [[Boiled chicken pieces]]\n* {{See also - Jointing a chicken}}\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes|Chicken]]\n[[Category:Poultry recipes]]\n[[Category:Oriental cuisine|Chicken]]\n[[Category:Main courses|Chicken]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes|Chicken]]\n[[Category:Chinese recipes]]\n[[Category:Favourite recipes]]\n[[Category:Steamed]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#chinesestylesteamedchicken #garlic #ginger #springonion #lemon #chicken #steamedchicken #steamed #foil #poachedchicken #chiliflakes </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
