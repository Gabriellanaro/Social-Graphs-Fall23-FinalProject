A piece of bread should sizzle and brown in a few seconds.\n| Add the greens and fry for 2-3 minutes\n| '''This may need to be done in a few batches''' to prevent the temperature of the oil from dropping too far. Adding too much in one go can cause the oil to froth over the side of the pan which poses '''a severe fire risk'''.\n| Remove from the oil with a [[slotted spoon]] or the mesh basket of the deep fat fryer and drain well on absorbent kitchen paper\n| Place on a heated serving dish, mix the [[salt]] and sugar together and sprinkle evenly over the greens\n}}\n===Chef's notes===\nMake sure the spring greens leaves are well dried by putting in a [[salad spinner]] or wrapping in a clean dry [[tea towel]] and shaking. Any remaining water can detrimentally affect the deep frying process and give rise to an inferior finished product.\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes|Cabbage]]\n[[Category:Oriental cuisine|Cabbage]]\n[[Category:Accompaniments|Cabbage]]\n[[Category:Starters|Cabbage]]\n[[Category:Vegan recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegetable recipes|Cabbage]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes|Cabbage]]\n[[Category:Snacks and light bites]]\n[[Category:Deep fried]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#crispyseaweed #deepfrying #frying #teatowel #saladspinner #deepfried #bokchoi #slottedspoon #springgreens </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
