Disappointingly, after I had assembled them and check teh internets ''(sic)'', I discover that I am not the first to make this :-)\n\nIt's very much an experiment, made from what was available when the shops were shut. One of the things I may change is to use [[Belazu chilli jelly]], instead of [[Cranberry jelly|cranberry jelly]] - or maybe that can be another recipe.\n\nThis version uses [[p\u00e2t\u00e9]] rather than [[duxelles]].  It was an absolute success and more versions will certainly follow.\n\nFrom the ingredients you would think that it would serve just two people as the chicken breasts were quite small and the bacon very thin.  However we both agreed that as they were they could easily have serve 4 people, especially if served with extra vegetables.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 1 medium [[Onion|onion]], peeled and finely chopped\n| 3 Cloves [[Garlic|garlic]], peeled and thinly sliced\n| 2 tablespoons of  [[Olive oil]]\n| [[Freshly ground black pepper|freshly ground black pepper]]\n| 170 g coarse [[Pork|pork]] and [[Mushroom|mushroom]] p\u00e2t\u00e9\n| 6 rashers [[Bacon|bacon]]\n| 2 large [https://www.cookipedia.co.uk/calories/chicken/bq/2#jump chicken breasts]\n| 375g Jus Rol, ready rolled [[Puff pastry|puff pastry]]\n| 2 [[Egg yolks|egg yolks]] for [[Brushing|brushing]] the [[Pastry|pastry]].\n}}\n\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n* Preheat the [[Oven|oven]] to 220\u00b0 C (425\u00b0 F - gas 7), [fan oven 200\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]\n===Method===\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Chicken Wellington ready to bake.jpg|[[Chicken]] Wellingtons, ready to bake\nImage:Chicken Wellington rolled in cling-film.jpg|Roll in cling-film and chill\nImage:Chicken Wellington bacon spread with pate.jpg|Bacon spread with and pate\nImage:Chicken Wellington Pate, onions and garlic, ready to spread.jpg|Pate, onions and garlic, ready to spread\nImage:Chicken Wellington ingredients.jpg|[[Chicken]] Wellington, the ingredients\n</gallery>\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Add the [[Olive oil|olive oil]] to a small pan and give it a good grind of [[Black pepper|black pepper]]\n| Very gently [[Fry|fry]] the [[Garlic|garlic]] and [[Onions|onions]] for 10 minutes in the [[Oil|oil]] until soft\n| Add the p\u00e2t\u00e9, heat and stir until it breaks down and mingles with the [[Onions|onions]]. remove from the heat and allow to cool a little.\n| Lay 3 rashers of [[Bacon|bacon]] out on a large sheet of [[Cling-film|cling-film]] and spread half of the [[Pate|pate]] over the bacon\n| With a sharp knife, make a pocket in the [[Chicken breast|chicken breast]] and add a tablespoon of [[Cranberry|cranberry]] jelly\n| Lay the [[Chicken breast|chicken breast]] on the [[Bacon|bacon]] and with the [[Help|help]] of the [[Cling-film|cling-film]], roll up into a parcel and 'twizzle' the ends to seal.\n| Repeat for the other [[Chicken breast|chicken breast]].\n| Chill in the [[Refrigerator|refrigerator]] for 30 minutes, at the same time, remove the [[Puff-pastry|puff-pastry]] and allow it to reach room temperature.\n| After 30 minutes, remove the [[Cling-film|cling-film]] and wrap each [[Chicken|chicken]]/[[Bacon|bacon]] parcel in [[Puff pastry|puff pastry]]. There will be enough for two in 1 pack of ready-rolled [[Pastry|pastry]].\n| You can either make the Wellington properly by [[Brushing|brushing]] the [[Pastry|pastry]] joins with [[Egg|egg]]-[[Yolk|yolk]] and pressing together with the tines of a fork, or [[Cheat|cheat]] as I have by twisting the joins like a [[Calzone pizza]] or a [[Cornish pasty]].\n| [[Brush]] the surface of the Wellingtons with [[Egg|egg]]-[[Yolk|yolk]] so they colour when [[Baked|baked]].\n| Chill the Wellingtons in the [[Fridge|fridge]] while the [[Oven|oven]] warms up, then [[Bake|bake]] for 35 to 40 minutes - Check the [[Chicken|chicken]] is properly cooked then serve.\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe with [[Hasselback potatoes]] and [[Peas|peas]]\n===Chef's notes===\nI was a little concerned that the [[chicken]] would not be cooked in the 20 to 30 minutes that it normally takes to cook [[puff pastry]].  In the event we cooked them in the oven with the [[hasselback potatoes]], which took almost an hour.  The chicken was very moist, probably due to the [[cranberry sauce]] and pate, yet the pastry was perfect - super crunchy!\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:Poultry recipes]]\n[[Category:Favourite recipes]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#chickenwellington #chicken #bacon #chickenbreast #pastry #puffpastry #onions #hasselbackpotatoes #oliveoil #yolk #brushing </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
