We loved Japanese cuisine, really loved it. Their soups and broths, usually served with noodles (soba, ramen, siratka, udon etc etc) are to die for; a lot of them start with this incredibly simple, incredibly important stock. We buy our konbu (dried kelp seaweed), and katsuobushi (dried bonito flakes) from the Wing Yip supermarket in Shirley, South London. You can also get it online or in person through [[The Japan Centre]]\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| 10cm x 10cm piece of [[Konbu|konbu]] \n| 30g [[Katsuobushi|katsuobushi]] \n| 1.5 [[Litres|litres]] of water\n}}\n\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| Wipe the [[Konbu|konbu]] with a barely damp cloth if it has a white bloom on it.\n| Put the water in a medium sized [[Saucepan|saucepan]] with the konbu and leave to soak for 30 minutes.\n| Put the [[Saucepan|saucepan]] on the [[Stove|stove]], and start to bring to the [[Boil|boil]].\n| Just as it starts to [[Bubble|bubble]], remove the [[Konbu|konbu]] and discard. Add the [[Katsuobushi|katsuobushi]] and turn the heat to medium.\n| As soon as it starts to bubble, turn the heat off, and leave till all the katsuobushi sinks to the bottom of the pan. Once it has, [[Sieve|sieve]] the liquid, discarding the katsuobushi.\n| It freezes well; we put it in 250 and 500ml containers.\n}}\n===Recipe source===\n\n* https://sites.google.com/site/nikandedwinascookbook/Home/building-blocks/dashi-japanese-broth-stock\n===See also===\n: [[Dashi]]\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Oriental cuisine]]\n[[Category:Soup and stock recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes]]\n[[Category:Fish recipes]]\n[[Category:Nik and Edwina's Cookbook recipes]]\n[[Category:Boiled or simmered]]\n[[Category:Recipes from other sites]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#konbu #katsuobushi #saucepan #dashistockrecipe #litres #dashi #stove #cookipedia #boil #recipesfromothersites #bubble </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
