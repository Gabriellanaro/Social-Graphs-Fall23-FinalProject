Far nicer than frozen if you have them.\n\nYou can use grated [[ginger]] root or bottled ginger instead of the [[julienned]] ginger.  I just think that with matchsticks of ginger, you get a zesty tang when yo bite into the pieces. \n\n==See also==\n* {{See also - Jointing a chicken}}\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes|Chicken]]\n[[Category:Chilli pepper recipes|Chicken]]\n[[Category:Garlic recipes]]\n[[Category:Poultry recipes|Garlic Chicken]]\n[[Category:Oriental cuisine|Chicken]]\n[[Category:Main courses|Chicken]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes|Chicken]]\n[[Category:Spicy recipes|Chicken]]\n[[Category:Pasta recipes|Chicken]]\n[[Category:Cooking with wine]]\n[[Category:Boiled or simmered]][[Category:Stir fried]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#garlicchickenvermicelli #cornflour #ginger #cabbage #garlic #wok #oystersauce #chickenstock #greenbellpeppers #ricewine #noodles </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
