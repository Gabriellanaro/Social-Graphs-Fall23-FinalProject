The dish is named after Ding Baozhen (1820\u20131886), a late Qing Dynasty official. Born in Guizhou, Ding served as head of Shandong province and later as governor of Sichuan province. His title was G&#333;ng B&#462;o (&#23470;&#20445;), or palatial guardian. The name \"Kung Pao\" chicken is derived from this title.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 450g (1 lb) [[chicken]], cubed\n| 1 egg white\n| 1 teaspoon [[salt]]\n| 2 tablespoons [[cornflour]]\n| 4 tablespoons [[groundnut oil]]\n| 8 hot [[dried chili peppers]] (or to taste)\n| Handful of [[toasted]] [[cashew nuts]], unsalted if possible\n| 1 small [[onion]], sliced\n| 2 small [[carrots]], [[julienned]] and then chopped\n| 1 teaspoon minced [[Garlic|garlic]]\n| 2 tablespoons [[light soy sauce]]\n| 1 tablespoon [[rice wine]] or [[dry sherry]]\n| 2 teaspoons [[sugar]]\n| 2 teaspoons of [[white wine vinegar]]\n| 1 teaspoon [[sesame oil]]\n| 3 tablespoons of water\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| In a bowl, mix the egg white, salt and half the [[cornflour]], then coat the cubed chicken pieces with this mixture and leave to [[marinate]] for 30 minutes\n| Heat the oil in a wok and fry the [[onions]] and [[carrots]] for 4 minutes and reserve\n| Fry the chicken until lightly browned then remove from pan\n| Add the [[Garlic|garlic]] and chillies and [[stir-fry]] for 2 minutes\n| Return the [[chicken]], [[onions]] and [[carrots]] to the [[wok]] and add the [[soy sauce]], [[wine]], [[sugar]], [[vinegar]] and [[sesame oil]] and stir-fry for 2 minutes\n| In a saucer, mix the remaining [[cornflour]] and water into a smooth paste\n| Add the paste to the [[wok]] and mix well\n| Simmer, stirring as required, until the sauce clears and the [[chicken]] is properly cooked\n| Add the [[toasted]] [[cashew nuts]] just before serving to ensure they stay crunchy\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe with [[Plain rice|plain rice]] or [[egg fried rice]]\n===Chef's notes===\nCarrots and onions may not be authentic, but I like the colour and crunch of the carrots and the taste of the onions.\n\nIf you really don't like crunchy carrots, you may want to [[parboil]] them for a few minutes before you start cooking the dish.\n\n==See also==\n\n* {{See also - Jointing a chicken}}\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Chilli pepper recipes]]\n[[Category:Chinese recipes]]\n[[Category:Oriental cuisine]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:Poultry recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses|Chicken]]\n[[Category:Spicy recipes|Chicken]]\n[[Category:Cooking with wine]]\n[[Category:Stir fried]][[Category:Boiled or simmered]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#kungpochicken #chicken #carrots #cornflour #toasted #eggfriedrice #onions #garlic #sesameoil #cashewnuts #wok </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
