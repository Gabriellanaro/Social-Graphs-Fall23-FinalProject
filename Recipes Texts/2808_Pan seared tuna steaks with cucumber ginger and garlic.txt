Eating the long lengths of cucumber was quite fun, rolling up on a fork like spaghetti.\n===Variations===\nI always use my [[homemade lazy ginger]] instead of fresh ginger as it keeps so much better and tastes as good.  Instead of the water, I used the lovely gingery vinegar from my [[lazy ginger]].\n===Chef's notes===\nA fabulous recipe this, the only change I would make would be to slice the cucumber a little thicker using a [[mandoline]] instead of a [[speed peeler]].\n{{Template:PeelingGinger}}\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Oriental cuisine]]\n[[Category:Vietnamese recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Spicy recipes]]\n[[Category:Fish recipes]]\n[[Category:Sea fish recipes]]\n[[Category:Favourite recipes]]\n[[Category:Grilled, griddled or barbecued]]\n[[Category:Pan fried]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#cucumber #mandoline #pansearedtunasteakswithcucumbergingerandgarlic #sesameoil #garlic #tunasteaks #fishsauce #limejuice #panfried #nuocmam #cucumbers </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
