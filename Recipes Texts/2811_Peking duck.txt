Have a go at this as it's pretty simple to do and does not involve a bicycle pump - as I saw on one TV program a few years ago!\n[[Image:Aromatic duck.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Commercially prepared aromatic duck - \u00a37.50 (2008)]]\n\nYou can make the [[crispy duck pancakes]] from our [[special crispy duck pancake recipe]] or buy them from an Asian wholesaler.  Look in the freezer compartments, they are usually sold [[frozen]] in quantities of about 100, separately wrapped in 10's.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 1 whole [[duck]] - plucked and oven ready\n| 6 [[spring onions]] - [[Julienned|julienned]]\n| 1 [[cucumber]], peeled, de-seeded if you're apt to wind, and julienned.\n| 1 [[lemon]]\n| 3 tablespoons [[maltose]]\n| 1 tablespoon Chinese red wine\n| 20 [[Crispy duck pancakes]] or [[lettuce]] leaves to roll in\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Set a large pan of water boiling, immerse the [[duck]] and cook for 5 minutes, stirring frequently. Take out the duck, and refresh for a minute in a large bowl of cold water\n| Allow to drip-dry, ideally by hanging from a hook or resting on a rack\n| Mix 18fl oz (500ml) boiling water with the juice and rind of 1 [[lemon]], together with 3 tablespoons maltose and 1 tablespoon Chinese red wine [[vinegar]]\n| With a clean & dry cloth or [[tea towel]], dry the duck inside and out\n| Using a pastry or [[Basting|basting brush]], paint the marinade all over\n| Hanging to dry, preferably overnight\n| In the hottest oven you can muster, roast the duck for 45 minutes\n| Remove from the oven and rest for 10 minutes\n| When carving, strip all of the meat and skin from the bird and then, using two forks, shred it to smithereens\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\n\nIf you've had this dish before, waste no more time, just get to it and eat. \n\nOtherwise, read on: lay out each pancake as and when you are ready to eat it. Spread a teaspoon of the sauce of your choosing (hoisin, [[chili]], plum). Add a small portion of [[cucumber]]. Ditto, spring [[onions]]. Add some shredded duck, roll up and eat. Repeat until the duck is no more (it is an ex-duck!!).\n\n[[Plum & ginger sauce]] goes well with Peking duck too.\n\n===Mexican Variations===\n\nAlthough it needs easy preparation but which is 24 hours in advance, try [[Cochinita pibil]] (pork) instead of duck as the meat filling for the pancakes.\n\n===North African===\n\nOr my own North African-styled variation with lamb: [[Spicy lamb tortillas]].\n\n==See also==\n* '''Procedure to make a [[How to make crispy aromatic duck at home|complete crispy duck meal at home]].'''\n\n{{Template:PeelingGinger}}\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes|Duck]]\n[[Category:Poultry recipes|Duck]]\n[[Category:Oriental cuisine|Duck]]\n[[Category:Main courses|Duck]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes|Duck]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted|Duck]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#pekingduck #cucumber #duck #lemon #crispyduckpancakes #julienned #springonions #teatowel #bakedorroastedduck #cochinitapibil #vinegar </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
