''(Cover with aluminium foil or cling film to stop the cats getting at them - as well as airborne bacteria)''\n| Cook the [[chicken]] on preheated sandwich press for 12 minutes, turning once.  A barbecue hotplate would take about the same time but you will need to turn it more often.\n| Sprinkle with the freshly chopped [[herbs]] \n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe hot with plain rice and a salad.\n==See also==\n* {{See also - Jointing a chicken}}{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Barbecue recipes]]\n[[Category:Cookery cheats]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:Oriental cuisine]]\n[[Category:Favourite recipes]]\n[[Category:Grilled, griddled or barbecued]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#chicken #spicybarbecuedchinkiangchicken #chinkiangricevinegar #szechuanpeppercorns #oliveoil #herbs #balsamicvinegar #parsley #muscovadosugar #coriander #jaggery </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
