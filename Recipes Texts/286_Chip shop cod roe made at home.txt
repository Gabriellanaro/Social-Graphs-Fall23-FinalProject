However, if like me you're a fan of chip shop style [[Cod|cod]] [[Roe|roe]] then you're in luck as almost all [[Fried|fried]] cod roe served in [[Fish|fish]] and chip shops is canned, and very reasonably priced too.\n\nFor greater economy, buy the 600 g can instead of the 200 g tin, cut the roe into 100g slices and [[Freeze|freeze]] the remaining segments for later use.\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| 200g can Princes [[Pressed cod roe|pressed cod roe]]\n| 2 tablespoons [[Plain flour|plain flour]]\n| 1 [[Egg|egg]], beaten with 1 tablespoon cold water\n| 75g [[Panko]] or dried [[breadcrumbs]] (flavoured with lemon and black pepper, if possible)\n| [[Olive oil]], for [[Frying|frying]]\n| 2 tablespoons of fresh [[Soured cream|soured cream]]\n| Chopped fresh [[Dill|dill]] or [[Parsley|parsley]] (optional)\n| [[Salad]] leaves, to serve\n}}\n\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| Carefully remove the [[Cod roe|cod roe]] from the can, in one piece. Slice through the middle horizontally to make two 100 g rounds.\n| Put the [[Flour|flour]] onto a plate and coat each [[Cod roe|cod roe]] round lightly with it, then [[Dip|dip]] into the beaten [[Egg|egg]], making sure they are coated around the sides. Finally, dip into the [[Breadcrumbs|breadcrumbs]] to coat completely.\n|  Heat the [[Vegetable oil|vegetable oil]] in a [[Frying pan|frying pan]] and cook the [[Roe|roe]] [[Fish cakes|fish cakes]] for 3 to 4 minutes on each side, turning them over carefully with a [[Fish slice|fish slice]].
