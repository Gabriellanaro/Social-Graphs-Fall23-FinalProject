It makes around 1750ml, which will last for 4 days in the [[Fridge|fridge]] and [[Freeze|freeze]]s very well - we freeze it in 250ml and 500ml containers (most recipes on this site that use it use multiples of these amounts), and also in ice cube [[Freezer|freezer]] bags, so we can pop a couple out for recipes like [[Crab]] Linguine which just uses a little. Making Nage creates one of the most comforting aromas in the world.\n\n''Nage is the term used in the USA for a flavoured liquid used for [[Poaching|poaching]] delicate foods, typically [[Seafood|seafood]]. A traditional nage is a [[Broth|broth]] flavoured with [[White wine|white wine]], [[Vegetables|vegetables]], and [[Herbs|herbs]], in which seafood is [[Poached|poached]]. The liquid is then reduced and thickened with [[Cream|cream]] and/or [[Butter|butter]].'' - Wikipedia\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| 3 roughly chopped [[Onions|onions]] \n| 6 chopped [[Carrots|carrots]]\n| 2 chopped [[Celery|celery]] sticks\n| 1 chopped [[Leek|leek]]\n| 2 [[Cloves of garlic|cloves of garlic]] (lightly bashed, optional)\n| 1 quartered [[Lemon|lemon]]\n| \u00bd teaspoon of [[Peppercorns|peppercorns]], pink and/or green ones if you have them, [[Black peppercorns|black peppercorns]] will be fine\n| 1 small [[Bay leaf|bay leaf]]\n| 4 whole [[Star anise|star anise]] (not optional)\n| 2 [[Litres|litres]] of cold water\n| Sprig each of fresh [[Tarragon|tarragon]], [[Basil|basil]], [[Coriander|coriander]], [[Thyme|thyme]] and curly leaf [[Parsley|parsley]]\n| 200ml [[Dry white wine|dry white wine]].\n}}\n\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| Put all ingredients except [[Wine|wine]] and [[Fresh herbs|fresh herbs]] in a large pan and bring to the [[Boil|boil]]\n| [[Simmer]] for 10 minutes, then remove from heat\n| Add the [[Fresh herbs|fresh herbs]] and [[Wine|wine]].
