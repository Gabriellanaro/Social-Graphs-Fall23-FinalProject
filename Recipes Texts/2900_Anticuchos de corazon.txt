The [[Meat|meat]] may be [[Marinated|marinated]] in [[Vinegar|vinegar]] and [[Spices|spices]] (such as [[Cumin|cumin]], aji [[Pepper|pepper]] and [[Garlic|garlic]]), and while anticuchos can be made of any type of meat, the most popular are made of [[Beef|beef]] [[Heart|heart]] (anticuchos de corazon). Anticuchos often come with a [[Boiled|boiled]] [[Potato|potato]] on the end of the skewer.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 1 Beef [[heart]]\n| 2 cloves of [[Garlic|garlic]]\n| &frac14; of a cup ground spicy [[red chili]]\n| 2 cups of [[malt vinegar]]\n| 1 teaspoon of ground [[cumin]]\n| 1 teaspoon of achiote ([[annatto]])\n| 1 teaspoon of [[salt]] \n| 1 teaspoon of ground [[black pepper]]\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Place all the above ingredients, other than the [[Heart|heart]], in a bowl and mix thoroughly.\n| Clean the [[Heart|heart]], removing all [[Fat|fat]]. Cut into bite size cubes. Place the heart pieces into the [[Marinade|marinade]] mixture and leave to [[Marinate|marinate]] for about 10 hours or overnight. The heart should be completely covered.\n| After [[Marinating|marinating]], insert [[Meat|meat]] on [[skewers]]. At this stage if desired , some additional ingredients such as [[Green pepper|green pepper]] or [[Red pepper|red pepper]] ([[Capsicum|capsicum]]) or [[Corn|corn]]-on-cob (cut to a similar size to the [[Heart|heart]], may be also inserted on the skewers.)  \n| The skewered [[Heart|heart]] should then be cooked on a [[Barbecue|barbecue]] [[Grill|grill]], turning frequently and brushing with the [[Marinade|marinade]] mix. When they are well done they should be served immediately.\n}}\n===Variations===\nIf [[Heart|heart]] is not to your taste, try a less-authentic version using a good cut of [[Beef|beef]].\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Barbecue recipes]]\n[[Category:Beef recipes]]\n[[Category:Latin American recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:Mexican recipes]]\n[[Category:Offal recipes]]\n[[Category:Peruvian recipes]]\n[[Category:Snacks and light bites]]\n[[Category:Grilled, griddled or barbecued]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#heart #anticuchosdecorazon #garlic #cumin #marinade #beef #redpepper #greenpepper #unusualrecipes #marinated #capsicum </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
