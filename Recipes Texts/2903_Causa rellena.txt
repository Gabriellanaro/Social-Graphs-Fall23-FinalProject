This particular recipe is typical of Peru's capital city, Lima and is also called '''Causa lime\u00f1a'''.  'Causa', meaning 'cause' does not have a culinary meaning in Spanish.  'Relleno/a' means stuffed.  In English language recipes, they are sometimes referred to as stuffed [[mashed potatoes]].  They are not really stuffed though, just layered.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 1.25kg cold [[Potatoes|potatoes]], peeled, [[Boiled|boiled]] and [[Mashed|mashed]] thoroughly\n| 125 ml [[Corn|corn]] or [[Olive oil|olive oil]]\n| 1 tablespoon [[Aj\u00ed pepper|aj\u00ed amarillo flakes]], soaked in the oil\n| 180 ml [[Lemon juice|lemon juice]]\n| [[Salt]] and [[Pepper|pepper]] to taste\n| &frac14; of a [[Spanish]] [[Onion|onion]], cut into thin strips\n| 8 [[Black olives|black olives]], stones removed, and cut in half\n| 2 [[Eggs, hard-boiled|eggs, hard-boiled]], and each sliced into quarters\n| Stuffing of your choice: [[Shredded|shredded]] [[Chicken|chicken]], [[Tuna|tuna]], [[Ham|ham]], [[Grated|grated]] [[Cheese|cheese]], [[Avocado|avocado]], [[Sardines|sardines]] or [[Prawns|prawns]]\n| 1 crisp [[Lettuce|lettuce]], [[Shredded|shredded]]\n| Chopped [[olives]], [[peppers]] etc to garnish (optional)\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| To the cold mashed potatoes, add the oil, [[Aj\u00ed pepper|aj\u00ed amarillo flakes]], lemon juice and seasonings and mix until the potato is smooth and manageable.\n| You now need to layer the causas.  The easiest way to do this is use a [[Mould|mould]] with both ends open.\n| Grease the [[Mould|mould]] and taking one-eighth of the [[Potato|potato]] mixture, smooth out in the bottom of the mould.\n| Place 2 [[Egg|egg]] slices on top, followed by 4 [[Olive|olive]] halves and a quarter of the [[Onions|onions]].\n| Then add a layer of your chosen stuffing.\n| Finally add a further eighth of the [[Potato|potato]] mixture.\n| When unmoulded, repeat the same until you have 4 causas.\n| Add garnishes if desired.\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nPlace the [[Shredded|shredded]] [[Lettuce|lettuce]] in the centre of a plate and gently unmould the causas on the top.\n===Variations===\nYou can make the whole thing in a greased [[Baking|baking]] dish if you have no moulds.\n===Chef's notes===\nThe quantity of [[Lemon juice|lemon juice]] does seem rather excessive, but will give it a go and see what happens.
