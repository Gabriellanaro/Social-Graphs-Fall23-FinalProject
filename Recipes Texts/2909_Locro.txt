The dish is a classic Ecuadorian [[Cheese|cheese]] and [[Potato|potato]] [[Soup|soup]] from the Ecuadorian cuisine. This is also a dish in Peruvian cuisine, which at one point held the centre of the Inca empire. It typical also in Argentina prepared by the different native Indian tribes at the time of the [[Spanish]] conquest. Its origin [[Dates|dates]] to before the Spanish colonial times.\n\nThe defining ingredients are [[Corn|corn]], some form of [[Meat|meat]] (usually [[Beef|beef]], but sometimes [[Beef jerky|beef jerky]] or [[Chorizo|chorizo]]), and [[Vegetables|vegetables]]. Other ingredients vary widely, and typically include [[Onion|onion]], [[Beans|beans]], [[Squash|squash]] or [[Pumpkin|pumpkin]]. It is mainly eaten in winter.\n\nIn some parts, such as in the Santiago del Estero Province of Argentina, a red hot sauce made from red peppers and paprika known as [[quiquirimichi]] is served on the side.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 2 tablespoons [[Olive oil|olive oil]]\n| 2 large [[Onions|onions]], peeled and sliced\n| 4 [[Cloves garlic, peeled and crushed|cloves garlic, peeled and crushed]]\n| 750 g (1.5 lb) [[Beef|beef]] [[Stewing|stewing]] [[Steak|steak]], cut into cubes\n| 1 x 400g (14 oz) can of peeled [[Tomatoes|tomatoes]]\n| 1/2 a teaspoon of ground white [[cumin]]\n| 1/2 a teaspoon of dried [[oregano]]\n| 1 teaspoon freshly ground [[coriander]] seeds\n| 1 bay leaf\n| Juice from 1/2 a lemon\n| 150 ml (1/4 pint) [[Beef Stock|beef stock]]\n| 2 tablespoons of [[Paprika powder|paprika powder]]\n| &#189; of a teaspoon of [[Chilli powder|chilli powder]], or to taste.\n| 1 x 400g (14 oz) can of [[Chickpeas|chickpeas]], rinsed and drained\n| 125 g whole [[Chorizo sausage|chorizo sausage]], sliced thickly\n| 200 g can of [[Sweetcorn|sweetcorn]], rinsed and drained\n| 75 g [[Mozzarella cheese|mozzarella cheese]] cut into cubes\n| [[Salt]] and [[Freshly ground black pepper|freshly ground black pepper]] to taste\n| 2 tablespoons of [[masa harina]] or [[yellow cornmeal]], optional thickening.\n}}\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Locro simmering.jpg|Seal the lid with [[tin foil]] to prevent the stew from drying out\nImage:Locro pie.jpg|Locro pie with [[potato dumplings]]\nImage:Locro pie oven-ready.jpg|Locro pie with [[potato dumplings]], ready for the oven\n</gallery>\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Heat the [[Oil|oil]] in a large pan or [[Dutch Oven|Dutch oven]] and saut\u00e9 the [[Onions|onions]] and [[Garlic|garlic]] for 4 minutes or until softened and slightly coloured.\n| Reserve the onions, increase the heat and brown the beef, a handful of pieces at a time.\n| Add the onions back to the pan, together with the [[Tomatoes|tomatoes]] and their juice. Also add the [[lemon juice]], [[Stock|stock]], ground spices, [[Paprika|paprika]], [[Chili powder|chili powder]], [[Salt|salt]] and [[Pepper|pepper]]. \n| Bring to the [[Boil|boil]] then cover and [[Simmer|simmer]] for 2 hours.\n| Stir in the cornmeal to thicken if needed. Add the [[Chorizo|chorizo]], [[Chick peas|chick peas]] and [[Sweetcorn|sweetcorn]] and [[Simmer|simmer]] for a further 30 minutes\n| Transfer to serving bowls and dot with pieces of [[Mozzarella cheese|mozzarella cheese]].\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe with crusty [[Bread|bread]].\n\nI'm not sure about the authenticity, but plain [[tortilla chips]] were a marvellous accompaniment to this dish.\n===Chef's notes===\nI find it useful to use a few layers of scrunched-up [[tin foil]] under the lid to seal the pot because this prevents the contents from drying out when [[simmering]] for long periods of time.\n===Variations===\nWe used the (frozen) second half of the locro to make a sort of South-American [[Teviot pie]]!  Whilst not the least bit authentic, it was rather delicious.  The [[potato dumplings]] were rolled in [[yellow cornmeal]] and laid on the top of the locro and covered with slices of [[mozzarella cheese]].  This was oven baked for 30 minutes or so at 180\u00b0 C (350\u00b0 F - gas 4).\n===See also===\n* {{ChiliConCarne}}\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Ecuadorian recipes]]\n[[Category:Latin American recipes]]\n[[Category:Peruvian recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Soup and stock recipes]]\n[[Category:Beef recipes]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:Stews and casseroles]]\n[[Category:Favourite recipes]]\n[[Category:Pan fried]][[Category:Boiled or simmered]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#locro #potatodumplings #mozzarellacheese #sweetcorn #tinfoil #chorizo #beef #onions #tortillachips #tomatoes #yellowcornmeal </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
