This time I thought I would try jazzing up some supermarket packet [[Nuts|nuts]].  I love munching on the spices as much as the nuts themselves!\n\nI've used two tablespoons of [[Taste Sensation piri piri seasoning]].  You might try just one tablespoon to start with if you're not sure how hot you want them.  The [[Spice|spice]] mix is nice and subtle, not just heat.\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| 200 g pack of [[Hazelnuts|hazelnuts]]\n| 1 tablespoon of [[Butter|butter]] [[Ghee|ghee]] - normal butter or even [[Olive oil|olive oil]] would also be fine\n| 4 [[Cloves of Garlic, peeled and crushed|cloves of garlic, peeled and crushed]]\n| 1 tablespoon of [[Demerara sugar|demerara sugar]]\n| 2 tablespoons [[Taste Sensation piri piri seasoning]] Seasoning\n| &#189; teaspoon pink [[Sea Salt|sea salt]] - optional\n| A quick [[Spray|spray]] of [[Olive oil|olive oil]]\n}}\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Peri peri hazelnuts sauteeing.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Glazed with a spray of [[olive oil]]\nImage:Peri peri hazelnuts ingredients.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Peri Peri [[hazelnuts]], the basic ingredients\n</gallery>\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| Heat the [[Ghee|ghee]] or [[Butter|butter]] in a [[Wok|wok]] or pan being careful not to burn it\n| Have the [[Nut|nut]] ready to tip in to stop the [[Garlic|garlic]] cooking\n| Carefully sizzle the [[Crushed garlic|crushed garlic]] to remove as much of the water content. The moment the [[Garlic|garlic]] starts to colour, remove the pan and tip in the [[Hazelnuts|hazelnuts]] and stir well \n| Add the [[Sugar|sugar]], heat and stir until it melts, then sprinkle the remaining [[Spices|spices]], stir well and toss to mix everything together\n| You might want to add a quick [[Spray|spray]] of [[Olive oil|olive oil]] at the very end, just to gloss the [[Nuts|nuts]] so they look nice!\n}}\n\n===Chef's notes===\nAs raw products cooked with fresh [[Garlic|garlic]] don't keep too well and have the propensity to harbour nasty bacteria it's probably best to keep these in the [[Refrigerator|refrigerator]] and use them within a week or so.\n\nNot a problem for me as I don't suppose they'll survive the day!\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes from other sites]]\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Portuguese recipes]]\n[[Category:Accompaniments]]\n[[Category:Snacks and light bites]]\n[[Category:Spicy recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes]]\n[[Category:Chilli pepper recipes]]\n[[Category:Garlic recipes]]\n[[Category:Pan fried]]\n[[Category:Tapas, mezze and antipasti]]\n[[Category:Taste Sensation recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#oliveoil #garlic #hazelnuts #spray #nuts #butter #piripirihazelnuts #spices #ghee #wok #spice </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
