However the polenta is quite/very difficult to manage once cold and once the cold [[polenta]] has been broken it seems impossible to make a good seal.  Making these again, I think I would try to mould and quickly fill them whilst still warm.  I would also be inclined to add slightly more butter and oven cook them.\n===Comments from a visitor===\nI tried making the bulz ciobanesc with warm (nearly hot) polenta, rolled them in dried polenta and chilled them before cooking in the oven, they came out looking almost like the mythical ones. Very yummy, thanks for the recipe.\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes|Bulz ciobanesc (Dumplings with butter and cheese)]]\n[[Category:Romanian recipes|Bulz ciobanesc (Dumplings with butter and cheese)]]\n[[Category:Cheese recipes|Bulz ciobanesc (Dumplings with butter and cheese)]]\n[[Category:Snacks and light bites|Bulz ciobanesc (Dumplings with butter and cheese)]]\n[[Category:Starters|Bulz ciobanesc (Dumplings with butter and cheese)]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes|Bulz ciobanesc (Dumplings with butter and cheese)]]\n[[Category:Favourite recipes|Bulz ciobanesc (Dumplings with butter and cheese)]]\n[[Category:Boiled or simmered]]\n[[Category:Pan fried]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#butter #polenta #cheese #cream #cucumbers #accompaniment #parmesan #duck #bulzciobanesc #snack #polentacheesedumplings </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
