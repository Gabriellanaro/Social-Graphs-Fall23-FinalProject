Cooking and serving in separate dishes keeps all the gingery garlic butter on your plate, not left in the [[oven]].\n\nThis famous method of preparing chicken is probably not of Ukrainian origin as the name Kiev, the national capital, would imply, rather, the [[Russian]] food historian William Pokhlebkin claimed that [[Chicken]] Kiev was invented in the Moscow Merchants' Club in the early 20th century and was renamed Chicken Kiev (kotleta po-kievski lit. 'cutlet of/from Kiev') in one of the Soviet restaurants in later years.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 2 large [[Chicken|chicken]] breasts\n| 50 g [[Butter|butter]]\n| 1 tablespoon of freshly crushed [[garlic]]\n| 1 tablespoon of freshly grated [[ginger]] - [[Frozen ginger paste]] is easy to make and just as good.\n| 1 fresh green [[Indian chili]], finely chopped\n| [[Sea Salt|sea salt]] and [[Freshly ground black pepper|freshly ground black pepper]]\n| 1 [[egg]], beaten\n| 2 tbs plain flour, season with salt and pepper.  Try [[Old India Taco Seasoning]] or [[Tex-Mex seasoning]] for a change.\n| 120g fine [[Breadcrumbs|breadcrumbs]]\n| 2 small oven-proof serving bowls - The ones pictured came from Morrisons \n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Use softened [[Butter|butter]] or warm it in the [[Microwave|microwave]] for 15 seconds\n| Mix with the Crushed [[Garlic|garlic]], [[ginger]], chopped [[Indian chili]] and [[Salt|salt]] and [[Pepper|pepper]] until well combined\n| Shape into a [[Sausage|sausage]] and chill in the [[Refrigerator|refrigerator]] for a few hours, or even in the freezer for 15 minutes.\n| Carefully cut a pocket in each [[Chicken breast|chicken breast]] add the butter mixture. As the chicken will be cooked and maybe even served in the oven-proof bowls, it's not so important to ensure the butter does not 'escape' whilst cooking.\n| Setup the beaten eggs in one bowl, seasoned flour in another and [[Breadcrumbs|breadcrumbs]] in the last.\n| Dredge the chicken pieces in the seasoned flour, coat liberally in the egg wash and finally roll in the breadcrumbs.\n| Place the chicken pieces in the oven-proof dishes, pocket upwards.\n| Preheat the [[Oven|oven]] to 180\u00b0C (350\u00b0 F - gas 4 - Moderate/Medium hot)\n| [[Bake]] for 30 minutes\n}}\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Gingery chicken Kiev cooked.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Gingery chicken Kiev, cooked perfectly and all the butter saved in the serving bowl\nImage:Gingery chicken Kiev ready to cok.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Ready to cook\n</gallery>\n===Serving suggestion===\nServe with boiled [[potatoes]], [[carrots]] and [[steamed broccoli]].
