Making it this way, the nice garlicky [[Butter|butter]] stays in the chicken, not in the [[Baking tray|baking tray]].\n\nThis famous method of preparing chicken is probably not of Ukrainian origin as the name Kiev, the national capital, would imply, rather, the [[Russian]] food historian William Pokhlebkin claimed that [[Chicken]] Kiev was invented in the Moscow Merchants' Club in the early 20th century and was renamed Chicken Kiev (kotleta po-kievski lit. 'cutlet of/from Kiev') in one of the Soviet restaurants in later years.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 2 large [[Chicken|chicken]] breasts\n| 50 g [[Butter|butter]]\n| 4 [[Fat|fat]] [[Cloves of garlic crushed|cloves of garlic crushed]] (or to taste)\n| 2 tablespoons fresh [[Parsley|parsley]], finely chopped\n| [[Juice]] from half a [[Lemon|lemon]]\n| [[Sea Salt|sea salt]] and [[Freshly ground black pepper|freshly ground black pepper]]\n| 2 [[Egg yolks|egg yolks]]\n| 1 tablespoon [[Dijon Mustard|dijon mustard]]\n| 3 handfuls of fine [[Breadcrumbs|breadcrumbs]]\n| 1 tablespoon [[Sesame seeds|sesame seeds]] (optional)\n| A few shakes of [[Louisiana Hot Pepper Sauce|Louisiana hot pepper sauce]] or [[Tabasco sauce]]\n}}\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Spicy chicken Kiev cooked.jpg|Spicy chicken Kiev, cooked perfectly\nImage:Spicy chicken Kiev in foil.jpg|Sit each Kiev in a foil dish to retain all of the butter\nImage:Breaded chicken pieces ready to chill.jpg|Breaded chicken pieces and the chilled [[garlic butter]] slabs.

It therefore has to make exciting chicken, well, even more exciting!\n| Preheat the [[Oven|oven]] to 200\u00b0C (400\u00b0 F - gas 6 - Moderately hot)\n| When ready to cook, divide the chilled [[Butter|butter]] in two and place in each pocket.\n| Place the [[Chicken|chicken]], pocket upwards in its own 'dish' of [[Tin foil|tin foil]] and place these in a [[Baking tray|baking tray]]\n| [[Bake]] for 30 minutes\n}}\n===Serving suggestion===\nServe with [[baked potatoes]] and [[steamed broccoli]].\n==See also==\n* [[Gingery chicken Kiev]]\n* [[Chicken Kiev]]\n* {{See also - Jointing a chicken}}\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes|Chicken]]\n[[Category:Russian recipes|Chicken]]\n[[Category:Historic recipes|Chicken]]\n[[Category:Main courses|Chicken]]\n[[Category:Spicy recipes|Chicken]]\n[[Category:Garlic recipes|Chicken]]\n[[Category:Poultry recipes|Chicken]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#chicken #spicychickenkiev #butter #breadcrumbs #parsley #mustard #bakingtray #refrigerator #lemonjuice #eggyolks #sesameseeds </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
