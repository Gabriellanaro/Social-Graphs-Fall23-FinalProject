My first attempt was ruined because it was too salty.\n}}\n===Chef's notes===\nIf the allioli is too thick, add a teaspoon of water to loosen it.\n\nIt will probably be too runny if you use a large egg, so if you have no choice of size, use less of the white.  You can always add more if needed; you can't take it out afterwards though!\n\nThis can also be made in a [[Food processor|food processor]] with a blade attachment.\n\nIf you add the olive oil too quickly and the mixture separates into an oily mess, try the rescue method recommended by the award-winning Spanish chef, Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s: \"Measure out 1 tablespoon of lukewarm water and add to the mix little by little until you have the creamy sauce you wanted\".\n\nHaving tried the above suggestion a few times to no avail, I would suggest adding another whole fresh egg into the split mixture, maybe a dash of nice vinegar and just blitz for a minute or so.  You'll hear the difference as the curdled mixture starts to coagulate properly.  This ''fix'' has worked for me, every time.\n==See also==\n* A huge variety of [[Garlic mayonnaise recipes|different mayonnaise recipes]]\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Accompaniments]]\n[[Category:Dips and sauces]]\n[[Category:Egg recipes]]\n[[Category:Garlic recipes]]\n[[Category:Spanish recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes]]\n[[Category:Cookery cheats]]\n[[Category:Favourite recipes]]\n[[Category:Uncooked]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#alliolialamoderna #oliveoil #garlic #lemonjuice #foodprocessor #garlicmayonnaise #egg #garlicmayonnaiserecipes #spanish #unusualrecipes #vinegar </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
