Not having any of the aforementioned to [[Hand|hand]] I'm using [[Olive oil|olive oil]] and [[Butter|butter]] and I shall serve it with half a [[Crispy aromatic duck|crispy aromatic duck]] from our local [[Chinese wholesaler]]. Not entirely [[French]] then, but still delicious and a great basis for recipe customisation.\n\nThis can be made ahead of time and reheated in a [[Conventional oven|conventional oven]] or [[Microwave|microwave]].\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| 225 g [8 oz] [[Puy lentils]]\n| 1 [[Bouquet garni|bouquet garni]]\n| 1 teaspoon [[Sea Salt|sea salt]]\n| 1 small [[Onion|onion]], peeled and slashed halfway through and studded with 2 [[Clove buds|clove buds]]\n| 1 large [[Carrot|carrot]], peeled and cut into small cubes\n| 160 g [5.5 oz] cubed [[Smoked|smoked]] [[Pancetta|pancetta]]\n| 6 [[Cloves of Garlic, peeled and crushed|cloves of garlic, peeled and crushed]]\n| 1 large [[Onion|onion]], peeled and finely chopped\n| 4 tablespoons [[Olive oil|olive oil]]\n| 2 tablespoons of [[Butter|butter]]\n| Big handful of freshly chopped [[Parsley|parsley]]\n| Splash of [[White wine|white wine]] or [[Sherry|sherry]]\n| [[Sea Salt|sea salt]] and [[Freshly ground black pepper|freshly ground black pepper]]\n}}\n\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| Rinse the [[Lentils|lentils]] in a [[Sieve|sieve]] under cold running water\n| Pop the [[Lentils|lentils]] in a large pan, well covered with cold water and bring to the [[Boil|boil]]. Use filtered water if you are in a hard water area.\n| Immediately the water boils, remove from the heat and drain in a [[Colander|colander]], discarding the water.\n| Give the [[Saucepan|saucepan]] a wipe round add the [[Lentils|lentils]] and cover with 1 litre [1.24 [[Pints|pints]]] of cold water.\n| Sprinkle in 1 teaspoon of [[Sea Salt|sea salt]] and add the [[Clove|clove]] studded [[Onion|onion]], the [[Bouquet garni|bouquet garni]], half of the [[Crushed garlic|crushed garlic]] and the chopped [[Carrot|carrot]].\n| Bring to the [[Boil|boil]] and [[Simmer|simmer]] uncovered for 15 minutes, skimming any scum from the surface as required.  Check from time to time and top up with [[Boiling|boiling]] water if it's getting low.\n| Remove and drain, discarding the [[Clove|clove]]-studded [[Onion|onion]] and the [[Bouquet garni|bouquet garni]].\n| Heat a large [[Frying pan|frying pan]] or [[Wok|wok]] with a generous pinch of [[Black pepper|black pepper]], half of the [[Olive oil|olive oil]] and [[Fry|fry]] off half of the [[Pancetta|pancetta]] until it starts to [[Brown|brown]].\n| Add the chopped [[Onion|onion]] and cook gently for 10 minutes.\n| Add the remaining [[olive oil]] and the butter together with the remaining [[Bacon|bacon]] and cook slowly for another 5 minutes.\n| Add the chopped [[Garlic|garlic]] and [[Stir-fry|stir-fry]] for a few minutes.  Once it starts to take the slightest colour, stir in the [[Lentils|lentils]] and [[Carrots|carrots]].\n| Allow the [[Lentils|lentils]] to re-heat, stir in the chopped [[Parsley|parsley]], season and serve.\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nI've served this with half a [[Shredded|shredded]] [[Roasted|roasted]] [[Crispy duck|crispy duck]], which cooks from [[Frozen|frozen]] in about 40 minutes.  Delicious!\n===Variations===\nUse [[Duck fat|duck fat]] instead of [[Olive oil|olive oil]] if you can get it.\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:French recipes]]\n[[Category:Spanish recipes]]\n[[Category:Accompaniments]]\n[[Category:Snacks and light bites]]\n[[Category:Garlic recipes]]\n[[Category:Grain and bean recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegetable recipes]]\n[[Category:Pan fried]]\n[[Category:Boiled or simmered]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#oliveoil #onion #lentils #bouquetgarni #basquestylepuylentils #france #parsley #pancetta #butter #boil #duckfat </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
