There are many variations of this recipe so you can make it how you like so long as you use [[Potatoes|potatoes]] and mix with [[Mayonnaise|mayonnaise]] and [[Vegetables|vegetables]] ([[Carrots|carrots]] and [[Peas|peas]] being the more usual).\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 500 g mixed [[Potatoes|potatoes]] - I would suggest half King Edward and half Charlotte\n| 1 large [[Carrot|carrot]], [[Diced|diced]]\n| 125 g French or Kenyan [[Beans|beans]], chopped\n| 125 g [[garden peas]], [[Frozen|frozen]]\n| 1-2 [[Chopped red peppers|chopped red peppers]], depending on size\n| [[Garlic]] to taste, crushed\n| [[Mayonnaise]] to taste - or [[Allioli a la moderna|allioli a la moderna]] (in which case leave out the [[Garlic|garlic]])\n| Small handful of green, pitted [[Olives|olives]], chopped, but not too finely\n| 2-3 [[Gherkins|gherkins]]\n| 2 teaspoons [[Capers|capers]]\n| 2 [[Hard-boiled eggs|hard-boiled eggs]], roughly chopped\n| 130g tin of [[Tuna|tuna]] in [[Oil|oil]]\n| 4 slices of chopped [[Jam\u00f3n serrano]]\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Peel and [[Boil|boil]] the King Edwards and once cooked, [[Mash|mash]] them.\n| Scrape the Charlottes, cut into smallish [[Dice|dice]], and [[Boil|boil]] until tender.\n| [[Boil]] or [[Steam|steam]] the [[Carrot|carrot]], [[Beans|beans]], [[Peas and peppers|peas and peppers]].  Try not to over-cook them,  [[Al dente|al dente]] is ideal.\n| In a bowl, mix both types of [[Potato|potato]] with the [[Vegetables|vegetables]] and the [[Garlic|garlic]] if using. \n| Add the [[Mayonnaise|mayonnaise]] or ali-oli whilst the [[Vegetables|vegetables]] are still warm.  Do be liberal with it as you want to taste the mayonnaise.  Mix thoroughly.\n| Add the [[Olives|olives]], gherlins and [[Capers|capers]], mixing gently.\n| Serve in small dishes or on a large plate and garnish as desired with the [[Egg|egg]], tune and [[Jam\u00f3n serrano]].\n}}\n===Variations===\nOther suggested ingredients include [[Celery|celery]], \"reineta\" [[Apple|apple]] (Cox's [[Orange|orange]] pippin is about the nearest variety in the UK) and [[Nuts|nuts]].  Whatever you use, should be chopped quite small.  It is not vital to include the [[Garlic|garlic]], [[Capers|capers]] and [[Olives|olives]], if disliked.\n\nYou can also have make it with all [[Mashed|mashed]] or all cubed [[Potatoes|potatoes]], in which case, choose the appropriate [[Potato|potato]] type.\n===Chef's notes===\nIf you have the time and patience to make [[Allioli a la Catalana|allioli a la catalana]], then I feel it is better than plain [[Mayonnaise|mayonnaise]].  [[Allioli a la moderna|Allioli a la moderna]] is a perfectly acceptable substitute.  For the picture above, I used [[Not-for-wimps garlic mayonnaise|Not-for-wimps garlic mayonnaise]] which gives the salad a more yellow appearance due to the [[Rapeseed oil|rapeseed oil]] content.\n[[User:JuliaBalbilla|JuliaBalbilla]] \n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Egg recipes]]\n[[Category:Garlic recipes]]\n[[Category:Pork recipes]]\n[[Category:Salad recipes]]\n[[Category:Spanish recipes]]\n[[Category:Starters]]\n[[Category:Tapas, mezze and antipasti]]\n[[Category:Vegetable recipes]]\n[[Category:Boiled or simmered]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#mayonnaise #garlic #ensaladillarusa #olives #vegetables #capers #potatoes #boil #carrot #beans #potato </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
