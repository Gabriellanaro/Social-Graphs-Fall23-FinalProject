Don't be alarmed by the amount of [[Garlic|garlic]].\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 600 g [[Faba beans|faba beans]]\n| 100 ml extra virgin [[Olive oil|olive oil]], or as little as you need to cook the onions and garlic\n| 1-2 bulbs of [[Garlic|garlic]], separated and peeled, but not chopped\n| 1 large [[Onion|onion]], peeled and quartered\n| 1&frac12; [[Litres|litres]] [[Chicken stock|chicken stock]]\n| 4 [[Chorizo sausages|chorizo sausages]]\n| 2 [[morcilla]] sausages\n| 200 g [[pancetta]] - this should be in a whole piece and not sliced\n| 1&frac12; teaspoons sweet [[Paprika|paprika]], either [[Smoked|smoked]] or unsmoked\n| A few strands of [[Saffron|saffron]], crushed\n| Finely chopped [[Parsley|parsley]]\n}}\n\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Soak the [[Beans|beans]] overnight.  Drain and rinse.\n| Heat the [[Oil|oil]] in a large saucepan and gently [[Fry|fry]] the [[Garlic|garlic]] and [[Onions|onions]] until they are slightly golden.\n| Add the [[Sausages|sausages]], pancetta,  [[Beans|beans]] and [[Chicken stock|chicken stock]] to the saucepan.\n| Cook slowly and when it starts to foam, add the [[Paprika|paprika]] and [[Saffron|saffron]].\n| Continue cooking slowly for about two and a half hours, checking regularly that the saucepan is not running out of liquid.  Add more water as and when necessary, making sure that the [[Beans|beans]] are covered at all times.\n| Remove from the heat and let it stand until cool.\n| Remove the [[Sausages|sausages]] and pancetta, cut them into 1 cm pieces and return them to the pan.\n| Reheat and serve in bowls, sprinkled with the [[Parsley|parsley]].\n}}\n===Variations===\nIf you particularly like [[morcilla]], you can substitute an extra one for one of the chorizos.  Pieces of [[Pork|pork]] shoulder can be included as well.\n\n===Chef's tip===\nTry to get \"fabas a la granja\" which are obtainable from specialist [[Spanish]] food shops.  If you really cannot get them, then use white [[Kidney|kidney]] or [[Haricot beans|haricot beans]], although their texture is not the same.\n\nPancetta is widely available, but it must be a whole piece.  Substitute it with a piece of streaky [[Bacon|bacon]] if you can only find sliced pancetta.  The chorizos and morcillas should be slightly larger than a thick British sausage.\n\nFor those watching their weight or health, please be warned that this dish is rather fatty.  The [[morcilla]], especially, can shrink to almost half its uncooked size.  Although not authentic, you could grill the sausages first to reduce the amount of fat and drain off the olive oil once the onions and garlic are golden.\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes|Fabada asturiana]]\n[[Category:Garlic recipes|Fabada asturiana]]\n[[Category:Main courses|Fabada asturiana]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes|Fabada asturiana]]\n[[Category:Pork recipes|Fabada asturiana]]\n[[Category:Spanish recipes|Fabada asturiana]]\n[[Category:Stews and casseroles|Fabada asturiana]]\n[[Category:Stewed, braised or pot roasted]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#fabadaasturiana #morcilla #beans #garlic #chickenstock #paprika #saffron #parsley #sausages #pork #oliveoil </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
