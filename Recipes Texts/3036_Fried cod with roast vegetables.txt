However, you should bear in mind that different [[Vegetables|vegetables]] require different [[Cooking times|cooking times]].\n===Chef's notes===\nI used Mayan Gold [[Potatoes|potatoes]] because they look attractive [[Roasted|roasted]] unpeeled and are generally smallish.  Another good [[Potato|potato]] to use is Highland Burgundy Red which is also small.  However, use any suitable potato breed you desire, as long as they are chopped up small.\n\nAs for [[Garlic|garlic]], I would recommend very [[Fat|fat]] [[Cloves|cloves]].  If yours are not very big, add them at the same time as the [[Peppers|peppers]].\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes|Cod with roast vegetables]]\n[[Category:Main courses|Cod with roast vegetables]]\n[[Category:Fish recipes|Cod with roast vegetables]]\n[[Category:Garlic recipes|Cod with roast vegetables]]\n[[Category:Sea fish recipes|Cod with roast vegetables]]\n[[Category:Spanish recipes|Cod with roast vegetables]]\n[[Category:Vegetable recipes|Cod with roast vegetables]]\n[[Category:Pan fried]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#fish #garlic #vegetables #sherry #potatoes #friedcodwithroastvegetables #peppers #leeks #butter #flour #roasted </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
