It is delicious as a winter warmer and helps to fight off colds and flu'.  In southern Spain it is sometimes described as Ajo Blanco, not to be confused with cold [[Ajo Blanco Malague\u00f1o|ajo blanco Malague\u00f1o]].\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 3 tablespoons [[Olive oil|olive oil]]\n| 4 bulbs [[Garlic|garlic]], peeled and either left whole, or sliced\n| 2 teaspoons [[Smoked|smoked]] sweet [[Paprika|paprika]]\n| 1&frac12; [[Litres|litres]] [[Vegetable stock|vegetable stock]]\n| 8 slices of French [[Bread|bread]]\n| A few small sprigs of [[Thyme|thyme]]\n| 1 [[Bay leaf|bay leaf]]\n| 4 [[free range eggs]]\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Heat the [[Oil|oil]] in a largish saucepan on a medium heat.\n| When hot, add the whole or chopped [[Garlic|garlic]].\n| Once the [[Garlic|garlic]] is golden [[Brown|brown]], remove from heat.  If you are using whole [[Cloves|cloves]], then blend them with a little of the [[Stock|stock]]. Set aside.\n| Return pan to the heat and add the [[Paprika|paprika]], allowing to [[Stew|stew]] for a minute or two.\n| If you have blended the [[Garlic|garlic]], return the mixture to the pan after the [[Paprika|paprika]] has been cooked.   \n| Add the remaining [[Stock|stock]], [[Bread|bread]] slices and the [[Herbs|herbs]].\n| Cover and  allow to [[Simmer|simmer]] for 15-20 minutes.\n| Remove the [[Herbs|herbs]],\n| Beat the [[Eggs|eggs]] and pour some of the [[Soup|soup]] into a bowl.\n| Spoon the beaten [[Egg|egg]] into the bowl and when it has started to solidify, gently pour the contents of the bowl bag into the saucepan,\n| Reheat slightly, but do not [[Boil|boil]],\n| Serve in bowls, being careful not to break up the [[Egg|egg]] too much.\n}}\n===Variations===\nFor extra warmth, use hot [[Smoked paprika|smoked paprika]] instead of sweet.  I tend to add about 4-5 teaspoons.\n\nUse as much or as little [[Garlic|garlic]] as you like, but you should be able to taste it.\n\nTry grating some [[cheese]] over the top of each bowl. In Sevilla. the [[eggs]] are poached an floated in each bowl on a largish slice of fried bread.\n\nA Madrid version is to include 250 g of chopped [[tomatoes]] and to place bread slices and whole [[eggs]] into a casserole dish, the soup being carefully poured over it once it is cooked.  You then [[bake]] the whole thing in the  oven at 400C/200F/Gas 6 until the eggs are set.  This should take about 5 - 10 minutes. \n===Chef's notes===\nAlthough this does not taste as strongly of [[Garlic|garlic]] as one would imagine, for a much milder version use whole Cloves of [[Garlic|garlic]] and omit the blending stage.  You can then remove and discard the [[Cloves|cloves]] once the [[Soup|soup]] has finished cooking.  \n--[[User:JuliaBalbilla|JuliaBalbilla]] 01:32, 5 January 2009 (UTC)\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Egg recipes]]\n[[Category:Garlic recipes]]\n[[Category:Soup and stock recipes]]\n[[Category:Spanish recipes]]\n[[Category:Starters]]\n[[Category:Vegetable recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes]]\n[[Category:Boiled or simmered]]\n[[Category:Pan fried]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#garlic #paprika #eggs #soup #stock #egg #bread #herbs #litres #simmer #vegetablestock </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
