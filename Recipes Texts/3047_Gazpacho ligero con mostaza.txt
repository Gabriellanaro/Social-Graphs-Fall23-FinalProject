Another good excuse to use your [[tomato press]].\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 1 kg ripe [[Tomatoes, peeled|tomatoes, peeled]]\n| 4 tender [[Celery leaves|celery leaves]], or 1 stick [[Celery|celery]]\n| [[Garlic]], to taste\n| [[Salt]] and [[Pepper|pepper]]\n| 1 teaspoon [[Mustard|mustard]], or to taste (see Chef's notes below)\n| 45 ml [[Olive oil|olive oil]]\n| 15 ml [[White wine vinegar|white wine vinegar]]\n| 1 litre water, light [[Vegetable stock|vegetable stock]], or freshly pressed [[Tomato juice|tomato juice]] (shop [[Juice|juice]] is too heavy)\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Place all of the ingredients except the water/[[Stock|stock]] in a [[Blender|blender]] and process until smooth.\n| Pour into a serving bowl and stir in the water, [[Stock|stock]] or [[Tomato juice|tomato juice]].\n| Refrigerate until chilled and garnish with chopped [[celery]] leaves.\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe, garnished with chopped [[celery]] leaves. \n===Chef's notes===\nThis will keep in the [[Fridge|fridge]] for 1 day, but can be [[Frozen|frozen]] for up to 3 months.\n\nRegarding [[Mustard|mustard]].  The [[Spanish]] have phrases for [[French]], English and [[wholegrain]] [[Mustards|mustards]], so I assume that when they say just 'mustard' that it refers to their everyday variety, which apparently is a classic American style [[mustard]].  They also have a brand called 'Louit' who make various mustards, including a American one which is the bright yellow stuff used for hot dogs.  I have never tried American [[mustard]] and understand it is fairly mild.  Personally I would suggest that UK readers try [[English mustard]] if you want something with a little more heat than the American variety.  Of course, you can use any [[mustard]] you like!  I used ground [[mustard]] powder.\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes|Gazpacho ligero con mostaza]]\n[[Category:Garlic recipes]]\n[[Category:Soup and stock recipes|Gazpacho ligero con mostaza]]\n[[Category:Spanish recipes|Gazpacho ligero con mostaza]]\n[[Category:Starters|Gazpacho ligero con mostaza]]\n[[Category:Vegan recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegetable recipes|Gazpacho ligero con mostaza]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes|Gazpacho ligero con mostaza]]\n[[Category:Uncooked]]\n\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#gazpacholigeroconmostaza #mustard #celery #tomatojuice #stock #mustards #celeryleaves #wholegrain #juice #whitewinevinegar #tomatopress </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
