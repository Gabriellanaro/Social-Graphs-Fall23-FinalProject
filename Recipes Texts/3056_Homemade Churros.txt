It is sometimes referred to as a Spanish doughnut or Mexican doughnut. The snack gets its name from its shape, which resembles the horns of the Churro breed of sheep reared in the Spanish grasslands of Huarocho. There are two types of churros in Spain. One is long and fat and the other, specially popular in Madrid, is thin and knotted (porra). They both are normally eaten for breakfast dipped in hot chocolate (drink).\nThe churro is typically fried to a crunchy consistency and sometimes sprinkled with [[sugar]]. Its surface is ridged due to being piped from a [[churrera]], a syringe with a star-shaped nozzle.\n\nLike [[pretzels]], churros are often sold by street vendors who in many cases will fry them freshly on the street stand and sell them hot. In Spain and Mexico, they are available in cafes for breakfast, although they may be found throughout the day and night as a snack.\n\nVery popular for breakfast, churros are a simple type of doughnut.  They can be made with a [[churrera]], obtainable from [http://www.delicioso.co.uk/ Delicioso] and [[Orce Serrano Hams]].\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| Measuring in a [[cup or jug]], you need equal volumes of [[Plain flour|plain flour]] and water, so for this recipe measure 500 ml of both\n| Large pinch of [[Salt|salt]]\n| [[Olive]] or [[Sunflower oil|sunflower oil]]\n| Caster or [[Icing sugar|icing sugar]] (optional)\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Put the water and [[Salt|salt]] in a saucepan and bring to the [[Boil|boil]].\n| [[Sieve]] the [[Flour|flour]] into a bowl.\n| Add the [[Boiling|boiling]] water to the [[Flour|flour]] and mix thoroughly with a fork.  The mixture should be like a thick paste.\n| Do not worry too much about any lumps as the force on the churrera will disperse them.\n| Heat the [[Oil|oil]] in a large [[Deep frying|deep frying]] or saut\u00e9 pan.\n| Force the mixture into the [[churrera]] as tightly as you can, to reduce the amount of air in the mixture.\n| When the [[Oil|oil]] is almost [[Smoking|smoking]], pipe the dough into the pan, either in a spiral or in longish strips.  \n| Cook until they are a rich golden [[Brown|brown]].  Because they float, you will need to turn them over to ensure even cooking.  This is best done with either [[skewers]] or chopsticks.\n| If they are spiral shaped, cut them into long pieces with scissors.\n| Sprinkle them with [[Sugar|sugar]] if desired\n}}\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Churros ready to be frozen.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Churros ready to be frozen\nImage:Cooked, frozen, home-made churros.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Home-made, frozen and cooked churros\n</gallery>\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe hot with a cup of thick dark drinking [[Chocolate|chocolate]] into which the churros are dunked.  Unless you have quite a sweet tooth, I would avoid sprinkling them with the [[Sugar|sugar]].\n\nThis recipe makes 10 large churros.  Allow 2-3 per person.\n\n===Variations===\nThe above is a very basic recipe and in my experience the more usual one.  However, sometimes [[Potatoes|potatoes]] and/or [[Eggs|eggs]] are included.\n\nAlthough they would lose their authenticity, you can play around with them and add any flavourings you like.  I have made them with [[Garlic|garlic]] and [[Paprika|paprika]] before.\n\n===Chef's tip===\nYou can use a [[deep fat fryer]] to cook the churros, but it is quite difficult to pipe in the mixture if your fryer is a long thin one.  They would probably work better in a round fryer.\n\nAs an alternative to a [[churrera]], it is possible to make them using a [[piping bag]] with a large star-shaped nozzle, although not quite so easy.\n\nChurros can be [[Frozen|frozen]].  Pipe them onto [[greaseproof paper]], or preferably [[Bake-O-Glide]] - it can be quite tricky extracting them from [[greaseproof paper]]. [[Open freeze]] them until they are hard (several hours), then put them into bags.  They should be cooked directly from [[frozen]].  If they are [[frozen]], they are easier to cook in a [[deep fat fryer]].\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes|Churros]]\n[[Category:Bread and baking|Churros]]\n[[Category:Spanish recipes|Churros]]\n[[Category:Mexican recipes|Churros]]\n[[Category:Latin American recipes|Churros]]\n[[Category:Snacks and light bites|Churros]]\n[[Category:Breakfast recipes]]\n[[Category:Deep fried]]\n[[Category:Cuban recipes]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#churrera #frozen #homemadechurros #greaseproofpaper #deepfatfryer #flour #icingsugar #boiling #potato #orceserranohams #cuporjug </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
