The burgers would go well with [[Molletes antequeranos (Antequera muffins)|Molletes antequeranos]] and salad as a [[light lunch]].\n===Variations===\nVary the amount of [[Garlic|garlic]] and Piment\u00f3 de La Vera.  Use [[Fennel seeds|fennel seeds]] instead of [[Cumin|cumin]] and experiment with different [[Herbs|herbs]].\n===Chef's notes===\nEnsure that they are properly cooked.  The [[Sausages|sausages]] can also be consumed cold.  We used locally produced [[Traditionally Farmed Gloucestershire Old Spot Pork|Gloucester Old Spot pork]].\n\nAlthough these are ready 1 1 hour, they need at least 24 hours to be at their best.\n\nFollow the [[RSPCA Think Pig Checklist]] to make sure that your [[Pork|pork]] has come from pigs that have been reared to higher welfare standards.\n* http://bit.ly/rspcathinkpig\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes|Chorizo]]\n[[Category:Spanish recipes|Chorizo]]\n[[Category:Breakfast recipes|Chorizo]]\n[[Category:Main courses|Chorizo]]\n[[Category:Snacks and light bites|Chorizo]]\n[[Category:Spicy recipes|Chorizo]]\n[[Category:Tapas, mezze and antipasti|Chorizo]]\n[[Category:Garlic recipes|Chorizo]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes|Chorizo]]\n[[Category:Pork recipes|Chorizo]]\n[[Category:Cooking with wine|Chorizo]]\n[[Category:Pan fried]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#sausages #burgers #ground #garlic #flour #driedoregano #fridge #pork #homemadechorizosausagesandburgers #oliveoil #chorizosausages </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
