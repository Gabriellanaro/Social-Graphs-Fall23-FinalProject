(It's quite ok to eat liver rare)\n| Reserve the [[liver and onions]] and keep warm\n| Deglaze the pan with the [[sherry vinegar]] by bringing it to the [[boil]] whilst stirring.  Reduce the heat and [[simmer]] for a minute\n| Pour the hot [[sherry]] over the liver and sprinkle with the remaining [[parsley]]\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\n\nServe hot\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:Spanish recipes]]\n[[Category:Offal recipes]]\n[[Category:Pan fried]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#sherryvinegar #parsley #fry #liverwithherbsandsherryvinegar #sage #butter #boil #panfried #redwinevinegar #simmer #onions </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
