Tasty, juicy and simple!</span>\n\n<span class=\"reviewAuthor\"> [[User:Chef|Jerry]] </span></span>\n}}\nHow long does it take to cook [[Gammon|gammon]] in a [[Pressure cooker|pressure cooker]]?\n\nI see lots of differing [[Information|information]] for this; most of it far too complicated.  If you want tasty flavourful [[Gammon|gammon]] that can be 'carved' by pushing a spoon on to it, then the answer is simple: 1 hour at full pressure and allow the [[Pressure cooker|pressure cooker]] to depressurise naturally.\n\nThis simple formula works for most [[Gammon|gammon]] joints between 1kg & 1.8kg; the standard size for rolled gammon.\n\nIf your joint is smaller, cook it for 45 minutes.  That's the answer!\n\nTo add a little extra flavour I've used some [[Citrus fruits|citrus fruits]] and [[Herbs|herbs]].  It was delicious, moist and extremely tasty!\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| 1.6 kg rolled [[Gammon joint|gammon joint]], rind removed\n| 2 [[Oranges|oranges]]\n| 1 [[Grapefruit|grapefruit]]\n| Big bunch of [[Sage|sage]]\n| Sprig of [[Thyme|thyme]]\n| Good pinch of [[Freshly ground black pepper|freshly ground black pepper]]\n}}\n\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| Put the [[Fresh herbs|fresh herbs]] into the [[Cooker|cooker]].\n| Put the pot stand in the [[Pressure cooker|pressure cooker]] and fill with a couple of inches of hot water, so the inner pot is just above the water level.\n| Cut the [[Grapefruit|grapefruit]] into enough slices to line the base of the inner pot.\n| Remove all of the plastic wrapping from the [[Gammon joint|gammon joint]], if applicable.\n| Sit the joint on top of the [[Grapefruit|grapefruit]] slices.\n| Cut the [[Oranges|oranges]] into halves and surround the [[Gammon|gammon]] with them.\n| Sprinkle everything with a good amount of [[Black pepper|black pepper]].\n| Close the [[Pressure cooker|pressure cooker]], bring to full pressure and cook for one hour.\n| Allow to depressurise naturally.\n}}\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Bunch_of_herbs_in_pressure_cooker.jpg|Put a big bunch of herbs in the base of the pressure cooker\nImage:Gammon_joint_on_grapefruit_slices.jpg|Sit the gammon joint on slices of grapefruit\nImage:Cooking gammon in a pressure cooker recipe.jpg|Surround the gammon joint with citrus fruit\nImage:Gammon_joint_pressure_cooked_in_one_hour.jpg|Pressure cooked ham cooking for one hour\nImage:The_gammon_falls_apart_after_cooking.jpg|The joint of gammon just falls apart; perfectly cooked\nImage:Pressure_cooked_gammon.jpg|Perfectly cooked in 1 hour, tender and juicy and carved with a spoon!\n</gallery>\n\n===Serving suggestions===\nGreat as a '[[Roast|roast]]' dinner, and fantastic served cold, as a [[Salad|salad]].\n===Variations===\nI noticed that black pepper sprinkled over the gammon joint at the start of cooking remained until the very end.  On that basis, it would be pefectly possible to roll the ham joint in flavourings before cooking which would give you a lovely flavoured outside.  Will try this soon!\n===Chef's notes===\nNote to self: With this amount of water, electric hob setting 9 is fine to bring to pressure without burning the contents. [[Hob]] setting 5 keeps the [[Pressure cooker|pressure cooker]] on full pressure without any [[Steam|steam]] escaping.\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Danish recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:Pork recipes]]\n[[Category:Pressure cooker recipes]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:12032020'>#pressurecooker #gammon #grapefruit #oranges #gammonjoint #cookinggammoninapressurecooker #pressurecookerrecipes #porkrecipes #recipes #meatrecipes #citrusfruits</code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
