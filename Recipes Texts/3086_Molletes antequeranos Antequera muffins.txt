They are eaten at breakfast and throughout the day as a snack.  Similar versions of molletes are found throughout southern Spain.\n\nWhilst the serving suggestion I have given is typical, you can basically do what you want with them.\n\n\n'''1st dough (Masa madre):'''\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 100 g [[Strong flour|strong flour]] \n| 50 ml  warm water \n| 1 x 7 g sachet of [[Dried yeast|dried yeast]] (use easy blend [[Yeast|yeast]] if making in a [[Breadmaker|breadmaker]]) or 15 g fresh yeast \n}}\n \n'''2nd dough: '''\n{{RecipeIngredientsNB\n| 500 g [[Strong flour|strong flour]] \n| 320 ml  warm water \n| 1 x 7 g sachet of [[Dried yeast|dried yeast]] (use easy blend [[Yeast|yeast]] if making in a [[Bread maker|bread maker]]) or 15 g fresh yeast \n| 50 ml [[Olive|olive]] or [[Sunflower oil|sunflower oil]]. \n| 2 teaspoons [[Salt|salt]]\n}}\n===Method===\n\n'''To make the 1st dough: '''\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Place the [[Yeast|yeast]] in the water and if using fresh or normal [[Dried yeast|dried yeast]], allow to [[Ferment|ferment]].\n| Add the water and the [[Yeast|yeast]] to the [[Flour|flour]] and form the dough into a ball.\n| Cut a cross on the top of the ball and place in a bowl of warm water.  The water should cover the dough and then cover the bowl with a piece of [[cling-film]]. \n| Once the dough has risen to the top of the bowl (about 10 minutes), use immediately. \n}}\n'''  To make the molletes:'''\n{{RecipeMethod\n| From the 2nd dough ingredients, add the [[Yeast|yeast]] to the water, allowing to [[Ferment|ferment]] if necessary.\n| Add the [[Oil|oil]] and mix. Then add half the [[Flour|flour]] mixed with the [[Salt|salt]] and mix again\n| Next, add the 1st dough, together with the remaining 2nd dough [[Flour|flour]] and [[Kneading bread|knead]] for at least 10 minutes.  If using a machine, [[Kneading bread|knead]] until the dough is smooth and elastic. \n| Place the dough in a bowl, cover with a damp [[Tea|tea]]-towel and allow to rise in a [[warm place]] until it is double its size.  \n| Punch the dough well and divide into about 6 pieces.  Shape each piece into a sort of elongated ball place on a greased [[Baking|baking]] sheet until they have doubled in size.  This could take several hours or even overnight as there is no sugar to encourage the yeast to work.\n| Preheat the oven to 250 C/475 F/Gas 9 and placing a bowl of water in the bottom before switching on.\n| If you wish, you can lightly dust the molletes with [[Flour|flour]].\n| Once heated, put them into the oven and immediately reduce the temperature to 200 C/400 F/Gas 6 and [[Bake|bake]] for around 20 minutes.  \n| 5 minutes before the end of [[Baking|baking]], spray the molletes with water.\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nLightly toast them and paint with [[Garlic|garlic]]-infused [[Olive oil|olive oil]] or melted [[lard]].  Add [[Grated|grated]] [[Tomato|tomato]] (minus the skin) and chopped Serrano or Ib\u00e9rico [[Ham|ham]].  Use more [[Oil|oil]] if desired.  Similarly, they can be used to make a form of the Mallorqu\u00edn [[Pa amb oli]] or the Catal\u00e1n [[Pa amb tom\u00e0quet]].  I like them with what I call 'cheats' [[Pa amb tom\u00e0quet|'cheats' Pa amb tom\u00e0quet]] or [[Tomate frito]].\n===Chef's notes===\nYou will probably need to use two baking trays with 3 molletes on each as they spread.  Also use the shallowest trays you have otherwise the undersides of the molletes may be still slightly doughy.  If you only have deepish trays, then after the normal cooking time, turn over the molletes and put them back into the oven for a few minutes.\n\nIt is impossible to make the dough entirely in a [[breadmaker]].  Loathe as I am to create washing-up, I decided to make them a second time using the [[food processor]] until both doughs were mixed.  I then transferred it to the [[breadmaker]] for the final kneading and first rising.  This saves standing over the [[food processor]] whilst it is kneading the dough.\n==See also==\n* [[Molletes antequeranos (Antequera muffins)]]\n* [[Eggs Benedict]]\n* [[Breakfast muffins]]\n* [[Philadelphia breakfast muffins]]\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes|Molletes]]\n[[Category:Bread and baking|Molletes]]\n[[Category:Breakfast recipes]]\n[[Category:Spanish recipes|Molletes]]\n[[Category:Snacks and light bites|Molletes]][[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#yeast #flour #breadmaker #driedyeast #baking #foodprocessor #kneadingbread #ferment #strongflour #unusualrecipes #ham </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
