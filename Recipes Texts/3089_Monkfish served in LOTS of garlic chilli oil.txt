Because of all the lovely [[Garlic|garlic]] and [[Chilli|chilli]] flavoured [[Oil|oil]], it tempts you to eat far too much [[Bread|bread]]. Increase or reduce the garlic and chilli to taste. 1 bulb of garlic and 3 chillies is my personal choice.\n\nGood fresh [[ciabatta bread]] is an essential [[Accompaniment|accompaniment]] to this dish.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| 260 g skinned [[monkfish]] tail chopped into bite sized pieces (about the same size as large prawns)\n| 125 ml [[Extra virgin olive oil|extra virgin olive oil]]\n| A pinch of freshly ground [[black pepper]]\n| 3 small dried red [[chillies]], such as [[bird eye chillies]]\n| &#189; teaspoon [[Sea Salt|sea salt]]\n| 1 bulb of [[garlic]] broken into cloves, peeled and sliced\n| The zest and juice of 1 fresh [[lime]]\n}}\n\n===[[Mise en place]]===\nThe [[monkfish]] tail has just one gelatinous bone down the centre, similar to [[rock salmon]] or [[dogfish]].  Running a sharp knife along the bone will separate the meat fairly easily.  Just check that there are no pin-[[bones]] left where the fins have been poorly trimmed.\n\nPop the [[monkfish]] chunks into a [[Lock and Lock]] box together with the juice and zest of a [[lime]].  Shake well and store in the fridge for at least an hour.\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| Add a pinch of [[black pepper]] and the [[olive oil]] to a small pan and heat over a medium flame. Not too hot, burnt [[Garlic|garlic]] is nasty.\n| Add \u00bd a teaspoon of salt to the oil and then add the [[Dried Chillies|dried chillies]] and the sliced [[Garlic|garlic]] and let it sizzle.\n| Drain the lime juice from the [[monkfish]] pieces and discard it. \n| The very second you see the [[garlic]] take the slightest colour, carefully add all of the [[monkfish]] pieces.\n| Cook for 3 minutes being careful not to overcook the garlic.  You want it soft and juicy, not crisp and dry.\n| Allow the oil to cool a little, then pour the contents of the pan into a pre-warmed [[Oven|oven]]-proof dish and serve from the pan on a wooden board\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nSprinkle the chopped [[thyme]] over the slices of [[ciabatta bread]] and serve this with [[Lemon wedges|lemon wedges]]\n===Recipe source===\n\n* Inspired by a glorious Menorcan holiday\n===Variations===\nMy preference for the [[chillies]] is to use 3 large dried [[Chile de Arbole]], cut into small pieces.  This way, the oil gets properly flavoured and you have lots of lovely garlic flavoured chillies to eat - I do like my chillies to have a little bite!\n==See also==\n* [[Gambas al Ajillo]]\n* [[Menorcan garlic prawns]]\n* [[Monkfish and prawns with garlic, chilli and ginger]]\n{{Template:PeelingGinger}}\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Spanish recipes]]\n[[Category:Accompaniments]]\n[[Category:Snacks and light bites]]\n[[Category:Spicy recipes]]\n[[Category:Starters]]\n[[Category:Tapas, mezze and antipasti]]\n[[Category:Chilli pepper recipes]]\n[[Category:Fish recipes]]\n[[Category:Sea fish recipes]]\n[[Category:Pan fried]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#monkfish #garlic #lime #menorcangarlicprawns #chillies #blackpepper #ciabattabread #monkfishservedinlotsofgarlicchillioil #bread #chilli #driedchillies </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
