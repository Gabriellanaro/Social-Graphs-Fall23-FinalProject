At one end, loop an extra piece of string through to allow the [[Sausages|sausages]] to hang.\n| Tie an extra piece of string around the middle of each roll so that you get a link of two.\n| Place on a flat surface, such as a tray or [[Baking|baking]] tin and put in [[Freezer|freezer]] for 30 minutes.  This will [[Help|help]] the morcillas to bond.\n| Bring the [[Onion|onion]] water to the [[Boil|boil]] and add the morcillas.  Add extra water to cover and [[Salt|salt]] if necessary,\n| Reduce heat and [[Simmer|simmer]] for 30-40 minutes.\n| Remove the morcillas from the pan, drain and allow to hang in a cool larder for several hours.\n| Release them from the [[Butter|butter]] muslin and keep in the [[Fridge|fridge]] in a container for up to 4 days.\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nThe [[Sausages|sausages]] are best sliced and [[Fried|fried]], rather than eaten whole, in the same way that an English [[black-pudding]] would be used.\n===Variations===\nYou can vary the amount of [[Garlic|garlic]] and [[Spices|spices]] and use ordinary [[Paprika|paprika]] if you wish.  If you can get it, use the [[Pork|pork]] of an Ib\u00e9rico breed of [[Pig|pig]].  The cloves are quite powerful so you may wish to reduce the quantity.\n===Chef's notes===\nYou need to be very careful when cutting the string and unrolling the morcillas.  Use very sharp, fine scissors (such as embroidery scissors) and unroll very slowly and carefully.  Keep them on a flat surface whilst doing this, or they will break. \n{{Template:ThinkPig}}\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes|Morcilla blanca]]\n[[Category:Garlic recipes]]\n[[Category:Pork recipes|Morcilla blanca]]\n[[Category:Snacks and light bites|Morcilla blanca]]\n[[Category:Spanish recipes|Morcilla blanca]]\n[[Category:Spicy recipes|Morcilla blanca]]\n[[Category:Starters|Morcilla blanca]]\n[[Category:Boiled or simmered]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#morcillablanca #rice #bayleaves #stock #sausages #ham #boil #butter #ground #oregano #onion </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
