In Spain, [[Vegetables|vegetables]] are usually served as a separate course. \n \nThis recipe is from the Pais Vasco (Basque) region.\n\nChoose at least 5 or 6 varieties of [[Vegetables|vegetables]] from the following, depending on what is in season:\n{{RecipeIngredients \n| 1 [[Cauliflower|cauliflower]]\n| 1 white [[Cabbage|cabbage]]\n| 4 [[Carrots|carrots]]\n| 8 [[Artichoke hearts|artichoke hearts]]\n| 8 spears white [[Asparagus|asparagus]]\n| 8 medium [[Potatoes|potatoes]]\n| 400 g [[garden peas]], shelled\n| 200 g [[Broad beans|broad beans]], shelled\n| 200 g [[French beans]]\n| 4 [[Tomatoes|tomatoes]]\n| 2 large [[Leeks|leeks]]\n| 2 [[Swiss chard]]\n}} \nAlso:\n{{RecipeIngredientsNB\n| [[Olive oil]] to taste\n| [[Garlic]] to taste, chopped\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Wash your chosen [[Vegetables|vegetables]] and peel if necessary.\n| Slice, chop or shred the [[Vegetables|vegetables]] as appropriate.\n| [[Boil]] or [[Steam|steam]] them in separate saucepans, except for the [[Tomatoes|tomatoes]] which should be [[Grilled|grilled]].  As some [[Vegetables|vegetables]] take longer than others, you will need to work out which ones need to go on first.\n| Towards the end of the cooking time, put some [[Olive oil|olive oil]] in a pan and gently [[Fry|fry]] the [[Garlic|garlic]] until it is golden.\n| Drain the [[Vegetables|vegetables]] and arrange them separately on a large serving plate, or on four individual plates.\n| Drizzle the [[Garlic|garlic]] and [[Oil|oil]] over the top of the [[Vegetables|vegetables]] and serve.\n}}\n===Variations===\nYou can [[Baked potatoes|bake the potatoes]] if you wish and arrange the other [[Vegetables|vegetables]] around them.\n\nThe amount of [[Oil|oil]] you use will depend on which [[Vegetables|vegetables]] you have chosen, eg. [[Potatoes|potatoes]] will absorb more oil than [[Peas|peas]].\n===Chef's notes===\nIf for some reason, your [[Vegetables|vegetables]] become cold, you can heat them gently in the [[Microwave|microwave]], but do so before you add the [[Oil|oil]] and [[Garlic|garlic]].\n--[[User:JuliaBalbilla|JuliaBalbilla]] 07:11, 4 February 2009 (UTC)\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes|Vegetables mixed]]\n[[Category:Accompaniments|Vegetables mixed]]\n[[Category:Garlic recipes|Vegetables mixed]]\n[[Category:Spanish recipes|Vegetables mixed]]\n[[Category:Starters|Vegetables mixed]]\n[[Category:Vegetable recipes|Vegetables mixed]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes|Vegetables mixed]]\n[[Category:Vegan recipes|Vegetables mixed]]\n[[Category:Boiled or simmered]]\n[[Category:Pan fried]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#vegetables #garlic #tomatoes #oliveoil #potatoes #fry #grilled #peas #cabbage #broadbeans #frenchbeans </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
