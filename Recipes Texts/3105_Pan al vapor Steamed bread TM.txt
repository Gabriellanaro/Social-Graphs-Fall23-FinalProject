It is meant for [[Toasting|toasting]].\n\nThe recipe comes from '''[http://www.clubcocinafacil.com/masas-bases/PAN-AL-VAPOR_2489.html ClubCocinaFacil]''' - the recipe below has one more rising than the original.  You can also see a video on their website.  It is in Spanish but you will get the general idea.\n\nSee '''Variations''' below for how to convert this recipe for [[Steaming|steaming]] conventionally.\n\n{{RecipeIngredientsTM\n| 150g water\n| 15g fresh or 7g [[Dried yeast|dried yeast]]\n| 250g [[Strong white bread flour|strong white bread flour]]\n| 1 teaspoon [[Salt|salt]]\n| [[Oil]] for greasing\n| 1.5 [[Litres|litres]] water (for the Varoma)\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Put the 150g water and the [[Yeast|yeast]] in the bowl 2 minutes / 37\u00ba / Speed 1.\n| Add the [[Flour|flour]] and [[Salt|salt]] and 2 minutes 30 seconds / [[Knead]].\n| Leave to rise in the bowl until almost doubled in size, then 10 seconds / [[Knead]].\n| Shape the [[Dough|dough]] into a ball and put it in an oiled [[Soup|soup]] bowl which will fit into the Varoma.\n| Cover with a [[Tea towel|tea towel]] and leave for about an hour until doubled.\n| Pour the 1.5 [[Litres|litres]] of water into the bowl and place the Varoma, containing the [[Soup|soup]] bowl and [[Dough|dough]] on top of the TM bowl.\n| Cover, and [[Steam|steam]] for 45 minutes / Temp. Varoma / Speed 1.\n| Allow to cool and cut into 1cm slices.\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nMakes a wonderful [[Bread|bread]] for [[Pa amb tom\u00e0quet]] ([[Pa amb oli]]).\n===Variations===\nThis can also be made in a conventional manner.  Make and [[Knead|knead]] the [[Dough|dough]] according to your usual manner and [[Steam|steam]] in a in a saucepan or [[Steamer|steamer]] on the [[Hob|hob]], until it has the appearance of a [[Suet|suet]] pudding.\n===Chef's notes===\nThis [[Bread|bread]] will seem to be uncooked, but that is how it is.  It is very good [[Toasted|toasted]] and will last for days.\n\nI [[Steamed|steamed]] mine in an enamel pudding basin, which is fine, but the top of the [[Dough|dough]] does touch the Varoma lid towards the end of the [[Steaming|steaming]] time, if using a TM31.  The Varoma basket in the TM5 is deeper, so should not touch the lid if using this version.\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Spanish recipes]]\n[[Category:Accompaniments]]\n[[Category:Bread and baking]]\n[[Category:Breakfast recipes]]\n[[Category:Thermomix recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegan recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes]]\n[[Category:Breadmaker recipes]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#dough #steam #bread #knead #soup #steaming #litres #steamer #driedyeast #toasted #yeast </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
