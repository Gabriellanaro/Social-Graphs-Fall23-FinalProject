It is much thicker and is invariably served as a [[tapa]].  \n\nAntequera is about 50 km inland from M\u00e1laga and \"Antequerana\" seems to be the generic name for this dish, but bars and restaurants in that part of Spain sometimes name it after their own particular town or village.  See below for ''La Porra Archidonesa'', a piece of free verse\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 250 g stale [[Bread|bread]], made into [[Breadcrumbs|breadcrumbs]]\n| 4 Cloves of [[Garlic|garlic]] \n| 125 ml [[Extra virgin olive oil|extra virgin olive oil]]\n| 1 teaspoon [[Smoked|smoked]] or unsmoked [[Paprika|paprika]]\n| 250 g ripe [[Tomatoes|tomatoes]], skinned - if these are unavailable, weigh the equivalent amount of tinned tomatoes\n| 4 teaspoons [[Wine|wine]] or [[Sherry vinegar|sherry vinegar]], or [[Lemon juice|lemon juice]]\n| [[Salt]] \n| 2 [[Hard boiled eggs|hard boiled eggs]]\n| 100 g serrano [[Ham|ham]] \n| 1 tin of [[Tuna|tuna]] in [[Oil|oil]] (optional)\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Soak the [[Breadcrumbs|breadcrumbs]] in water for a few minutes - but see the poem below!.  If you are using tinned [[Tomatoes|tomatoes]], the [[Juice|juice]] is excellent for soaking.\n| Squeeze the [[Breadcrumbs|breadcrumbs]] to extract as much liquid from them as you can and put them in a [[Blender|blender]] or [[Food processor|food processor]] with the [[Garlic|garlic]].  Pulse for a few seconds to ensure that the garlic is finely chopped.\n| Add the [[Oil|oil]], [[Paprika|paprika]], [[Tomatoes|tomatoes]] and [[Vinegar|vinegar]] or [[Lemon juice|lemon juice]].  Blend thoroughly until the mixture is smooth and thick.  Add [[Salt|salt]] to taste and chill briefly.\n| Meanwhile, chop the [[Ham|ham]] quite finely and drain and [[Mash|mash]] the [[Tuna|tuna]] (if using).  Chop the [[Eggs|eggs]] into smallish pieces.\n| Pour the porra mixture in small bowls and place the [[Ham|ham]], [[Tuna|tuna]] and [[Eggs|eggs]] on top of it in separate places.  Do not mix them in.\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe with pieces of crusty [[Bread|bread]] and small [[Breadsticks|breadsticks]].  Eat with a fork, not a spoon.\n\n===Variations===\nThere are many, many variations of porra, eg. sometimes a skinned [[Roasted|roasted]] [[Pepper|pepper]] is added or the [[Paprika|paprika]] left out.   However, you must ensure that the proportion of [[Bread|bread]], [[Tomatoes|tomatoes]] and [[Oil|oil]] are the same as above and that you do include some [[Garlic|garlic]], even if it is only one [[Clove|clove]].  To make Porra archidonesa, omit the [[paprika]] and add a skinned [[Roasted|roasted]] green [[Pepper|pepper]].\n\n[[Eggs]] and [[Ham|ham]] are always added as a garnish.\n\n===Chef's tip===\nFor extra richness, a dash or two of [[Olive oil|olive oil]] can be added to the surface.\n\nSerrano [[Ham|ham]] is available in most supermarkets, including \"budget\" supermarkets such as Lidl's.  If you are unable to get it, substitute with another sort of dry-cured ham.  Do not use ordinary [[Boiled|boiled]] ham.\n\nWhilst porra is officially a tapa, it would also make an excellent first course.  Do not serve too much though as it is rather filling.\n\n== A poem:  La Porra Archidonesa ==\nby Miguel Salcedo Hierro translated from '''Gazpachos, Sopas y Ajos Blancos''' by Enrique Mapelli L\u00f3pez, Editorial Arguval (M\u00e1laga) ISBN 8495948702\n\nIn a round \u2018dornillo\u2019 <sup>[[#Foot1|1]]</sup>\n\none throws salt and one or two garlics<sup>[[#Foot2|2]]</sup>\n\na large green pepper\n\nand three peeled tomatoes.\n\nAll of this you begin to crush\n\ntogether with smashed pieces of bread;\n\nwithout soaking the latter\n\n-for that is for bad porras-.\n\nto it one adds little by little\n\nlight olive oil\n\nand a large dash of vinegar,\n\nthat is to give it a sharp edge.\n\nOne beats, beats, how one beats ...\n\nAnd we give ourselves a rest\n\nwhen all is merged\n\nwhen all is thickened.\n\nTo the porra of Archidona\n\nwe will go, spoon in hand!\n\n=====''Footnotes''=====\n* <span id=\"Foot1\"><sup>1</sup> A dornillo is a type of wooden bowl\n* <span id=\"Foot2\"><sup>2</sup> I think this means 2 cloves rather than 2 bulbs of garlic\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes|Porra]]\n[[Category:Egg recipes|Porra]]\n[[Category:Garlic recipes]]\n[[Category:Pork recipes|Porra]]\n[[Category:Spanish recipes|Porra]]\n[[Category:Starters|Porra]]\n[[Category:Snacks and light bites|Porra]]\n[[Category:Tapas, mezze and antipasti]]\n[[Category:Vegetable recipes|Porra]]\n[[Category:Uncooked]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#ham #tomatoes #paprika #bread #garlic #tuna #eggs #breadcrumbs #porraantequerana #lemonjuice #roasted </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
