This recipe has been reproduced here in English by kind permission of '''[http://larecetadelafelicidad.blogspot.com/2008/12/sopa-de-ajo-prisionera.html SandeeA]'''.  \nIt is a [[Garlic Soup|garlic soup]] covered with [[Puff pastry|puff pastry]] and is absolutely delicious!\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 3 tablespoons [[Oil|oil]]\n| 4 Cloves [[Garlic|garlic]], peeled and sliced\n| 7 slices of stale [[Bread|bread]], although fresh can be used\n| 1 level tablespoon [[Paprika|paprika]] \n| 1 litre [[Chicken stock|chicken stock]] (made from an [[Onion|onion]], a [[Carrot|carrot]], and a [[Chicken|chicken]] carcass)\n| 100 g small cubes of [[Ham|ham]] (shoulder of [[Jam\u00f3n ib\u00e9rico|Iberian ham]], preferably)\n| [[Salt]] to taste\n| 2 [[free range eggs]]\n| A little beaten [[Egg|egg]]\n| 500g [[Puff pastry|puff pastry]]\n}}\n\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n* Preheat the oven to 200 C/400 F/Gas 6\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Baked.jpg|Baked\nImage:Addition of beaten egg.jpg|Addition of beaten egg\nImage:Cooked in the stock.jpg|Cooked in the stock\nImage:The paprika and bread have been added.jpg|The paprika and bread have been added\nImage:Frying the garlic.jpg|Frying the garlic\n</gallery>\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Heat the [[Oil|oil]] in a pan, add the [[Garlic|garlic]] and allow it to turn golden. \n| Add the [[Ham|ham]] cubes and saut\u00e9 them with the [[Garlic|garlic]].\n| Add the slices of [[Bread|bread]] to allow them to colour a little. \n| Add the [[Paprika|paprika]], and immediately afterwards the [[Chicken stock|chicken stock]], so that the [[paprika]] does not become bitter. \n| Allow the [[Soup|soup]] to [[Simmer|simmer]] over a gentle heat for half-an-hour.\n| Check for seasoning and add [[Salt|salt]] if necessary.\n| Take some heat-resistant earthenware [[Soup|soup]] bowls and pour the soup into them.\n| Break an [[Egg|egg]] into each bowl.\n| [[Brush]] the rims and the outside tops of the bowls with a little beaten [[Egg|egg]].\n| Cut circles of [[Puff pastry|puff pastry]], about a centimetre or so larger than the top of the bowls, seal around the rim and [[Brush|brush]] with beaten [[Egg|egg]].\n| You can decorate the pastry if you wish.\n| Put the bowls into the oven for 10-15 minutes until the pastry is golden and has formed a dome over the [[Soup|soup]].\n| By this time, the [[Eggs|eggs]] should be firm, but with a runny yolk.\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nThe most delicious way to eat this is to break the pastry into the [[Soup|soup]] or cut small pieces away as you eat the soup.  If you do not like pastry, just cut the whole thing off, but you will lose the best of the dish. \n \nAnd enjoy it ... who said that a [[Garlic Soup|garlic soup]] dish cannot be a luxury?\n===Variations===\nIf you are a vegetarian, leave out the [[Ham|ham]] and use [[Vegetable stock|vegetable stock]] or [[Garlic|garlic]] [[Broth|broth]] instead of [[Chicken stock|chicken stock]].\n\nI adapted the recipe slightly by using 4 whole bulbs of [[Garlic|garlic]], no [[ham]], beaten [[egg]] instead of a whole one and using [[Paprika|Piment\u00f3n de la Vera]] which accounts for the brightness of the colour.  And before anyone asks, yes, I did eat the whole lot myself!\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes|Garlic soup imprisoned]]\n[[Category:Egg recipes|Garlic soup imprisoned]]\n[[Category:Garlic recipes|Garlic soup imprisoned]]\n[[Category:Soup and stock recipes|Garlic soup imprisoned]]\n[[Category:Spanish recipes|Garlic soup imprisoned]]\n[[Category:Starters|Garlic soup imprisoned]]\n[[Category:Boiled or simmered]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#egg #garlic #ham #soup #chickenstock #paprika #puffpastry #garlicsoup #brush #bread #broth </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
