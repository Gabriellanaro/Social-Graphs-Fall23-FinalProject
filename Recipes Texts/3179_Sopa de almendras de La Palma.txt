It also has the world's largest volcanic crater. \n\nTheir main production crop is [[Almonds|almonds]].\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 250 ml [[Olive oil|olive oil]]\n| 250 g unpeeled whole [[Almonds|almonds]]\n| 1 kg firm [[Potatoes|potatoes]], peeled and cut into small cubes\n| 3-4 Cloves [[Garlic|garlic]], finely chopped\n| 1 medium [[Onion|onion]], finely chopped \n| 2 largish [[Tomatoes|tomatoes]], peeled and finely chopped\n| 1 [[Bay leaf|bay leaf]]\n| A couple of sprigs of [[Thyme|thyme]]\n| [[Black pepper]]\n| [[Salt]]\n| A few strands of [[Saffron|saffron]]\n| 1 [[Clove|clove]]\n| Water or [[Vegetable stock|vegetable stock]]\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Grind up the unpeeled [[Almonds|almonds]] in a food processor.\n| Heat the [[Oil|oil]] in a saucepan, [[Fry|fry]] the [[Onion|onion]] and add the [[Garlic|garlic]] for a minute or two.\n| Add the [[Tomatoes|tomatoes]], [[Bay leaf|bay leaf]], [[Thyme|thyme]], [[Pepper|pepper]], [[Salt|salt]], [[Saffron|saffron]] and [[Clove|clove]].\n| Mix well and cook gently for a few minutes.\n| Add the [[Potatoes|potatoes]] and stir, followed by the [[Ground almonds|ground almonds]].\n| It is ready when the [[Potatoes|potatoes]] are cooked, but if you find that you need to, top it up with water or [[Vegetable stock|vegetable stock]] to prevent it sticking and then adjust seasoning accordingly.\n| Remove the [[Bay leaf|bay leaf]], [[Thyme|thyme]] and [[Clove|clove]] before serving.\n}}\n===Chef's notes===\nAs it is intended to be a thick [[Soup|soup]], it is essential to watch it and stir it.  Do not use too much water - just enough to allow the [[Potatoes|potatoes]] to cook.\n\nTo save time, you could [[Par boil|par boil]] the cubed [[Potato|potato]] before adding it to the [[Soup|soup]].  However, start with potataoes in cold water, so that the cubes are less likely to break up as it is desirable to retain the whole cubes in the finished product.--[[User:JuliaBalbilla|JuliaBalbilla]] 09:54, 6 January 2009 (UTC)\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes|Almond soup]]\n[[Category:Potato recipes|Almond soup]]\n[[Category:Soup and stock recipes|Almond soup]]\n[[Category:Spanish recipes|Almond soup]]\n[[Category:Vegan recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegetable recipes|Almond soup]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes|Almond soup]]\n[[Category:Boiled or simmered]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#potatoes #bayleaf #thyme #almonds #garlic #soup #vegetablestock #tomatoes #sopadealmendrasdelapalma #saffron #onion </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
