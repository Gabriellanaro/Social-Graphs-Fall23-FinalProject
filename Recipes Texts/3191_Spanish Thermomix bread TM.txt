This is due to the recipe having only 58% hydration, ie not enough water, so next time, I will try it with 400g water.  Spanish [[butter]] is usually unsalted, so if you use salted [[butter]], I would reduce the [[salt]] quantity in the [[dough]].  However, in general the '''bread''' was good, crusty on the outside, with a nice, soft, but twisted looking crumb.\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Spanish recipes]]\n[[Category:Bread and baking]]\n[[Category:Vegan recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes]]\n[[Category:Thermomix recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#dough #butter #yeast #bread #browning #strongflour #thermomix #thermomixrecipes #spanish #bake #flour </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
