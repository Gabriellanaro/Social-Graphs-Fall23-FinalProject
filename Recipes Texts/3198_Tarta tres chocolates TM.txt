Take it to the [[Fridge|fridge]] again to set.\n}}\n====For the 3rd layer:====\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Makes more ridges over the 2nd layer, wash the bowl well so that the colours do not mix.\n| Break the white [[Chocolate|chocolate]] into pieces and place in the bowl with the [[Sugar|sugar]], [[Milk|milk]], [[Cream|cream]] and [[Royal cuajada|cuajada]] '''7 minutes / 90 degrees / Speed 5'''.\n| Tip into the tin and [[Refrigerate|refrigerate]] for several hours.\n| Once chilled un-mould it from the tin.\n| It can be [[Frozen|frozen]] whole, but do not cut beforehand or it may become gooey.\n}}\n===Recipe source===\n\n* Recipe reproduced here with permission of La Juani de Ana Sevilla under Creative Commons (Save Creative) licence [http://www.juanideanasevilla.com/2011/07/tarta-tres-chocolates.html Tarta tres chocolates]\n===Chef's notes===\nThe original recipe is made in a [[Heart|heart]]-shaped tin, but if you don\u0092t have one, I would suggest using an 8 or 9 inch (20 or 23 cms) round tin or a 7 or 8 inch (18 or 20cm) square one. It just depends on how tall you want it. I used a 7 inch (18cm) round one which was too small so had to bin some of the mixture. Line with [[Bake-O-Glide]] if you like, then no need to grease.\n\nThe [[Chocolate|chocolate]] I used was that with the highest percentage of [[Cocoa|cocoa]] solids I could get.\n\nThe [[Royal cuajada|cuajada]] can be obtained from [[R Garcia & Sons]] in London.\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Spanish recipes]]\n[[Category:Sweets and desserts]]\n[[Category:Thermomix recipes]]\n[[Category:Boiled or simmered]]\n[[Category:Favourite recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#chocolate #royalcuajada #cream #doublecream #fridge #biscuit #butter #favouriterecipes #spatula #frozen #refrigerate </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
