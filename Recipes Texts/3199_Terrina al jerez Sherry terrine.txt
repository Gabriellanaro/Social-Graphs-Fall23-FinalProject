Unlike like the [[Terrines|terrines]] I have made before, this one uses [[Lard|lard]], rather than solid [[Pork|pork]] [[Fat|fat]]\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| [[Oil]]\n| 400 g boneless, skinless [[Chicken|chicken]] breasts or thighs\n| 500 g [[Veal|veal]], [[Minced|minced]]\n| 100 g [[Lard|lard]], softened, plus some extra\n| 2 tablespoons [[breadcrumbs]]\n| 3 bulbs [[Garlic, crushed|garlic, crushed]]\n| 2 [[Eggs|eggs]], beaten\n| 120 ml [[Dry sherry|dry sherry]]\n| Seasoning\n| 150 g [[Serrano ham]], in one piece then cut into small strips\n\n}}\n\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n* Preheat the [[Oven|oven]] to 180C/gas 4.\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Heat some [[Oil|oil]] in a non-stick [[Frying pan|frying pan]] and [[Brown|brown]] the [[Chicken|chicken]] breasts on each side for 2 minutes.\n| Transfer to a small [[Roasting|roasting]] tin and [[Roast|roast]] for 12 minutes, or until cooked.\n| Remove from tin and allow to cool.\n| Meanwhile, mix together the remaining ingredients, except of the [[Serrano ham]].\n| When the [[Chicken|chicken]] has cooled, chop it roughly and add to the [[Veal|veal]] mixture.\n| Reduce the [[Oven|oven]] temperature to 160\u00b0 C (325\u00b0 F - gas 3).\n| Line a 1 kg [[Bread|bread]] pan or [[Terrine|terrine]] with [[Foil|foil]] and grease the foil with the extra [[Lard|lard]].\n| Starting with the [[Veal|veal]] and [[Chicken|chicken]] mixture, fill the [[Terrine|terrine]] by layering alternately with the [[Serrano ham]], ending with the veal.\n|  Cover the top of the [[Terrine|terrine]] with double-thickness of [[Tin foil|tin foil]], making a lengthways pleat to allow the [[Steam|steam]] to rise.\n|  Place the tin into a large [[Roasting|roasting]] tin and fill it with hot water so that it comes half-way up the side of the [[Bread|bread]] tin. Add further water as and when it is necessary\n| Cook for about two and a quarter hours, allowing an extra 15 minutes if the mixture has been [[Refrigerated|refrigerated]]. The [[Terrine|terrine]] is cooked when it has contracted from the sides of the tin and the [[Juice|juice]] runs yellow, when tested with a skewer.\n| Remove from [[Oven|oven]] and whilst it is still hot, place several cans, eg [[Tomatoes|tomatoes]], horizontally and evenly on top of the [[Foil|foil]], to press the [[Terrine|terrine]]. Leave until completely cold.\n| Chill for several hours or overnight, still weighted down.\n| Remove the weights and [[Foil|foil]] and turn out onto clean foil.\n| Wrap the [[Foil|foil]] around it and leave the p\u00e2t\u00e9 until it has been cold for at least 24 hours before cutting.\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe with nice [[Bread|bread]], [[Salad|salad]] and a good strong [[Cheese|cheese]]. \n===Variations===\nExperiment with various types of [[Meat|meat]] such as [[Pork|pork]], [[Game|game]] and [[Salami|salami]] and try [[Wine|wine]], [[Calvados]] or [[Cider|cider]] instead of [[Sherry|sherry]].\n===Chef's notes===\nThis [[Terrine|terrine]] is very delicate, so be careful when slicing it.\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Garlic recipes]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:Poultry recipes]]\n[[Category:Snacks and light bites]]\n[[Category:Spanish recipes]]\n[[Category:Starters]]\n[[Category:Veal recipes]]\n[[Category:Cooking with wine]]\n[[Category:Pan fried]]\n[[Category:Steamed]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#terrine #chicken #veal #foil #bread #lard #serranoham #roasting #pork #salami #salad </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
