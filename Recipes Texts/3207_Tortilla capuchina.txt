Never having eaten tinned asparagus, I neither recommend nor decry it.  However I have eaten the white [[Asparagus#Esp\u00e1rrago de Navarra|Esp\u00e1rrago de Navarra]] which is available throughout the year in jars.  It tends to be much thicker than English asparagus so may need to be sliced, rather than cut into lengths.  It has an excellent flavour, although any resulting tortilla would not be as colourful as those made with the green variety.\n\n{{Tortillas-See also}}\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Breakfast recipes]]\n[[Category:Egg recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Potato recipes]]\n[[Category:Snacks and light bites]]\n[[Category:Spanish recipes]]\n[[Category:Tapas, mezze and antipasti]]\n[[Category:Vegetable recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes]]\n[[Category:Pan fried]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#tortilla #asparagus #tortillacapuchina #potatoes #onion #tapa #breadcrumbs #eggs #parsley #garlic #potato </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
