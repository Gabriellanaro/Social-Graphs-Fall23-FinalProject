[[Ham]] and [[Tomato|tomato]] are also used as toppings.  If your tostas are smallish, then you can make various [[Tapas|tapas]] by, for example, taking a slice of [[Tortilla|tortilla]] and an [[Olive|olive]], and skewering them to a tosta with a [[cocktail stick]].\n===Variations===\nYou can use [[Garlic|garlic]]-infused [[Olive oil|olive oil]] if you wish.\n===Chef's notes===\nThe length and width of your loaf will determine the number and size of the slices.  The [[Bread|bread]] in the image above was a normal [[French loaf]] - for bigger slices, you will need something rather wider.  Tostas will keep in an airtight container such as a [[Lock&Lock boxes|Lock&Lock bowl]].  I tried making these with ciabatta, but the resulting tostas turned our so hard that I almost broke my teeth on them, so stick to something with a similar texture to a [[French loaf]].\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes|Tostas]]\n[[Category:Accompaniments|Tostas]]\n[[Category:Breakfast recipes|Tostas]]\n[[Category:Snacks and light bites|Tostas]]\n[[Category:Spanish recipes|Tostas]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes|Tostas]]\n[[Category:Vegan recipes]]\n[[Category:Grilled, griddled or barbecued]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#tostas #bread #oliveoil #bake #garlic #frenchloaf #tortilla #grilled #olive #brush #tomato </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
