In [[Spain]] many family members and friends come together to eat [[Paella]] at home, on the beach, in restaurants and at Fiesta time as anytime is a good time to eat Paella. Here are some Paella recipes to [[Help|help]] you on your Paella journey. Happy eats,  buena comida, buenos amigos (Good food, good friends) gracias.\"\n\n''Dominic Green'': [[Paella World]]\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| 4 [[Chicken thighs]] or 3 chopped [[Chicken breasts|chicken breasts]]\n| 225g [[Chorizo]] sausage ring (sliced)\n| 400g [[Rabbit]] (Optional)\n| 1 medium [[Onion]] (Chopped)\n| Half [[Red pepper|red pepper]] (Chopped)\n| 200g chopped [[Tomatoes|tomatoes]]\n| 2 [[Cloves of garlic|cloves of garlic]] (crushed and chopped)\n| 4 strands of [[Saffron]] (if available)\n| Half  teaspoon of [[Paella]] Colourant\n| Half teaspoon of [[Paprika]] Dulce\n| 300g [[Bomba]] [[Rice]]\n| 100g [[Frozen]] [[Garden peas|garden peas]]\n| Small tin of [[Black olives|black olives]]\n| 250ml of [[Chicken stock|chicken stock]]\n| 75 ml [[White wine|white wine]] (optional)\n| Water (if required)\n| 2 [[Bay leaves]]\n| [[Salt]] and [[Pepper|pepper]] to taste\n| Chopped Fresh [[Parsley]]\n| [[Lemon wedges]] to garnish\n}}\n\n\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| In your [[Paella]] pan (38cm to 42cm recommended) pour in around 2 tablespoons of [[Extra virgin olive oil|extra virgin olive oil]] and set heat to medium to high.\n| Add [[Chicken|chicken]] and [[Rabbit|rabbit]] (optional) and cook until [[Browned|browned]].\n| Add the sliced [[Chorizo|chorizo]] ring, [[Onions|onions]], [[Garlic|garlic]], [[Red pepper|red pepper]] and cook for 3 minutes until [[Onions|onions]] are starting to soften.\n| Add the [[Bay leaves|bay leaves]], half tin of [[Tomatoes|tomatoes]], [[Wine|wine]], [[Chicken stock|chicken stock]] and bring to the [[Boil|boil]]. Then add [[Paprika]] Dulce, [[Paella]] Colourant, [[Saffron]] (Grind up the strands with a [[Pestle and mortar|pestle and mortar]] to start the flavour flowing), [[Garden peas|garden peas]] and stir round (the smell from this should be amazing!).\n| Sprinkle the [[Bomba]] [[Rice]] evenly around the pan, stir in and bring back up to [[Boil|boil]] and turn down the heat to [[Simmer|simmer]] (add water if [[Rice|rice]] soaks up the liquid quickly).\n| Cook for a further 20 minutes or until the [[Bomba]] [[Rice]] is soft to bite. Keep stirring throughout so the [[Rice|rice]] does not stick to the bottom of the pan (Although in [[Spain]] Traditional [[Paella]] is cooked to stick to the bottom of the pan so the choice is yours?).\n| Add the [[Black olives|black olives]], remove the [[Bay leaves|bay leaves]] and stir in the fresh chopped [[Parsley|parsley]].\n| Season to taste with [[Salt|salt]] and [[Black pepper|black pepper]]. Take off the heat and cover for 5 minutes to let all the ingredients truly infuse together.\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe with [[Lemon wedges|lemon wedges]] and tuck in for a fantastic treat for you and your guests!!\n===Recipe source===\n* ''Dominic Green'' from [http://www.paellaworld.co.uk Paella World]: [[Paella World]] has kindly given Cookipedia permission to use this recipe.
