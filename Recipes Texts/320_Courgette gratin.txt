I managed nearly a pint of drained liquid from 1 kg of [[courgettes]]!\n* Preheat the [[Oven|oven]] to 180\u00b0 C (350\u00b0 F - gas 4), [fan [[Oven|oven]] 160\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]\n\n\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| Heat 1 tablespoon of [[Olive oil|olive oil]] in a [[Wok|wok]] or [[Frying pan|frying pan]]\n| Add a good grind of [[Black pepper|black pepper]] and then saut\u00e9 the onions for 5 minutes until softened, don't [[Brown|brown]] them. Stir in the [[Crushed garlic|crushed garlic]] of the last minute just to cook the roughness from it\n| Reserve the [[Onions|onions]] and [[Garlic|garlic]] to a large mixing bowl and add 2 tablespoons of [[Olive oil|olive oil]] and when nice and hot, saut\u00e9 the [[Courgettes|courgettes]] until softened, about 12 minutes\n| Add all of the [[Eggs|eggs]] to a the mixing bowl holding the [[Onions|onions]] and [[Garlic|garlic]] and beat with a fork\n| Mix in the cooked [[Rice|rice]] into the [[Courgettes|courgettes]] to absorb the [[Oil|oil]], and add to the [[Egg|egg]] mixture together with 50 g of the [[Grated|grated]] [[Cheese|cheese]], [[Onions|onions]] and [[Garlic|garlic]]\n| If the courgettes are very hot, leave them for 15 minutes to cook or you might end up with un-pourable [[scrambled eggs]] when you mix them in.\n| Season with a little [[Black pepper|black pepper]]\n| Pour the mixture into a shallow gratin dish and sprinkle with the remaining [[Grated|grated]] [[Cheese|cheese]] and drizzle the last tablespoon of [[Olive oil|olive oil]] over the top\n| [[Bake]] in the middle of the [[Oven|oven]] for 30 minutes\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nAllow to cool a little so it can be served warm and serve, sprinkled with freshly chopped [[Parsley|parsley]].\n===Chef's notes===\nEven after rinsing the courgettes well, there is still a tiny hint of salt in this dish so you won't want to add any extra salt as seasoning.\n\nYou can also use a mixture of, [[Grated|grated]]: ( eg: [[Parmesan cheese]], [[Jarlsberg cheese]], mature [[Cheddar cheese]], [[Gruy\u00e8re cheese]])\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Snacks and light bites]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes]]\n[[Category:Cheese recipes]]\n[[Category:Egg recipes]]\n[[Category:Garlic recipes]]\n[[Category:Salad recipes]]\n[[Category:Pies tarts and flans]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#courgettes #onions #oliveoil #courgettegratin #garlic #cheese #grated #parsley #blackpepper #jarlsbergcheese #scrambledeggs </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
