In [[Spain]] many family members and friends come together to eat [[Paella]] at home, on the beach, in restaurants and at Fiesta time as anytime is a good time to eat Paella. Here are some Paella recipes to [[Help|help]] you on your Paella journey. Happy eats,  buena comida, buenos amigos (Good food, good friends) gracias.\"\n\n''Dominic Green'': [[Paella World]]\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| 200g [[Prawns]] (400g if using unpeeled)\n| 200g [[Mussels]]\n| 100g [[Squid]] rings\n| 200g [[Clams]]\n| 1 medium [[Onion]] (Chopped)\n| Half [[Red pepper|red pepper]] (Chopped)\n| 200g chopped [[Tomatoes|tomatoes]]\n| 2 [[Cloves of garlic|cloves of garlic]]\n| 4 strands of [[Saffron]] (if available)\n| Half  teaspoon of [[Paella]] Colourant\n| Half teaspoon of [[Paprika]] Dulce\n| 300g [[Bomba]] [[Rice]]\n| 100g [[Frozen]] [[Garden peas|garden peas]]\n| Small tin of [[Black olives|black olives]]\n| 250ml of [[Vegetable|vegetable]] or [[Chicken stock|chicken stock]]\n| 125ml [[Glass|glass]] of [[White wine|white wine]] (optional)\n| Water (if required)\n| 2 [[Bay leaves]]\n| [[Salt]] and [[Pepper|pepper]] to taste\n| Chopped Fresh [[Parsley]]\n| [[Lemon wedges]] to garnish\n}}\n\n\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| Chop the [[Garlic|garlic]], [[Onion]], [[Pepper|pepper]] and [[Vegetables|vegetables]]\n| In your [[Paella]] pan (38cm to 42cm recommended) pour in around 2 tablespoons of [[Extra virgin olive oil|extra virgin olive oil]] and set heat to medium to high. Add [[Onions|onions]], [[Garlic|garlic]], [[Red pepper|red pepper]] and cook for 3 minutes until [[Onions|onions]] are starting to soften.\n| Add the [[Bay leaves|bay leaves]], half tin of [[Tomatoes|tomatoes]], [[Wine|wine]], [[Vegetable Stock|vegetable stock]] and bring to the [[Boil|boil]]. \n| Then add [[Paprika]] Dulce, [[Paella]] Colourant, [[Saffron]] (Grind up the strands with a [[Pestle and mortar|pestle and mortar]] to start the flavour flowing), [[Garden peas|garden peas]] and stir round (the smell from this should be amazing!).\n|  Sprinkle the [[Bomba]] [[Rice]] evenly around the pan, stir in and bring back up to [[Boiling|boiling]] and turn down the heat to [[Simmer|simmer]] (add water if [[Rice|rice]] soaks up the liquid quickly).\n| Cook for a further 20 minutes or until the [[Rice|rice]] is soft to bite. Keep stirring throughout so the [[Bomba]] [[Rice]] does not stick to the bottom of the pan (Although in [[Spain]] Traditional [[Paella]] is cooked to stick to the bottom of the pan so the choice is yours?).\n| You can add the [[Seafood|seafood]] to the pan at this point and cook for a further 5 minutes but I prefer to cook the [[Seafood|seafood]] in a separate pan in [[White wine|white wine]] until all the [[Mussels|mussels]] and [[Clams|clams]] have opened (but discard any ones that do not open) then add this to the [[Bomba]] [[Rice]] and stir in with the [[Black olives|black olives]], remove the [[Bay leaves|bay leaves]] and stir in the fresh chopped [[Parsley|parsley]].\n| Season to taste with [[Salt|salt]] and [[Black pepper|black pepper]]. Take off the heat and cover for 5 minutes to let all the ingredients truly infuse together.   Serve with [[Lemon wedges|lemon wedges]] and tuck in for a fantastic treat for you and your guests!!\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe with [[Lemon wedges|lemon wedges]] and tuck in for a fantastic treat for you and your guests!!\n===Recipe source===\n\n* ''Dominic Green'' from [http://www.paellaworld.co.uk Paella World]: [[Paella World]] has kindly given Cookipedia permission to use this recipe.  [[Paella World]] can supply any specialist paella ingredients.\n===Chef's notes===\nHad any [[Seafood|seafood]] you like\u0085 [[Scallops|scallops]], [[Crab|crab]], [[Octopus]], [[Langoustines]] or even [[Lobster|lobster]] as an example and take out the [[Seafood|seafood]] you don\u0092t like.\n\nAdd half teaspoon of hot [[Paprika|paprika]] if you like a bit of heat in your food. It also enhances the favours in the dish.\n\nI usually buy 6 to 8 big [[Prawns|prawns]] or [[Langoustines|langoustines]] to lay on top of the finished dish for excellent presentation which is guaranteed to impress your guests!\n\nDouble the amounts above if cooking for 8 and so on.\n===Paella recipes===\n* '''[[Paella alicantina]]'''\n* '''[[Vegetarian paella]]'''\n* '''Another [[Vegetarian paella (2)|Vegetarian paella]]\n* '''[[Traditional seafood paella]]'''\n* '''[[Traditional meat paella]]'''\n[[Category:Ingredients]]\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Spanish recipes]]\n[[Category:Historic recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Tapas, mezze and antipasti]]\n[[Category:Fish recipes]]\n[[Category:Freshwater fish recipes]]\n[[Category:Rice recipes]]\n[[Category:Sea fish recipes]]\n[[Category:Shellfish recipes]]\n[[Category:Cooking with wine]]\n[[Category:Boiled or simmered]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#paella #rice #seafood #bomba #bayleaves #lemonwedges #paellaworld #paprika #onion #onions #langoustines </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
