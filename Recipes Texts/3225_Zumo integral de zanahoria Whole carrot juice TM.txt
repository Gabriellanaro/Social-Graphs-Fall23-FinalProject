It uses the whole [[Carrots|carrots]] whereas if made in a [[Juicer|juicer]] the pulp will be wasted.\n\nThis is a translation of a recipe in '''Thermomix TM31 Imprescindible para tu cocina''', which is the book you receive when buying a [[Thermomix]] in [[Spain]].\n\n{{RecipeIngredientsTM\n| 350g [[Carrots|carrots]], peeled\n| 1 [[Lemon|lemon]], peeled, pith and [[Seeds|seeds]] removed\n| 100g [[Sugar|sugar]] (see Chef's notes below)\n| 500g water (approx)\n| 6 or 8 ice cubes\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Chop the [[Carrots|carrots]] '''5 seconds / Speed 5'''.\n| Add the [[Lemon|lemon]], [[Sugar|sugar]], water and ice cubes and set for '''3 minutes / Speed 10'''.\n| If it is not smooth enough for you, repeat the operation for a little longer.\n| Add the basket to the bowl to strain it, hold it down with the spatula and pour into a jug filled with ice.\n| If it is well blended, there is no need to strain it.\n}}\n===Chef's notes===\nThe [[Sugar|sugar]] content is high and can be cut down.  I found the [[Juice|juice]] to be very sweet and feel that 60g is sufficient.  However, I did not pour mine over a jug of ice, which would have made it less sweet.\n\nYou might need ear plugs when processing at '''Speed 10'''!\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Spanish recipes]]\n[[Category:Drink and beverage recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegan recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes]]\n[[Category:Fruit recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegetable recipes]]\n[[Category:Thermomix recipes]]\n\n[[Category:Uncooked]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#carrots #juice #thermomix #lemon #juicer #seeds #carrot #spain </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
