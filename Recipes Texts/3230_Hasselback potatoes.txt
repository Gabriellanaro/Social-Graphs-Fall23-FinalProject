Thanks to '''[http://www.seasaltwithfood.com/ Seasaltwithfood]''' for the recipe, which is reproduced here under '''[http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/ Creative Commons]'''.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 6 Medium Size [[Potatoes]]\n| 2 - 3 Cloves [[Garlic|garlic]], thinly sliced\n| 2 tablespoons [[Olive oil|olive oil]]\n| 30 g [[Butter]]\n| Maldon [[Sea Salt]]\n| [[Freshly ground black pepper|Freshly ground black pepper]]\n\n}}\n\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n* Preheat the [[Oven|oven]] to 220\u00b0C (425\u00b0F).\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Put the [[Potato|potato]] on a chopping board, flat side down. \n| Start from one end of the [[Potato|potato]], cut almost all the way through, at about 3 to 4 mm intervals.\n| Arrange the [[Potatoes|potatoes]] in a [[Baking tray|baking tray]] and insert the [[Garlic|garlic]] in between the slits. \n| Scatter some [[Butter|butter]] on top of each [[Potato|potato]]. \n| Then drizzle the [[Olive oil|olive oil]] and sprinkle some [[Sea Salt|sea salt]] and [[Freshly ground black pepper|freshly ground black pepper]].\n| [[Bake]] the [[Potatoes|potatoes]] for about 40 minutes or until the potatoes turn crispy and the flesh is soft.\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe with [[Salad|salad]] and [[Grated|grated]] [[Cheese|cheese]].\n===Variations===\nTraditionally, [[Garlic|garlic]] is not used and the [[Potatoes|potatoes]] are sprinkled with [[breadcrumbs]].\n===Chef's notes===\nSuggested [[Potato|potato]] types: Cara, Estima, Marfona, Maris Piper, Mozart, Vivaldi.  I was inclined to use a little more [[oil]] and [[butter]], melting it first in the pan on the hob.  I then add the [[potatoes]] and [[brush]]ed the [[fat]] over the top of them, then put into the oven.  --[[User:JuliaBalbilla|JuliaBalbilla]] 15:33, 20 November 2010 (GMT)\n\nDare I say that I think these can be made even better by following the salting and dehydrating process as used in this [[Baked potatoes]] recipe.  It sounds complex, it's not. It takes a few minutes of preparation and needs to be done a few hours before you cook them but results in a very crunchy outer skin, similar to ''handmade'' crisps but with the flesh as normal. --[[User:Chef|Chef]] 09:44, 27 December 2010 (GMT) \n\nAbsolutely!  Oddly enough, I did think of doing that when I made them, but I was too hungry to wait.  I will try that today.  --[[User:JuliaBalbilla|JuliaBalbilla]] 09:58, 27 December 2010 (GMT)\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Swedish recipes]]\n[[Category:Accompaniments]]\n[[Category:Snacks and light bites]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes]]\n[[Category:Potato recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegetable recipes]]\n[[Category:Favourite recipes]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#potatoes #potato #garlic #butter #hasselbackpotatoes #oliveoil #bakingtray #cheese #grated #brush #fat </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
