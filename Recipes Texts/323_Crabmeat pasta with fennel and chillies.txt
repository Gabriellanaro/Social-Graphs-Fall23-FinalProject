I've dressed it with fresh [[Parsley|parsley]] and [[Grilled|grilled]] [[Sweetcorn|sweetcorn]] as I can't wait for another chance to play with my Rothenberger MAPP blowtorch!\n\nI've used 2 packets of premium claw [[Crabmeat|crabmeat]] from Morrisons, about \u00a33.75 per carton ''Dec 2014''.\n\nThis was one of the nicest [[pasta]] dishes that I've ever made.  I'm sure it would be even better made with fresh [[crab]].  The [[sweet corn]] was absolutely essential for the balance of this dish, it's sweetness of setting the lemony tang.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| 1 portion of [[Home made pasta|home made pasta]], cut into rustic strips, or 180 g [[Dried pasta|dried pasta]] of your choosing.\n| 2 x 114 g packs of Premium Claw [[Crabmeat]]\n| 1 fresh [[Lemons|lemons]]\n| Half a bulb of [[Fennel|fennel]]\n| 1 small [[Red chilli|red chilli]]\n| 1 [[Indian]] [[Green chilli|green chilli]]\n| 1 teaspoon of freshly chopped [[parsley]]\n| 4 tablespoons of [[Extra virgin Olive oil|extra virgin olive oil]]\n}}\n'''to garnish'''\n{{RecipeIngredientsNB\n| 1 fresh [[Sweet corn|sweet corn]] cob\n| Freshly chopped [[dill]]\n| A few nice [[Tomatoes|tomatoes]]\n}}\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n\n* If you're using [[Fresh pasta|fresh pasta]], don't forget that you are best leaving it in the [[Fridge|fridge]] for an hour or so before you roll it out.  For this recipe I'm assuming that you have your [[Pasta|pasta]] already sorted!\n\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| Add the [[Crabmeat|crabmeat]] to a bowl and add a pinch of [[Black pepper|black pepper]], a good pinch of chopped [[Parsley|parsley]] and any of the green [[Fennel tops|fennel tops]] if there are any.\n| Cut the base of the [[Fennel|fennel]] and trim any grotty bits.\n| Grate the [[Fennel bulb|fennel bulb]] into the [[Crab|crab]].  I've used my new [[Jamie Oliver acid etched coarse grater]].  If you have one, mind your fingers.  It does a blinding job but it is dreadfully sharp!\n| Using a small microplane [[Grater|grater]], add the [[Zest|zest]] of the [[Lemon|lemon]] to the [[Crab meat|crab meat]].\n| Deseed the both of the [[Chillies|chillies]] and chop finely. Add half to the [[Crab meat|crab meat]] and keep the remainder for dressing the dish.\n| Stir up the [[Olive oil|olive oil]] with the [[Juice|juice]] of the zested [[Lemon|lemon]] and mix this together with the chopped [[parsley]], into the [[Crab meat|crab meat]].\n| Gently heat the [[Crab meat|crab meat]] in a separate pan and cook your [[Pasta|pasta]] in a large pan of [[Boiling|boiling]] water. 3 minutes for [[Fresh pasta|fresh pasta]], 7 minutes + for [[Dried pasta|dried pasta]].\n| While the [[Pasta|pasta]] is cooking, [[Microwave|microwave]] the [[Sweet corn|sweet corn]] for a few minutes and toast it with your blowtorch if you have one. See here for more.\n| Drain the [[Pasta|pasta]], keeping back a ladle of the cooking [[Liquor|liquor]].\n| Mix the [[Pasta|pasta]] into the [[Crabmeat|crabmeat]], adding an eggcup full of the pasta water to thin the [[Sauce|sauce]] if needed.\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe, scattered with the blackened [[Sweetcorn|sweetcorn]], chopped [[dill]] and the chopped [[Chillies|chillies]].\n\n{{Template:YoutubePastaDough}}\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Italian recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Chilli pepper recipes]]\n[[Category:Fish recipes]]\n[[Category:Pasta recipes]]\n[[Category:Sea fish recipes]]\n[[Category:Shellfish recipes]]\n[[Category:Boiled or simmered]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#crabmeat #pasta #sweetcorn #parsley #crab #crabmeatpastawithfennelandchillies #driedpasta #lemon #fennel #dill #freshpasta </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
