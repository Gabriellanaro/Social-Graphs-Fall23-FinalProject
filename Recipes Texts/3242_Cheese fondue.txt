Chunks of crisp French baguettes, dipped in hot cheese with a bowl of [[pickles]]. Great for parties - especially Abigail's.  Time for and all of us to find the 70's fondue set that we all have somewhere, gathering dust under the stairs.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 1 white French baguette, cubed\n| 1 clove of [[Garlic|garlic]], peeled and crushed\n| 1 teaspoon of [[lemon juice]]\n| 350 ml Sauvignon Blanc - dry [[white wine]]\n| 300g [[grated]] [[Gruy\u00e8re cheese]] \n| 300g grated [[Emmental cheese]]\n| 1 teaspoon [[cornflour]]\n| 3 tablespoons [[Kirsch]]\n| [[Freshly ground black pepper]], [[grated]] [[nutmeg]], [[paprika]] to taste\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| On the stove, not the silly little burner they usually provide with the sets. This is only designed for keeping it warm and liquid '''after''' it has melted.\n| Add the [[wine]] and bring it to the boil\n| Turn down the heat and add both of the [[cheeses]] a little at a time, stirring, until it's has all melted and is properly combined.\n| Add the crushed garlic (I now concur with [[User:JuliaBalbilla]] on this, don't mess with rubbing it round the pan and then discarding it, chuck it all in!)\n| Mix the [[Kirsch]] and [[lemon juice]] into the [[cornflour]] and add to the cheese. Cook for 2-3 minutes, stirring, until it has thickened\n| Add the spices\n| Move the pot to the burner on the table\n| Spear the bread on to fondue forks and dip into the [[cheese]]\n| Crank up Donna Summer's \"Love to love you, baby\" and get your party started!\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\n* Serve with a bowl of dill [[pickles]] and pickled onions\n* Serve with crispy [[jacket potatoes]]\n===Variations===\n\nWe had no [[kirsch]] (and had no inclination to buy a bottle for just 3 tablespoons of it) so used dark [[rum]].  It was lovely!  [[Brandy]] would be just as good I would imagine.\n\n===Don't have a fondue set?===\n\nNo problem:\n# Use a heavy cast iron pan such as [[Le Creuset]], take to the table on a thick wooden or heatproof mat and nip out to the kitchen and reheat it if the cheese thickens too much.  You'll probably only need to do this once or twice during the meal.\n# Or just invite your friends into the kitchen and eat it over the stove\n\nThen you can decide if you want to go out and buy a dedicated fondue set.\n\n===Left overs===\n\nLeftover fondue scooped into a baguette and toasted with a [[Breville Stainless Steel Panini Press]] makes an excellent breakfast!\n\n==See also==\n* Our selection of other [[Fondue|fondue recipes]]\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Cheese recipes]]\n[[Category:Dips and sauces]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Swiss recipes]]\n[[Category:Cooking with wine]]\n[[Category:Boiled or simmered]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#kirsch #cheesefondue #pickles #lemonjuice #grated #cornflour #wine #paprika #nutmeg #boiledorsimmered #jacketpotatoes </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
