It's nice - a one-pot rice dish.  Simples!</span> \n\n<span class=\"reviewAuthor\"> [[User:PSmith|Paul&nbsp;R&nbsp;Smith]] </span></span>\n}}\nJambalaya always brings to mind the Carpenters song; ''Jambalaya (On the Bayou)''  Not a Carpenters song but a dish traditionally made in one pot, with [[Meats|meats]] and [[Vegetables|vegetables]]. It is completed by adding [[Stock|stock]] and [[Rice|rice]].  Looking at various recipes in more detail, this strikes me now as a typical leftover dish.  Cooking up what you have around at the time.\n===Making this your own recipe===\nWhen I made this for the first time, not having the slightest idea what jambalaya was, it looked quite complex, however, having made it many times now I now think it is probably one of the easiest recipes around. It is also a brilliant recipe to adapt to your own personal taste.  It is also an excellent recipe for using up leftovers.\n\nJust follow a few basic steps and you will be able to make you own version of this recipe.\n* Rinse the rice in cold running water first.\n* Fry the onions, garlic and vegetables first, plus any meat that might need more cooking than the rice does.\n* Ensure the rice is well coated in the oil before adding any stock.\n* Measure the stock by doubling the volume of the rice (4 cups of water to 2 cups of rice, etc.)\n* Don't add all of the stock at once, add more if it looks as though it will dry out before the rice is done.\n* If you have ingredients that don't need much cooking (prawns etc.) or vegetables that you want to serve with a bit of a crunch then add them during the last five minutes of cooking.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 1 x 2kg (4 lb) [[Chicken|chicken]], [[Parson's nose|parson's nose removed]]\n| A few [[Bay leaf|bay leaves]]\n| 1 [[Onion|onion]], unpeeled, chopped into quarters\n| About 200 g from one or more of cooked meat\n| 40 g (1 &frac12; oz) [[Butter|butter]], [[ghee]] or [[olive oil]]\n| 4 to 7 [[Cloves garlic, peeled and crushed|cloves garlic, peeled and crushed]]\n| 6 [[Spring onions|spring onions]], [[Chopped on the diagonal|chopped on the diagonal]]\n| 2 sticks of [[Celery|celery]], 'strings' removed with a [[Mandoline|mandoline]] and chopped into moons\n| 3 or 4 sweet [[Bell peppers|bell peppers]], any colour, deseeded and chopped\n| 3 teaspoons [[Paprika powder|paprika powder]]\n| &#189; teaspoon of [[dried oregano]] or [[dried mixed herbs]]\n| 2 tablespoons fresh [[Basil leaves|basil leaves]], chopped, if available\n| 1 large can [[Plum|plum]] [[Tomatoes|tomatoes]], chopped\n| 500ml to 600 ml of the water the [[Chicken|chicken]] was [[Boiled|boiled]] in\n| 1 tablespoon [[Worcester sauce|Worcester sauce]]\n| [[Chillies]], [[chilli sauce]] or [[chilli powder]] to add warmth, not heat.\n|* I used: 1 teaspoon chili guajillo (powder), 2 teaspoons pasilla chili (diced), 1/2 a teaspoon of chipotle chillies (diced)\n|* Suggested alternative if using sauce: 1 to 2 tablespoons [[Louisiana hot pepper sauce]] (or to taste)\n| [[Sea Salt|sea salt]] and [[Freshly ground black pepper|freshly ground black pepper]]\n| 400 g (14 oz) [[Basmati rice|basmati rice]] ([[Long grain rice|long grain rice]])\n}}\n''' Garnish'''\n* Finely chopped [[Parsley|parsley]]\n\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Remove any giblets, cut off and discard the [[Parson's nose]].\n| Wash the [[Chicken|chicken]] under cold running water, inside and out\n| Place the [[Chicken|chicken]] in a large pot and pour over just enough [[Boiling|boiling]] water to cover\n| Add the [[Onion|onion]] and the [[Bay leaf|bay leaf]] and [[Boil|boil]] for about 1 hour or until tender\n| Set the [[Chicken|chicken]] to one side, reserve the [[Stock|stock]] and discard the [[Bay leaf|bay leaf]] and [[Onion|onion]] quarters\n| Once chicken has cooled discard skin and bone\n| Heat the [[Butter|butter]] in a large pan and [[Fry|fry]] the [[Garlic|garlic]] for a few minutes\n| Add the [[Ham|ham]], [[Spring onions|spring onions]], [[Celery|celery]] and [[Pepper|pepper]] and [[Saut\u00e9|saut\u00e9]] for 5 minutes\n| Rinse rice under cold running water for a few minutes until the water runs clear\n| Add the [[Rice|rice]] and [[Stir-fry|stir-fry]] for a minute so the grains are coated by the oil\n| Add the [[Stock|stock]] (about 500 ml to start), [[Tomatoes|tomatoes]], [[Spices|spices]], [[Worcester sauce|Worcester sauce]], [[Hot pepper sauce|hot pepper sauce]], [[Salt|salt]] and [[Pepper|pepper]] and [[Chicken|chicken]]\n| Stir well, cover and [[Simmer|simmer]] on a very low hob until the liquid has gone and the [[Rice|rice]] is cooked.  Add a little more water if it dries out before the rice is done.\n}}\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Chicken jambalaya in pot.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Chicken jambalaya, ready to cook\nImage:Chicken jambalaya boil.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Chicken, ready to boil\n</gallery>\n===Variations===\nI raided the garden for anything to add to the chicken boil: a few [[carrots]], some [[leeks]] a few spare sticks of [[celery]] and bunches of [[parsley]].\n===Chef's notes===\nI have doubled the rice quantity from the original recipe as there was so little rice.  I have not quite doubled the stock quantity so keep an eye on the water level to ensure that it does not dry out.\n\nRather than using [[chili sauce]] for the heat I used a mixture of my [[Exotic chili powders]] to add more than just heat.  The quantities I used did not make this hot (like a chili), just a little warmth.\n\nThe [[stock]] left from cooking the chicken is really good quality so whatever you don't use, freeze in bags or cups far later use.\n\n==See also==\n* http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jambalaya\n* http://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/1167651/chicken-and-chorizo-jambalaya\n* http://www.deliaonline.com/recipes/type-of-dish/one-pot-meals/chicken-jambalaya.html\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes|Jambalaya]]\n[[Category:Historic recipes|Jambalaya]]\n[[Category:Indian recipes|Jambalaya]]\n[[Category:Main courses|Jambalaya]]\n[[Category:Poultry recipes|Jambalaya]]\n[[Category:Rice recipes|Jambalaya]]\n[[Category:Spicy recipes|Jambalaya]]\n[[Category:Tex-Mex recipes|Jambalaya]]\n[[Category:North American recipes|Jambalaya]]\n[[Category:Favourite recipes]]\n[[Category:Boiled or simmered]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#chickenjambalaya #chicken #stock #onion #bayleaf #celery #rice #worchestersauce #ham #butter #parsley </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
