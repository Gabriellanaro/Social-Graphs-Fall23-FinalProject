It's the [[masa harina]] that gives them that unique flavour.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| &#189; cup of [[Vegetable oil|vegetable oil]]\n| 1 pack of soft [[Corn tortillas|corn tortillas]] (8 to 10 tortillas)\n| Fine [[Salt|salt]]\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Cut the each [[Corn tortillas|corn tortilla]] into 6 triangles\n| Heat the [[Oil|oil]] in a large heavy based [[Frying pan|frying pan]] over a medium heat.\n| Add the triangles in small batches and [[Fry|fry]] for about a minute or until they just start to [[Brown|brown]].  You need to be quick as they can burn easily.\n| Lift the cooked [[Chips|chips]] out of the pan and let the [[Oil|oil]] drain and then stack on paper towels to remove excess oil.\n| Sprinkle with a pinch of [[Salt|salt]].\n| Allow to cool and crisp-up a little before serving.\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nTry one of our [[Salsa|salsa recipes]] or this [[Tex-Mex bean dip for tacos]].\n===Chef's notes===\nFor health reasons, I have used [[Olive oil|olive oil]].\n\nYou could possibly fry the whole tortilla first and then cut into triangles as they remain soft for a ref minutes after frying.  I will try that next time I make these.\n{{Tortillas-See also}}\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Latin American recipes]]\n[[Category:Mexican recipes]]\n[[Category:North American recipes]]\n[[Category:Tex-Mex recipes]]\n[[Category:Bread and baking]]\n[[Category:Snacks and light bites]]\n[[Category:Starters]]\n[[Category:Tapas, mezze and antipasti]]\n[[Category:Vegan recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes]]\n[[Category:Cookery cheats]]\n[[Category:Favourite recipes]]\n[[Category:Pan fried]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#corntortillas #homemadetortillachips #vegetableoil #chips #tortillachips #oliveoil #masaharina #panfried #corntortillarecipe #salsa #fry </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
