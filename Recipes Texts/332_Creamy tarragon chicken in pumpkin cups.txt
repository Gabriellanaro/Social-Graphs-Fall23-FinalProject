It would be fine by just heating the [[Soup|soup]], and mixing in the [[Chicken|chicken]], providing it is properly cooked.  [[Slow cooking]] for a few hours just allows the flavours to properly mingle, providing you have the time. \n\nYou could possibly cook the [[Chicken|chicken]] filling in the [[Squash|squash]] or [[Pumpkin|pumpkin]], but there is always the risk of the body of the squash collapsing and dumping the filling all over your [[Oven|oven]] - this way is far safer!  It's also easier to check that the pumpkin is properly cooked.\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| 100g [[Bacon lardons|bacon lardons]]\n| 1 tablespoon [[Olive oil|olive oil]]\n| Pinch of [[Black pepper|black pepper]]\n| 1 small [[Onion|onion]], peeled, halved and chopped\n| 4 [[Cloves of Garlic, peeled and crushed|cloves of garlic, peeled and crushed]]\n| A pinch of [[Tex-Mex seasoning]] (optional)\n| 2 small [[Chicken breasts|chicken breasts]], chopped into bite-sized pieces\n| 1 can of [[Cream of mushroom soup|cream of mushroom soup]]\n| Splash of [[Dry sherry|dry sherry]] (optional)\n| 1 teaspoon [[Dried tarragon|dried tarragon]]\n| 1 medium sized [[Pumpkin|pumpkin]] or [[Squash|squash]] (think how it would make 2 small bowls if it were cut in two)\n| 2 tablespoons of Dzuigas [[Cheese|cheese]], finely [[Grated|grated]] (optional)\n}}\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n\n* Preheat your [[Oven|oven]] to 180\u00b0 C (350\u00b0 F - gas 4), [fan oven 160\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Pumpkins scooped out and ready to bake.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Pumpkins scooped out and ready to bake\nImage:Tarragon chicken filling.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Sauteed chicken filling\n</gallery>\n\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| Add the [[Olive oil|olive oil]], [[Black pepper|black pepper]] and [[Lardons|lardons]] to a [[Frying pan|frying pan]] or [[Wok|wok]] and [[Saute|saute]] gently for 5 minutes\n| Add the [[Onions|onions]] and chopped [[Chicken|chicken]] and [[Saute|saute]] for a further 5 minutes, add the [[Garlic|garlic]] for the last few minutes, mixing well\n| Open the [[Soup|soup]] and pour into your [[Slow cooker|slow cooker]], rinse the tin out with a splash of [[Sherry|sherry]] if you have some\n| Add the [[Chicken|chicken]] mix to the [[Soup|soup]] and slow cook for a few hours\n| Meanwhile, carefully cut the [[Squash|squash]] or [[Pumpkin|pumpkin]] in half, through the stem.  [[Scoop]] out and discard the [[Seeds|seeds]]\n| [[Bake]] in the [[Oven|oven]] at  , [[Scoop|scoop]] the [[Seeds|seeds]] and bak in the oven at 180\u00b0 C for about an hour - the timing will vary depending upon the type of [[Squash|squash]]\n| If it looks as if the 'soup' might need thickening, stir in a tablespoon of [[yellow cornmeal]] and mix well during the last 15 minutes of cooking.\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe the [[Tarragon|tarragon]] [[Chicken|chicken]] directly in the [[Pumpkin|pumpkin]] bowls, each sprinkled with a tablespoon of [[D\u017eiugas cheese]]. \n===Variations===\nUse any form of [[Squash|squash]] or [[Pumpkin|pumpkin]]; [[Butternut squash|butternut squash]] would be great, but you would need a large one to serve as a bowl.\n\nA good [[Parmesan cheese]] would be a fair substitute for [[D\u017eiugas cheese]].\n===Chef's notes===\nThis was absolutely delicious and will be made again and again!\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:North American recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:Poultry recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegetable recipes]]\n[[Category:Cookery cheats]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n[[Category:Pan fried]]\n[[Category:Favourite recipes]]\n[[Category:Slow cooked]]\n[[Category:D\u017eiugas cheese recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#pumpkin #chicken #squash #soup #blackpepper #seeds #saute #oliveoil #creamytarragonchickeninpumpkincups #scoop #slowcooker </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
