Reserve.\n| Place the [[Salmon fillets|salmon fillets]] in a flat dish and add a little [[Milk|milk]] just so the [[Salmon|salmon]] stays moist.\n| Halve the [[Pumpkin|pumpkin]] and remove the [[Seeds|seeds]], leave the skin on as it's easier to remove the flesh after cooking than it is to peel first.\n| Cut a few slashes in the [[Squash|squash]], drizzle with [[Olive oil|olive oil]] and season well\n| [[Roast]] in the top of the [[Oven|oven]] for 30 minutes or until the flesh is soft\n| After the [[Squash|squash]] has been [[Roasting|roasting]] for 15 minutes, [[Bake|bake]] the [[Salmon|salmon]], covered, in the bottom of the [[Oven|oven]] for the last 15 minutes.\n| Scoop the [[Pumpkin|pumpkin]] flesh into a bowl, add the [[Butter|butter]], [[onions]], [[Lemon juice|lemon juice]] seasoning and [[chili flakes]].
