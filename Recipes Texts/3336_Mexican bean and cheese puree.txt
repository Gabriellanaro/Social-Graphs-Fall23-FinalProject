Skim any scum that appears on the surface.\n| Drain the beans and return to the pan. Pour 1.5 tablespoons of [[Oil|oil]] over the beans, add the onion pieces and the stock. Bring to the boil, cover and reduce to a simmer.\n| [[Simmer]] for about 30 minutes or until they are softening and the skins beginning to [[Split|split]].\n| Add the 100 ml of olive oil to a [[Casserole dish|casserole dish]] and place in the oven whilst it is preheating.\n| Add the [[Salt|salt]] and continue to [[Simmer|simmer]] for another 35 minutes until the [[Beans|beans]] become a mush.  this time will very depending upon the type of bean.\n| If they dry out during this stage add a little more [[Stock|stock]].\n| Remove the [[Beans|beans]] from the heat, drain them and using a [[Food processor|food processor]], blend them to a pur\u00e9e with the [[Milk|milk]] and [[chillies]].\n| Taste for seasoning and add [[Tabasco sauce]] to taste if using.\n| Once the [[Oven|oven]] is hot, carefully stir the [[Bean|bean]] pur\u00e9e into the hot [[Oil|oil]] and mix very well.  Don't be concerned about the obvious amount of excess oil, this will absorb into the bean mixture during the last 15 minutes of cooking. \n| Return the [[Casserole|casserole]] of [[Beans|beans]] to the [[Oven|oven]] and [[Bake|bake]] the [[Puree|puree]] for about 45 minutes to 1 hour.\n| By now the [[Beans|beans]] should be [[Drying|drying]] out at the edges, don't add any more [[Stock|stock]] at this stage.\n| Sprinkle the [[Beans|beans]] with the [[Grated|grated]] [[Cheese|cheese]] and return to the [[Oven|oven]] for 15 minutes or until melted.\n| Serve directly.\n}}\n===Variations===\nI like to fiddle with my recipes and encouraged by the recent success [[Dal makhani]], I also added 3 fat crushed cloves of [[Garlic|garlic]] and 200 ml of chopped tomatoes at the blending stage.\n\n[[Dried|dried]] [[Kidney beans|kidney beans]], [[chick peas]] or any similar dried [[Bean|bean]] work fine in this recipe.\n\nI think that [[yogurt]] would work just as well as [[milk]] too.\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe with [[soured cream]] and plain [[tortilla chips]] to use as edible spoons!\n===Chef's notes===\nI used [[dried black lentils]] for the beans and for health reasons, [[olive oil]] for the vegetable oil as this recipe uses rather a lot. For the cheese I used a mixture of mature [[gouda]] and mature [[cheddar]].\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Mexican recipes]]\n[[Category:Tex-Mex recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Snacks and light bites]]\n[[Category:Starters]]\n[[Category:Tapas, mezze and antipasti]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes]]\n[[Category:Cheese recipes]]\n[[Category:Grain and bean recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegetable recipes]]\n[[Category:Favourite recipes]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#beans #mexicanbeanandcheesepuree #oliveoil #simmer #grated #bean #stock #chillies #tabascosauce #mexican #mexico </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
