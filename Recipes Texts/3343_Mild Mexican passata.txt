A great recipe in which to try out any of your dried mild [[chillies]].\n\nThe pasilla gave it a really nice bitter chocolaty flavour.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 500g packet or bottle of [[passata]], (about 500 ml)\n| 2 or 3 [[Spring onions, chopped|spring onions, chopped]]\n| 1 [[Dried|dried]] [[chilli pasilla]], deseeded and finely chopped\n| 1 large [[red banana pepper]] (a normal [[red bell pepper]] would be fine)\n| A shake of [[Louisiana hot pepper sauce]] or [[Tabasco sauce]]\n\n}}\n\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n* Soak the [[Dried|dried]] [[Pepper|pepper]] in half a cup of [[Boiling|boiling]] water for 15 minutes to rehydrate it\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Add all of the ingredients to a pan and heat through.  Add a little extra water if it looks too thick for your recipe.\n| As I had plenty of time when I made this, I did not rehydrate the [[Chilli|chilli]] first. I crushed the [[dried pasilla chilli]], discarded the seeds, added everything to a pan, heated it up, left it for an hour or two and then reheated to serve.\n}}\n==See also==\n* [[Chilli sauce|Many other chilli sauce recipes]]\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Mexican recipes]]\n[[Category:Tex-Mex recipes]]\n[[Category:Accompaniments]]\n[[Category:Dips and sauces]]\n[[Category:Spicy recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegan recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes]]\n[[Category:Chilli pepper recipes]]\n[[Category:Fruit recipes]]\n[[Category:Boiled or simmered]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#mildmexicanpassata #dried #passata #redbellpepper #chilli #mexican #boiledorsimmered #chillipasilla #miseenplace #driedpasillachilli #tabascosauce </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
