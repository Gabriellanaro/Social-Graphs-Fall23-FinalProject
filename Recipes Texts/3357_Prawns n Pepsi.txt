If you are uncertain as to how hot this dish will be for you, don't add the seeds, reserve them, taste the sauce after 15 minutes and add them if you need more heat. Wear rubber gloves when handling [[chillies]].\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Chilli pepper recipes]]\n[[Category:Garlic recipes]]\n[[Category:Fish recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Shellfish recipes]]\n[[Category:Spicy recipes]]\n[[Category:Tex-Mex recipes]]\n[[Category:North American recipes]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#prawnsnpepsi #sauce #garlic #prawns #fry #lime #chillies #tomatoes #pepsi #butter #onions </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
