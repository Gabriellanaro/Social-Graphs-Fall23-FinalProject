They are frequently confused with [[Quesadillas|quesadillas]], due to their resemblance to \"quesadillas\" sold in the United States. (U.S. quesadillas are usually made with [[Flour tortillas|flour tortillas]] rather than molded from [[Masa|masa]] in the [[Mexican]] style).\n\nSincronizadas (so called because the top and bottom [[Tortilla|tortilla]] are \"synchronized\" together) [[Sandwich|sandwich]] ingredients between two [[Tortillas|tortillas]]. The sandwich is then [[Grilled|grilled]].\n\n=== The difference between Sincronizadas & [[quesadillas]] ===\n''This is only a rough guide, there are many, many regional differences.''\n* Sincronizadas usually include [[Ham|ham]]\n* Sincronizadas are usually made with [[Wheat flour|wheat flour]] [[tortillas]]\n* Sincronizadas are usually served flat, cut into segments\n* [[Quesadillas]] are usually made with [[corn tortillas]], though can be made with [[flour tortillas]]\n* As well as [[cheese]], [[Quesadillas]] can often contain, meat, [[refried beans]] and vegetables.\n* [[Quesadillas]] are often rolled before serving.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 4 soft [[Flour tortillas|flour tortillas]]\n| 1 cup [[Grated|grated]] [[Cheese|cheese]].\n| 70g strong [[Cheddar]]. ''Original recipes suggest [[Oaxaca cheese]] or [[Monterey Jack cheese]]''.\n| 4 slices of thinly sliced [[Ham|ham]] or [[Prosciutto|prosciutto]], cut into strips\n| 2 red [[Hot chillies|hot chillies]], de-seeded and thinly sliced (or to taste)\n|* You can use [[Chilli|chilli]] [[Sauce|sauce]] instead if you prefer\n| A few thinly cut slices of fresh [[Tomato|tomato]]\n| A few rings of thinly sliced [[Onions|onions]]\n| A handful of [[Coriander|coriander]] or [[Parsley leaves|parsley leaves]], chopped finely\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Lay two of the [[Tortillas|tortillas]] side-by-side on a flat surface and sprinkle with half of the [[Cheese|cheese]]\n| Layer the half of [[Ham|ham]] on to the [[Cheese|cheese]]\n| Distribute the remaining ingredients apart from the [[Cheese|cheese]] and [[Ham|ham]]\n| Top with the remaining [[Ham|ham]] and [[Cheese|cheese]]\n| Complete the 'sandwiches' by covering with the [[Tortillas|tortillas]]\n| On a [[Griddle|griddle]] or a large [[Frying pan|frying pan]], cook the sincronizadas, one at-a-time until the [[Tortillas|tortillas]] are lightly [[Browned|browned]] and starting to become crispy, turning once\n| Cut each sincronizada into 6 quadrants\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe hot with [[Guacamole|guacamole]] and a [[Green salad|green salad]]\n===Variations===\nChange the [[Cheddar cheese]] for a Mexican type of cheese that is called [[Oaxaca cheese|\"quesillo/queso oaxaca\"]] which can be easily torn into thinner strands and melts faster. \n\nI usually put some mayonnaise on the tortillas then the ham,cheese, a bit of fried beans, and cover it with the other tortilla with mayonnaise and another slice of ham. -- [[User:Pepekike]] 04:28, 21 July 2011 \n{{Tortillas-See also}}\n* [[Talk:Sincronizada_recipe|Visitor comments]] relating to this recipe\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Cheese recipes]]\n[[Category:Latin American recipes]]\n[[Category:Chilli pepper recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Mexican recipes]]\n[[Category:Snacks and light bites]]\n[[Category:North American recipes]]\n[[Category:Spicy recipes]]\n[[Category:Starters]]\n[[Category:Tex-Mex recipes]]\n[[Category:Pan fried]]\n[[Category:Grilled, griddled or barbecued]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#cheese #ham #quesadillas #tortillas #sincronizadarecipe #flourtortillas #tortilla #sandwich #grilled #masa #cheddar </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
