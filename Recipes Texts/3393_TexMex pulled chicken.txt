Using a medium chicken and lots of home made salsa it would probably stretch to 6 people.  I added crushed new potatoes to the wrap, just because we had some spare - that helped to bulk it out and made it a little different.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 2 tablespoons [[Olive oil|olive oil]]\n| 1 [[Onion|onion]], peeled and sliced\n| 2 Cloves of [[Garlic|garlic]], peeled and crushed\n| 1 teaspoon white [[Cumin seeds|cumin seeds]] [[Ground|ground]] to powder\n| &#189; teaspoon [[Chilli powder|chilli powder]] (or to taste)\n| &#189; teaspoon [[Mustard powder|mustard powder]]\n| &#189; teaspoon [[Garlic powder|garlic powder]]\n| &#189; teaspoon [[Ginger powder|ginger powder]]\n| 1 teaspoon [[Coriander seeds|coriander seeds]], [[Ground|ground]] to powder\n| 1 teaspoon of [[paprika powder]], [[smoked paprika powder]] is even better if you have it.\n| Pinch of [[Ground cinnamon|ground cinnamon]] powder\n|* Note to self: go easy on the [[cinnamon]]!\n| 1kg [[Chicken|chicken]] pieces for four people, skin removed - one medium 1.3kg [[chicken, jointed]], is ideal.\n| [[Sea Salt|sea salt]] and [[Freshly ground black pepper|freshly ground black pepper]] to taste\n| 2 teaspoons of [[muscovado sugar]] or [[brown sugar]]\n| 190 ml (3/4 cup) cup of [[Tomato salsa|tomato salsa]], you can make your own here but bottled [[Salsa|salsa]] is still pretty good\n| 250 ml (1 cup) [[Chicken stock|chicken stock]]\n| [[Juice]] and [[Zest|zest]] of &#189; a [[Lime|lime]]\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Heat the [[Olive oil|olive oil]] in a pan and gently saut\u00e9 the [[Onion|onion]] and [[Garlic|garlic]] until it is translucent - about 6 minutes\n| Add the [[Spices|spices]] and [[Stir-fry|stir-fry]] for a few minutes\n| Mix in the [[Chicken|chicken]], [[Salsa|salsa]] [[brown sugar]] and [[Chicken stock|chicken stock]], bring to the [[Boil|boil]] then reduce to a [[Simmer|simmer]]\n| Cover and cook for 40 minutes then remove the [[Chicken|chicken]] pieces from the pot and allow to cool a little\n| Leave the cover off the pan and continue [[Simmering|simmering]] the [[Sauce|sauce]] until it is reduced by more than half and most of the sauce has gone - probably another 30 minutes.\n| Meanwhile use 2 forks and shred the [[Meat|meat]] from the [[bones]]\n| Once the [[Sauce|sauce]] has reduced, add back the [[Chicken|chicken]], mix in the [[Lime juice|lime juice]] and [[Zest|zest]] and season to taste\n}}\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Tex-Mex pulled chicken reduced.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Pulled chicken - after reducing the sauce and adding back the shredded chicken\nImage:Tex-Mex pulled chicken sauce.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The sauce after about 20 minutes\n</gallery>\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe on [[Tortillas|tortillas]] or similar [[Flat breads|flat breads]]\nGarnish with [[Avocado|avocado]] slices, slices of lime, [[Soured cream|soured cream]] and salad leaves\n===Variations===\nThis makes a great [[Sandwich|sandwich]] filler too.\n===Chef's notes===\nAs I almost invariably do after jointing a chicken, I cut slashes all over the chicken pieces; refrigerate and marinade them in the juice of a lime and a big pinch of salt.  It's a habit picked up from an Indian cookery course that seems to make chicken very tender and tasty.\n==See also==\n* {{See also - Jointing a chicken}}\n{{Template:PeelingGinger}}\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Tex-Mex recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Spicy recipes]]\n[[Category:Chilli pepper recipes]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:Poultry recipes]]\n[[Category:Favourite recipes]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]][[Category:Stewed, braised or pot roasted]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#texmexpulledchicken #chicken #brownsugar #garlic #sauce #onion #oliveoil #ground #salsa #zest #chickenstock </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
