It's easy, allows you to tailor it to your taste.  The recipe is easy to adjust to make different quantities.\n\nThe Main ingredients that give that authentic flavour are the [[oregano]], [[cumin seeds]] and [[chili powder]].  I would suggest you keep those at the levels here and adjust the other items if you have a desire to tinker.\n\nEverything is in teaspoons to make it easy to make different quantities - use tablespoons at the same rate to make more.\n===Commercially available Tex-Mex seasoning===\nI also use ready made seasoning mixes, but the one I had been using changed and was far too salty so I went in search of another supplier.  This let to my discovery of [[Taste Sensation Ltd]].  if you love your spices and seasonings, take a look at them.  They sell them directly and via [https://www.amazon.co.uk/stores/TasteSensation/node/4434351031 Amazon UK] and I can thoroughly recommend them.  Also, Nick Lumby, who has run the company for 20 years, is a really nice guy!\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 2 teaspoons [[chili powder]] or chili flakes or crushed dried chillies\n| 2 teaspoons [[paprika powder]]\n| 2 teaspoons dried [[Mexican oregano]] or [[oregano]] leaves\n| 3 teaspoons [[dried garlic granules]] or [[Garlic|garlic]] powder\n| 1 teaspoon [[sea salt]]\n| 6 teaspoons [[white cumin]] seeds\n| 5 teaspoons [[onion]] powder or dried onion flakes\n}}\n\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Grind all the ingredients to powder in a [[coffee grinder]]\n| Mix together well if you had to do this in batches\n}}\n===Chef's notes===\n\nStore in an airtight container out of the light.\n\n35 g of this spice mix is sufficient to season; [[chicken]], [[pork]], [[beef]] for four people.  Rub the mix on the [[meat]], coat well with a tablespoon of [[vegetable oil]] and 1 tablespoon [[lemon juice]] and marinate for 2 hours.\n\nI've recently discovered [[Old India Taco Seasoning]], which saves me from makling this.  It's sold in 500g quantities, which last us about 4 months!  Wonderful stuff.  Give it a try.\n\nA good [[:Category:Indian ingredients (supplier)|Asian grocer / wholesaler]] will [[stock]] all of the ingredients for this recipe, and a whole lot more besides!\n{{Tortillas-See also}}\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Chilli pepper recipes]]\n[[Category:Marinades dressings and butters]]\n[[Category:Spicy recipes]]\n[[Category:Tex-Mex recipes]]\n[[Category:North American recipes]]\n[[Category:Spices]]\n[[Category:Uncooked]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#texmexseasoning #chilipowder #oregano #vegetableoil #paprikapowder #whitecumin #stock #driedgarlicgranules #garlic #coffeegrinder #beef </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
