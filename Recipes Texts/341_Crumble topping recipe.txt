I have created this recipe separately as Mum wanted me to make her some crumble on its own!\n\nAs a basic rule use 4 parts flour, to 2 parts butter and 2 parts sugar, using less sugar as taste demands.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 285g (10&frac12; oz) [[Plain flour|plain flour]]\n| 150g (5oz) [[Butter|butter]] (preferably unsalted) at room temperature, cut into small cubes.  \n|* [[Stork margarine]] is also good for this recipe.\n| 150g (5oz)  unrefined [[Brown sugar|brown sugar]], [[Muscovado]] etc.\n| Pinch of [[Cinnamon|cinnamon]] powder or [[Ginger powder|ginger powder]]\n}}\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n* Preheat the [[Oven|oven]] to 180\u00b0 C (350\u00b0 F - gas 4)\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n|By hand\n| Sift the [[Plain flour|plain flour]] into a large bowl and sprinkle with [[Sugar|sugar]], [[Salt|salt]] and spices if using.\n| With 'light-hands', gradually rub the [[Butter|butter]] into the [[Flour|flour]] a few cubes at a time until the mixture resembles [[Breadcrumbs|breadcrumbs]]\n| Don't over-work it or it will become a useless [[Dough|dough]].\n| With a [[food processor]]\n| Add the flour and butter to a [[food processor]] with a plastic blade attachment\n| Pulse the mixture in very short bursts, regularly opening and scraping any residue from the edge of the bowl if as it forms\n| Once it resembles breadcrumbs sprinkle in the [[sugar]] and pulse until combined.\n| Don't run it continuously or you will end up with pastry\n| Break up any lumps with your fingers before sprinkling and baking.\n| Normally you would spoon this mixture over the [[Fruit|fruit]], if, unusually, you are making it on its own, sprinkle over a lightly buttered 24 cm (9\") [[Oven|oven]]-proof dish\n| [[Bake]] in the [[Oven|oven]] for 35 to 40 minutes - keep your eye on it for the last 10 minutes, the transition time between done and burnt is short!\n}}\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Crumble topping recipe breadcrumbs.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Rubbed into 'breadcrumbs'\nImage:Crumble topping ingredients.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Crumble topping - basic ingredients\n</gallery>\n===Variations===\nDepending upon your taste, use less sugar. This recipe is fairly sweet for my taste. \n\nFor a nice change, add a little [[Rolled oats|rolled oats]] for [[Cornflakes|cornflakes]] to the mixture before [[Baking|baking]].\n==See also==\n* [[Mango and ginger crumble]]\n* [[Apple crumble recipe]]\n* [[Apple crumble recipe (Mum's)]]\n* [[Crumble topping recipe|Traditional crumble topping]]\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Bread and baking]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Historic recipes]]\n[[Category:Pies tarts and flans]]\n[[Category:Sweets and desserts]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#crumbletoppingrecipe #fruit #plainflour #foodprocessor #butter #brownsugar #gingerpowder #flour #breadcrumbs #applecrumblerecipe #rolledoats </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
