Its main ingredients are [[Chillies|piri piri chili peppers]], [[Chillies|serrano peppers]] or other [[Chillies|hot chili peppers]], combined with [[spices]] and [[herbs]] such as [[garlic]], [[coriander]] and [[cumin]].\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 100g g (4 oz) dried hot red [[Chillies|red chili peppers]], ideally [[Bird's eye chili peppers]]\n| 2 teaspoons sea [[salt]]\n| 6 [[Garlic|garlic]] cloves, chopped \n| 2 teaspoons freshly ground [[Cumin|cumin]]\n| 1 teaspoon freshly ground [[black cumin]] seeds\n| 2 teaspoons freshly ground [[caraway seeds]] (optional)\n| 1 chopped, skinned and de-seeded red [[bell pepper]]\n| 1 teaspoon smoked [[paprika]]\n| 2 teaspoons red wine or [[sherry]] vinegar\n| 2 teaspoons [[tomato puree]]\n| Juice and zest from half a [[lemon]] or lime\n| Half of one [[Preserved_lemons|salted lemon]] (optional)\n| [[Olive oil]] to cover paste to assist preservation\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| As already stated, '''ensure the kitchen is well ventilated!'''\n| In a small pan, cover the dried chillies with water, bring to the boil and simmer for 10 minutes\n| Remove from the heat and let it rest for an hour\n| Drain the chillies\n| Place chillies in a food processor with the [[Garlic|garlic]], tomato puree, vinegar, salt and spices\n| Blend to a paste adding the [[lemon]] juice, little by little, until you have the desired consistency\n| Place into a [[sterilised jar]]\n| Add enough [[olive oil]] to cover the paste and prevent it from being exposed to air.\n| Screw on lid tightly and refrigerate\n}}\n===Servings===\nServings: 100 - Makes 1 jar of very hot, very yummy chili paste\n===Variations===\nReduce the salt by half and add the rind and flesh of half a [[Preserved_lemons|preserved lemon]]\n===Chef's notes===\nHandling this amount of [[dried chillies]] at once can be a bit nasty. The dust and vapour that they may give off can make breathing difficult. I'm still coughing half an hour after making this batch. Don't let this put you off though, just take the following precautions.\n# Ensure the kitchen is well ventilated and hold your breath when rinsing out the food processor.\n# Keeps pets out of the kitchen whilst you are making this.\n# Wear rubber gloves if your skin is sensitive\n\nIf your mouth burns after eating harissa, or any other hot sauce, drink plenty of [[milk]] or [[yogurt]].\n\nDrinking water tends to make thing worse, not better.\n\nBecause harissa paste is water based, it will won't keep for long periods, even if refrigerated.  Keeping the surface covered with oil helps to prolong its life a little, however, having made, and consumed litres of my homemade harissa paste, I think I have come up with the way of storing it:\n\n# Once made, only bottle what you are likely to consume within 1 month.  refrigerate and always ensure that it is well covered with oil.\n# Divide the remaining harissa paste into freezer bags about the same size as your fridge bottle and freeze.\n# Refill your fridge bottle with [[defrosted]] harissa paste as your fridge supply runs out.\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[Chilli sauce|Many other chili sauce recipes]]\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes|Harissa paste]]\n[[Category:Dips and sauces|Harissa paste]]\n[[Category:North African recipes|Harissa paste]]\n[[Category:Condiments|Harissa paste]]\n[[Category:Cooking with wine]]\n[[Category:Tunisian recipes|Harissa paste]]\n[[Category:Spicy recipes]]\n[[Category:Chilli pepper recipes|Chili pepper recipes]]\n[[Category:Boiled or simmered]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#harissapaste #chillies #garlic #oliveoil #preserved_lemons #cumin #lemon #coriander #sterilisedjar #spices #carawayseeds </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
