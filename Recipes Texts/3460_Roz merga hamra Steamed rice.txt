The method given below assumes that like me, you are unable to get your hands on a [[couscoussier]].  However, if you have one, then do use it!\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 5 tablespoons [[Oil|oil]]\n| 900 g [[Lamb|lamb]], [[Beef|beef]] or [[Veal|veal]], cut into 5 cm cubes\n| 1 medium [[Onion|onion]], finely chopped\n| [[Garlic]] to taste, finely chopped\n| 1 teaspoon [[Paprika|paprika]]\n| &frac12; teaspoon [[Harissa|harissa]]\n| &frac12; teaspoon [[Baharat|baharat]]\n| 1&frac12; teaspoons [[Salt|salt]]\n| &frac12; teaspoon [[Ground black pepper|ground black pepper]]\n| 2 large [[Tomatoes, peeled|tomatoes, peeled]] and chopped\n| 1 tablespoon [[Tomato|tomato]] pur\u00e9e diluted in 75 ml water\n| 2-3 [[Carrots|carrots]], scraped and cut into 1 cm rounds\n| 1.2 [[Litres|litres]] water or light [[Meat stock|meat stock]]\n| 2 [[Bay leaves|bay leaves]]\n| 500 g [[Long grain rice|long grain rice]], washed thoroughly under cold running water\n| 2 medium [[Courgettes|courgettes]], sliced into 1 cm rounds\n| 2 [[Potatoes|potatoes]], peeled and cut into 5 cm pieces\n| 50 g [[Butter|butter]]\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Heat the [[Oil|oil]] and a large saucepan and add the [[Meat|meat]], [[Onion|onion]] and [[Garlic|garlic]] and [[Fry|fry]] for about 5 minutes, stirring often.\n| Stir in the [[Paprika|paprika]], [[Harissa|harissa]], [[Baharat|baharat]], [[Salt|salt]], [[Pepper|pepper]], [[Tomatoes|tomatoes]] and [[Tomato|tomato]] pur\u00e9e and [[Fry|fry]] for 2-3 minutes.\n| Add the [[Carrots|carrots]], water or [[Stock|stock]] and [[Bay leaves|bay leaves]] and bring to the [[Boil|boil]].\n| Place a [[Muslin|muslin]] lined [[Colander|colander]] over the top of the saucepan.\n| Pour some [[Boiling|boiling]] water over the [[Rice|rice]] and put it in the [[Colander|colander]].\n| Cover, reduce the heat and [[Simmer|simmer]] for about 45 minutes, occasionally stirring the [[Rice|rice]].\n| Add the [[Courgettes|courgettes]] and [[Potatoes|potatoes]] to the [[Stew|stew]].\n| Cut the [[Butter|butter]] and stir into the [[Rice|rice]].\n| Continue to cook, covered, for a further 15-20 minutes until the [[Meat|meat]], [[Vegetables|vegetables]] and [[Rice|rice]] are tender, stirring the rice from time to time.\n| Spread the [[Rice|rice]] over the bottom of a large serving dish and arrange the [[Stew|stew]] over the top.\n}}\n===Variations===\nIn Tunisia they would sprinkle 2-3 tablespoons of [[Grated|grated]] [[Cheese|cheese]], such as [[Parmesan]] or [[Cheddar]], on the top of the [[Stew|stew]].\n===Chef's notes===\nI would use a very loose weave [[Muslin|muslin]] for steaming the rice or it will not cook.  Alternatively, steam the rice in a [[chinois]] without lining with [[Muslin|muslin]].  I will advise further about making this using a [[couscoussier]]. \n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes|Roz merga hamra (steamed rice)]]\n[[Category:Beef recipes|Roz merga hamra (steamed rice)]]\n[[Category:Cheese recipes|Roz merga hamra (steamed rice)]]\n[[Category:Garlic recipes|Roz merga hamra (steamed rice)]]\n[[Category:Lamb recipes|Roz merga hamra (steamed rice)]]\n[[Category:Libyan recipes|Roz merga hamra (steamed rice)]]\n[[Category:Main courses|Roz merga hamra (steamed rice)]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes|Roz merga hamra (steamed rice)]]\n[[Category:North African recipes|Roz merga hamra (steamed rice)]]\n[[Category:Potato recipes|Roz merga hamra (steamed rice)]]\n[[Category:Spicy recipes|Roz merga hamra (steamed rice)]]\n[[Category:Stews and casseroles|Roz merga hamra (steamed rice)]]\n[[Category:Tunisian recipes]]\n[[Category:Veal recipes|Roz merga hamra (steamed rice)]]\n[[Category:Vegetable recipes|Roz merga hamra (steamed rice)]]\n[[Category:Steamed]]\n\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#rice #stew #muslin #potatoes #onion #paprika #butter #tomato #carrots #bayleaves #fry </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
