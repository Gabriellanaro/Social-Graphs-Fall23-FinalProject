Maureen's original recipe was created as a way to get her children to eat [[Vegetables|vegetables]], but my adaptation is more gutsy.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 2 tablespoons [[Peanut|peanut]] or other [[Oil|oil]]\n| 1 large Spanish [[Onions|onion]], peeled and [[Diced|diced]]\n| 4 bulbs [[Garlic|garlic]], peeled and [[Diced|diced]]\n| 300 g [[Carrots|carrots]], scraped and sliced\n| 220 g [[Swede|swede]], peeled and cubed\n| 550 g [[Potatoes|potatoes]]\n| A pinch of sugar\n| 150 g [[Orange|orange]] [[Lentils|lentils]]\n| 1&frac12; teaspoons [[curry spice mix]] 1\n| 4 teaspoons [[curry spice mix]] 2\n| 1.4 [[Litres|litres]] [[Vegetable Stock|vegetable stock]]\n| 350 g [[Brussels sprouts|Brussels sprouts]], trimmed and cleaned\n| Seasoning\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Heat the [[Oil|oil]] over a high heat in a large pan.\n| Add the [[Onions|onions]], [[Garlic|garlic]], [[Carrots|carrots]], [[Swede|swede]] and [[Potatoes|potatoes]], reduce the heat to low and stir.\n| Cover, and allow to [[Stew|stew]] until the [[Onions|onions]] are soft.

Froxen  [[Tex-Mex]] spice mix etc.  Frozen [[Brussels sprouts]] are fine, but add them about 10 minutes before the end of the stimated cooking time.  The [[soup]] can be left as it is or can be liquidised.\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes|Curried lentil and vegetable soup]]\n[[Category:British recipes|Curried lentil and vegetable soup]]\n[[Category:Garlic recipes|Curried lentil and vegetable soup]]\n[[Category:Grain and bean recipes|Curried lentil and vegetable soup]]\n[[Category:Main courses|Curried lentil and vegetable soup]]\n[[Category:Potato recipes|Curried lentil and vegetable soup]]\n[[Category:Soup and stock recipes|Curried lentil and vegetable soup]]\n[[Category:Spicy recipes|Curried lentil and vegetable soup]]\n[[Category:Starters|Curried lentil and vegetable soup]]\n[[Category:Vegetable recipes|Curried lentil and vegetable soup]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes|Curried lentil and vegetable soup]]\n[[Category:Boiled or simmered]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#vegetables #onions #brusselssprouts #soup #curryspicemix #lentils #garlic #spice #diced #potatoes #swede </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
