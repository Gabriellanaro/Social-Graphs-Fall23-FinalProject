Make sure that there is plenty of space between each one.  Depending on the size of your pan, you should be able to do at least 3 at a time.\n| Flip them over when they start to [[Bubble|bubble]] and the underneath is golden [[Brown|brown]].\n| When the other side is cooked, place them in a clean [[Tea towel|tea towel]] whilst you do the rest.\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe hot with [[Butter|butter]] or [[Clotted cream|clotted cream]] and [[Jam|jam]] or [[Honey|honey]].  Alternatively, if you are feeling cheffy, you could turn these into a pudding by making a stack of three or four scones with various fillings such as [[Fruit|fruit]], chopped [[Nuts|nuts]] and thick [[Cream|cream]]. \n===Variations===\nIt is possible to make savoury versions.  Leave out the [[Sugar|sugar]] (but keep the [[Golden syrup|golden syrup]]!) and add flavourings of your choice.  I have made versions with [[Garlic|garlic]], [[Chilli|chilli]] and [[Herbs|herbs]].\n===Chef's notes===\nIf you do not wish to eat them straight away, keep them in an airtight container such as a [[Lock&Lock boxes|Lock&Lock box]] and reheat in a warm [[Oven|oven]] as required.\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes|Drop scones]]\n[[Category:Bread and baking|Drop scones]]\n[[Category:British recipes|Drop scones]]\n[[Category:Historic recipes|Drop scones]]\n[[Category:Sweets and desserts|Drop scones]][[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#dropscones #goldensyrup #cream #eggs #chilli #fruit #butter #clottedcream #bubble #herbs #unusualrecipes </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
