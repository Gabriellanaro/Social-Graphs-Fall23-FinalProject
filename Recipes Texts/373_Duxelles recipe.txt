It is a basic preparation used in stuffings and [[sauces]] (notably, [[beef Wellington]]), or as a garnish. Duxelles can also be filled into a pocket of raw pastry and baked as a savoury tart (similar to a hand-held pie).\n\n'''Duxelles''' is made with any cultivated or wild mushroom, depending on the recipe. Duxelles made with wild [[porcini mushrooms]] will be much stronger flavoured than that made with [[white mushrooms]] or [[brown mushrooms]]. Fresh mushrooms are usually used, however reconstituted dried varieties are used as well. If you want a stronger flavour, use a mixture of both.\n\n'''Duxelles''' is a useful way to freeze and store [[mushrooms]] that would not normally be reusable after [[freezing]].\n\nDuxelles is said to have been created by the 17th-century French chef Fran\u00e7ois Pierre La Varenne (1615\u20131678) and to have been named after his employer, Nicolas Chalon du Bl\u00e9, marquis d'Uxelles, mar\u00e9chal de France.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 250 g [[Mushrooms|mushrooms]] chopped very finely.
