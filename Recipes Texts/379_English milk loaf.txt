The ingredients are listed in the order in which you should add them to a Panasonic [[breadmaker]] and set to French [[bread]] dough setting. For the [[Panasonic SD-ZB2502 automatic breadmaker]] use menu option 21, French dough. For other makes, refer to your manufacturer's instructions and set to the longest dough programme, then continue from stage 4.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 7g easy [[Bake|bake]] [[Yeast|yeast]]\n| 450g strong [[Plain flour|plain flour]]\n| 1 tablespoon full-[[Fat|fat]] dried [[Milk powder|milk powder]]\n| 2 tablespoons [[Sunflower oil|sunflower oil]]\n\n| &frac12; teaspoon [[Salt|salt]]\n| 270ml warm [[Milk|milk]]\n}}\n\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Mix the [[Flour|flour]], [[Salt|salt]], [[Yeast|yeast]] and [[Milk powder|milk powder]] in a bowl.\n| Add the [[Milk|milk]] and [[Oil|oil]] and mix to a soft [[Dough|dough]], adding a little more [[Flour|flour]] if it is too wet.\n| Knead for 10 minutes until it becomes smooth, springy and silky.\n| Lightly, but thoroughly grease the [[Milk|milk]] loaf pan with an [[Oil|oil]] such as [[Groundnut|groundnut]] which is low in monounsaturates.\n| Shape the [[Dough|dough]] into a cylinder the same length of the tin.\n| Place the [[Dough|dough]] into the bottom of the tin, engage the tabs and clip the tin together.\n| Set the tin aside in a [[warm place]] to allow the [[Bread|bread]] to rise - watch the [[Dough|dough]] through the small vision hole at the top.\n| Heat the [[Oven|oven]] to 200\u00b0 C (400\u00b0 F - gas 6).\n| As soon as the [[Dough|dough]] can be seen rising towards the hole, [[Bake|bake]] for 30 minutes ([[Fan-assisted oven|fan-assisted oven]]) or 35 minutes ([[Conventional oven|conventional oven]]).\n| Allow the tin to cool for 2-3 minutes before unclipping and turn out onto a [[Cooling rack|cooling rack]].\n}}\n===Chef's notes===\nYou can make this with fresh [[yeast]] if you wish, in which case allow 15g and dissolve it in the milk before use.  This method is not suitable for [[breadmakers]].  For this recipe I used French bread flour from [[Wessexmill.co.uk|Wessex Mills]] but you can play around with various flours.\n==See also==\n* [[Milk loaf recipe]]\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Bread and baking]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes]]\n[[Category:Breadmaker recipes]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#dough #englishmilkloaf #yeast #bake #flour #bread #milkpowder #groundnut #conventionaloven #breadmakers #fat </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
