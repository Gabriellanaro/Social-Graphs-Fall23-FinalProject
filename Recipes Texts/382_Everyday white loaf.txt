Don't worry about the dough sticking to your hands as it will become less moist as you work it.\n| Shape into a ball, place in an oiled bowl and cover with [[Clingfilm|clingfilm]].\n| Leave until the [[Dough|dough]] has almost doubled in size (about an hour).\n| Gently [[Knock back|knock back]] with your finger tips and repeat steps 7 and 8, but the [[Proving|proving]] should only take about 45 minutes.\n| Gently [[Knock back|knock back]] again, face downards into a rectangle, one side being the same length as the tin.\n| Roll the [[Dough|dough]] towards you as tightly as you can.\n| Flatten and stretch the ends and tuck them underneath so that they meet up in the middle.\n| Place into a 900g / 2lb loaf tin, cover with [[Clingfilm|clingfilm]] and prove until the [[Dough|dough]] reaches the top of the tin.\n| Make some diagonal slashes across the top or one long one across the lenghth and [[Bake|bake]] at 220\u00b0 C (425\u00b0 F - gas 7), [fan [[Oven|oven]] 200\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour] for 30-35 minutes until golden.\n| Cool completely on a wire rack.\n}}\n===Variations===\nThe first 4 stages can be done in a food [[Mixer|mixer]].  \n\nStages 1-9 can be done in a [[Breadmaker|breadmaker]] on the longest [[Dough|dough]] setting. [[Panasonic SD253 breadmaker]], this is French dough, for the [[Panasonic SD-ZB2502 automatic breadmaker]], use menu option 21, French dough.\n===Chef's notes===\nThe amount of water you need can depend on the heat and humidity of your kitchen.  It can also depend on the [[Flour|flour]] you are using.  I used very strong Canadian [[Bread|bread]] [[Flour|flour]], which like [[Wholemeal|wholemeal]], needs much more water than ordinary bread flour.  \n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:British recipes|White]]\n[[Category:Bread and baking|White]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes|White]]\n[[Category:Breadmaker recipes|White]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#flour #dough #everydaywhiteloaf #yeast #mixer #breadmaker #clingfilm #knockback #thermomix #crumble #panasonicsd253breadmaker </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
