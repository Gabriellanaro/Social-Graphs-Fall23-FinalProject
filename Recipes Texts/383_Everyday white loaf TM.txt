There is also a recipe for making this using the [[Everyday white loaf|conventional method]].\n\n{{RecipeIngredientsTM\n| 15g fresh [[Yeast|yeast]]\n| 300g (approx) sparkling water, at room temperature (see Chef's notes below)\n| 500g [[Strong white bread flour|strong white bread flour]]\n| &frac34; teaspoon [[Salt|salt]]\n| 15g [[Olive oil|olive oil]]\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Add the [[Yeast|yeast]] and water to the TM bowl.\n| Mix for '''2 minutes / Temp. 37\u00b0 / Speed 1'''.\n| Add the remaining ingredients in the order given above.\n| '''3 minutes / Knead'''\n| Leave in the TM bowl until the dough has rested and is touching the lid.\n| '''12 seconds / Knead'''\n| Tip the TM bowl upside down on a lightly floured surface .  \n| Loosen the blades by undoing the blade unit at the base.  The weight of the blades will help the dough to drop out of the bowl onto the surface.  \n| Pull any remaining bits of dough off the blades and out of the bowl.\n| Shape into a ball, place in an oiled bowl and cover with [[Clingfilm|clingfilm]].\n| Leave until the [[Dough|dough]] has almost doubled in size (about an hour).\n| Gently [[Knock back|knock back]], face downards into a rectangle, one side being the same length as the tin.\n| Roll the [[Dough|dough]] towards you as tightly as you can.\n| Flatten and stretch the ends and tuck them underneath so that they meet up in the middle.\n| Place into a 900g / 2lb loaf tin, cover with [[Clingfilm|clingfilm]] and prove until the [[Dough|dough]] reaches the top of the tin.\n| Make some diagonal slashes across the top or one long one across the lenghth and [[Bake|bake]] at 220\u00b0 C (425\u00b0 F - gas 7), [fan [[Oven|oven]] 200\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour] for 30-35 minutes until golden.\n| Cool completely on a wire rack.\n}}\n===Chef's notes===\nThe amount of water you need can depend on the heat and humidity of your kitchen.  It can also depend on the [[Flour|flour]] you are using.  I used very strong Canadian [[Bread|bread]] [[Flour|flour]], which like [[Wholemeal|wholemeal]], needs much more water than ordinary bread flour.  \n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes|White]]\n[[Category:British recipes|White]]\n[[Category:Bread and baking|White]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes|White]]\n[[Category:Thermomix recipes|White]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#dough #clingfilm #flour #yeast #bread #thermomix #knockback #wholemeal #everydaywhiteloaf #thermomixrecipeswhite #oliveoil </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
