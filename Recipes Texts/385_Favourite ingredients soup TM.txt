This recipe is designed to be made in a [[Thermomix]].\n\n{{RecipeIngredientsTM\n| 380g [[Cauliflower|cauliflower]], broken into florets\n| 1 bulb [[Garlic|garlic]], peeled\n| 5 small [[Chillies|chillies]], de-stalked, with [[Seeds|seeds]] left in\n| 40g [[Olive oil|olive oil]]\n| 150g strong, hard [[Cheese|cheese]], cut into chunks\n| 300g-400g [[Milk|milk]]\n| Up to 2 teaspoons [[Vegetable|vegetable]] [[Bouillon|bouillon]] powder\n| Seasoning, if necessary\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Add 500g cold water into the TM jug and place the [[Steaming|steaming]] basket containing the [[Cauliflower|cauliflower]], inside.\n| [[Steam]] for '''30 minutes / 100\u00b0 / Speed 1'''.\n| Remove from TM and reserve.\n| Add the [[Garlic|garlic]], [[Chillies|chillies]] and [[Oil|oil]] to the jug  and saut\u00e9 '''10 minutes / Temp. Varoma / Speed 1'''.\n| Add the reserved [[Cauliflower|cauliflower]] and the [[Cheese|cheese]] and mix '''10 seconds / Speed 5''' to chop the cheese.\n| Add the [[Milk|milk]] and [[Bouillon|bouillon]] powder and cook for '''6 minutes / 90\u00b0 / Speed 4'''.\n| Check seasoning and serve immediately.\n}}\n===Variations===\nSubstitute the [[Cauliflower|cauliflower]] with [[Broccoli|broccoli]].\n===Chef's notes===\nAdjust the quantities of [[Chillies|chillies]] and [[Garlic|garlic]] to your own taste.  I like strong flavours so some people may find the above quantities excessive.  It also depends on the type of [[Chilli|chilli]] as to its heat.  I used 'Superchilli' which is slightly on the spiteful side.\n\nThis recipe is ideal for using up any odd bits of [[Cheese|cheese]] in your [[Fridge|fridge]] and I added a mixture of [[Meldon cheese|Meldon]] (Devon) and [[Lake District Cheddar cheese|Lake District Mature]] (Cumbria).  [[Parmesan]], [[Beaufort]] or a vintage [[Cheddar]] would be ideal.\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Soup and stock recipes]]\n[[Category:Spicy recipes]]\n[[Category:Starters]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes]]\n[[Category:Garlic recipes]]\n[[Category:Thermomix recipes]]\n\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#cauliflower #chillies #cheese #garlic #bouillon #chilli #beaufort #thermomixrecipes #soup #fridge #oliveoil </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
