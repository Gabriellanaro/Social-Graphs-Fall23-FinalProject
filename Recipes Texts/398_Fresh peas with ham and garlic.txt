This simple recipe combines all three as a great [[Side dish|side dish]], add a little [[Pasta|pasta]] and you have a superb supper.\n\nIt is ideally made using fresh [[Peas|peas]] but is equally good with [[Frozen|frozen]] baby peas.  I would not use minted peas for this, though that's a personal preference.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| A dash of [[Olive oil|olive oil]]\n| 2 Cloves of [[Garlic|garlic]], peeled and finely sliced\n| 175 g (6 oz) fresh or [[Frozen peas|frozen peas]]\n| 4 slices or [[Parma ham|parma ham]], [[Home smoked bacon|Home smoked bacon]] or good quality dry-[[Cured|cured]] [[Bacon|bacon]]\n| A grind of [[Black pepper|black pepper]]\n\n}}\n\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n* If using [[Frozen peas|frozen peas]] or large fresh [[Peas|peas]], cook as you would do normally, either [[Microwave|microwave]] or [[Boil|boil]] for a few minutes.
