Make the cuts fairly deep because you want the [[Marinade|marinade]] to really penetrate.\n| Place in a shallow bowl\n}}\n'''[[Marinade]]'''\n{{RecipeMethod\n| First [[Microwave|microwave]] the whole [[Lemon|lemon]] for about 15 seconds. This will enable you to extract the maximum amount of [[Juice|juice]]\n| Cut the [[Lemon|lemon]] in half and squeeze the [[Juice|juice]] out into a small mixing bowl removing any pips\n| Add the [[Oil|oil]] and the Crushed [[Garlic|garlic]] and season generously\n| Mix well and pour over the [[Chicken|chicken]] breasts\n| Cover with [[Clingfilm|clingfilm]] and place in the [[Fridge|fridge]]\n| After half an hour turn the [[Chicken|chicken]] over in the [[Marinade|marinade]], re-cover and put back in the [[Fridge|fridge]].\n| Turn [[Chicken|chicken]] over after half an hour (the chicken needs at least 1 hour of [[Marinating|marinating]])\n| Heat a smallish [[Frying pan|frying pan]] over a medium heat and when hot put the [[Chicken|chicken]] in the pan cut-side-up together with half of the [[Marinade|marinade]]\n| Cook for 10 minutes [[Basting|basting]] regularly with the [[Marinade|marinade]]\n| Check the underside of the [[Chicken|chicken]] after about 10 minutes. If nicely [[Brown|brown]], turn it over and put in the rest of the [[Marinade|marinade]].\n| Give this side 10 minutes, again [[Basting|basting]] regularly.\n| The [[Lemon juice|lemon juice]] will evaporate leaving a nice [[Brown|brown]] sticky residue on the [[Meat|meat]]. The [[Oil|oil]] will separate.\n| Give the [[Meat|meat]] a little cut in the middle and check that it's not pink. \n| Stir in 3 tablespoons of [[oven dried tomatoes]] and a big handful of chopped [[basil]] leaves.\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe immediately with [[Croquette potatoes|croquette potatoes]] and [[Peas|peas]] with the juices and [[Oil|oil]] from the pan poured over\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Garlic recipes]]\n[[Category:Poultry recipes]]\n[[Category:Student recipes]]\n[[Category:Pan fried]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#chicken #marinade #garlicchickenwithtomatoandbasil #lemon #juice #basting #fridge #microwave #marinating #clingfilm #peas </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
