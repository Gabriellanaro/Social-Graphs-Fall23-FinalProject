The timings are also a bit vague because it's a case of doing things when the [[Starter|starter]] and [[Dough|dough]] look 'ready'. \n\nIt uses a [[Rye sourdough starter|rye sourdough starter]] and strong white Canadian [[Bread|bread]] [[Flour|flour]] and has a hydration rate of about 76%.  As this is a wet [[Dough|dough]], you will need a [[Mixer|mixer]] of some kind\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| 50 g [[Garlic|garlic]], peeled weight\n| 500 g bottled or chlorine free water \n| 170 g 100% organic [[Rye|rye]] [[Starter|starter]]\n| 65 g strong white Canadian [[Bread|bread]] [[Flour|flour]]\n| 65 g tepid [[Garlic|garlic]] water from the above\n| 400 g strong white Canadian [[Bread|bread]] [[Flour|flour]]\n| 250 g tepid [[Garlic|garlic]] water from above\n| 10 g [[Salt|salt]]\n| A further 20g [[Garlic|garlic]] water from above\n}}\n\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n}}\n====Garlic Water====\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Place the [[Garlic|garlic]] and water in a [[Saucepan|saucepan]], bring to the [[Boil|boil]] and boil gently, covered, for 30 minutes.  \n| Strain the [[Garlic|garlic]] and use to [[Chuck|chuck]] into something else.\n| Allow the water to cool until it is about 35\u00b0C.\n}}\n====The Starter====\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Mix the [[Starter|starter]] with the 65g of cooled [[Garlic|garlic]] water and 65g of the [[White flour|white flour]].\n| Place in a bowl, cover with [[Clingfilm|clingfilm]] and make an hole in the top to encourage air-borne bacteria.\n| Leave until it is nice and bubbly.  The length of time this takes, does depend on the temperature at which it's kept - it will be quicker in a warm airing cupboard than at room temperature.  It is up to you how you do this, but obviously don't use the airing cupboard unless you are going to be around to keep and eye on it. I tend to leave mine at room temperature overnight.\n}}\n====Autolysis====\n{{RecipeMethod\n| A couple of hours before you think your [[Starter|starter]] might be nice and bubbly, mix the 400g Canadian [[Flour|flour]] with the 250g [[Garlic|garlic]] water.\n| Leave for about 2 hours.\n| Meanwhile, dissolve the [[Salt|salt]] in 20g hot [[Garlic|garlic]] water\n}}\n====To make the final dough====\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Mix the [[Salt|salt]] mixture with the autolysed [[Flour|flour]].\n| Add the bubbly [[Sourdough starter|sourdough starter]] and mix thoroughly.\n| Now you can either [[Knead|knead]] the [[Dough|dough]] using a dough hook or the knead setting on a [[Thermomix]], or if preferred omit the [[Kneading|kneading]] altogether and use the stretch and fold method, repeating every 30 minutes or so.\n| I tend to give it a bit of a [[Knead|knead]], then place in a oiled bowl, followed by a couple of stretches and folds.\n| Whatever you do, don't knock the [[Dough|dough]] back - just handle it gently.\n| Keep covered.\n| When the [[Dough|dough]] has roughly doubled in size, shape as desired.\n| As it is a wet [[Dough|dough]] you may find that it will need some support eg loaf / cake tin or [[Banneton|banneton]], unless you are skilled at handling wet dough (which I am not).\n| Try not to deflate the [[Dough|dough]] too much whilst shaping.\n| Cover with [[Clingfilm|clingfilm]] and leave to [[Prove|prove]].\n| [[Bake]] at 230\u00b0 C (450\u00b0 F - gas 8), [fan [[Oven|oven]] 210\u00b0 C] for about 40 minutes and allow to cool on a rack.\n}}\n===Variations===\nYou can add some [[Garlic powder|garlic powder]] to the [[Dough|dough]], but don't over do it as the powder caramelises and can make the [[Bread|bread]] look burnt, even though it isn't\n===Chef's notes===\nStarter: I used the [http://forkingfoodie.blogspot.co.uk/2015/03/simple-four-day-sourdough-starter-that.html Forking Foodie's Simple Four Day Sourdough Starter].  Remove it from the [[Fridge|fridge]] at least 12 hours beforehand and feed it.\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes|Bread]]\n[[Category:British recipes|Bread]]\n[[Category:Bread and baking]]\n[[Category:Breakfast recipes|Bread]]\n[[Category:Vegan recipes|Bread]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes|Bread]]\n[[Category:Garlic recipes|Bread]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted|Bread]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#garlic #dough #flour #bread #garlicinfusedsourdoughbread #starter #clingfilm #knead #garlicpowder #thermomix #sourdoughstarter </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
