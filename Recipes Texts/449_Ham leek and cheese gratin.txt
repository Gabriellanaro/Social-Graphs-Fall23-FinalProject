This year I'm making an effort to use them profusely.  I've even deliberately run out of [[Onions|onions]] and just put a sign in the [[Onion|onion]] bowl: \"USE LEEKS!\"\n\nThis recipe is a simple way of combining [[Leeks|leeks]], [[Cheese|cheese]] and [[Ham|ham]] into a gorgeous meal.\n\nThis was very tasty but one problem was the whole leeks.  Although it looks nice, once soft they are very difficult to cut - in future I will slice them thinly and probably not par-boil first. 20 seconds in the [[microwave]] would be enough.\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| 4 medium to small [[Leeks|leeks]], liberally trimmed, peeled and cleaned\n| [[Sea Salt|sea salt]] and [[Freshly ground black pepper|freshly ground black pepper]]\n| Pinch of fresh [[Thyme leaves|thyme leaves]]\n| 150g cooked [[Ham|ham]] - the thinner the better, thick ham does not roll well!\n| 100g [[Cheddar cheese]] for the [[Cheese sauce|cheese sauce]]\n| &#190; pint of [[Milk|milk]] [354 ml]\n| 2 tablespoons [[Butter|butter]]\n| 2 tablespoons [[Plain flour|plain flour]]\n| 4 tablespoons [[Panko|panko]] [[Breadcrumbs|breadcrumbs]]\n| 25g [[Cheddar cheese]] to top\n| 25g crumbled [[Blue cheese|blue cheese]] (optional)\n}}\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n\n* Preheat the [[Oven|oven]] to 180\u00b0 C (350\u00b0 F - gas 4), [fan oven 160\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Leeks and ham sauce added.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Adding the final topping\nImage:Leeks and ham ready for cheese sauce.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Leeks rolled in ham, ready for the sauce\n</gallery>\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| Ensure the [[Leeks|leeks]] are properly cleaned\n| I've used small gratin dishes so had to halve them but you can leave them whole\n| [[Boil]] the [[Leeks|leeks]] in lightly [[Salted|salted]] water for about 8 minutes or until softened - they can also be microwaved, see below.\n| Drain well.\n| Meanwhile, to make the [[Cheese sauce|cheese sauce]], melt the [[Butter|butter]] with a pinch of [[Black pepper|black pepper]] and stir in the [[Flour|flour]] once melted.\n| Whisk the [[Milk|milk]] in and bring to a [[Simmer|simmer]], don't [[Boil|boil]]. Once [[Simmering|simmering]], whisk well, add 100 g of the [[Cheddar]] and once melted, remove from the heat.\n| Roll the [[Leeks|leeks]] in the cooked [[Ham|ham]] and lay in a lightly oiled gratin dish or shallow [[Casserole|casserole]].\n| Pour the [[Cheese sauce|cheese sauce]] over the [[Leeks|leeks]].\n| If you have the time, chilling the mixture in the gratin dishes (as pictured), solidifies the cheese sauce making it easier to add the topping, which has a tendency to sink into the hot sauce.\n| Mix the [[Breadcrumbs|breadcrumbs]] and any [[Cheese|cheese]] you are using for the topping in a bowl and [[Crumble|crumble]] well, maybe add a pinch of [[Black pepper|black pepper]].\n| Pour this mixture over the top and [[Bake|bake]] uncovered at the top of the [[Oven|oven]] at 180\u00b0 C\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nA few [[Tomatoes|tomatoes]] is all this dish needs to finish it off.\n===Variations===\nYou could include a little [[Pasta|pasta]] to stretch this dish even further.\n===Chef's notes===\nThe [[Leeks|leeks]] can be softened in the [[Microwave|microwave]], the advantage of this over [[Boiling|boiling]] is that they keep their color.\n\nLay them on a plate and [[Microwave|microwave]] on full power for 2 minutes.full power.\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Italian recipes]]\n[[Category:Historic recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Cheese recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegetable recipes]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n[[Category:Boiled or simmered]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#leeks #cheesesauce #microwave #ham #boil #cheddarcheese #hamleekandcheesegratin #butter #cheese #breadcrumbs #blackpepper </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
