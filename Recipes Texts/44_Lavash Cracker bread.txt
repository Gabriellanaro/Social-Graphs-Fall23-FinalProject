It is the most widespread type of bread in Iran, Pakistan, Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia. Toasted [[sesame seeds]] and/or [[poppy seeds]] are sometimes sprinkled on it before baking, though this is very uncommon in Armenia. While some wrap breads sold in the United States label themselves as lavash, actual lavash is significantly thinner than those products.\n\nWhile flexible like a [[tortilla]] when fresh, lavash dries out quickly and becomes brittle and hard. The soft form tastes better and is easier to use when making wrap sandwiches; however, the dry form can be used for long-term storage and is used instead of [[leavened]] bread in Eucharist traditions by the Armenian Apostolic Church. Dry, leftover lavash is used in Iran to make quick meals after being rehydrated with water, [[butter]] and [[cheese]]. Lavash bread is also used with [[kebabs]]. In Turkey, a meat kebab rolled in a lavash bread takes the name \"d\u00fcr\u00fcm\", possibly qualified by the kebab's first name. For example, an Adana Kebab rolled in a lavash bread takes the name of \"Adana d\u00fcr\u00fcm\", the most popular d\u00fcr\u00fcm type in Turkey.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 190 g [[Bread|bread]] [[Flour|flour]]                  \n| &frac12; teaspoon [[Salt|salt]]                           \n| &frac12; teaspoon easy [[Bake|bake]] [[Yeast|yeast]]                  \n| 1 tablespoon [[Honey|honey]]                             \n| 1 tablespoon [[Oil|oil]], plus extra for glazing                    \n| 85 ml water, at room temperature \n| [[Seeds]] and/or [[Herbs|herbs]] and/or [[Spices|spices]] (optional)\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Mix all of the ingredients together, except for the [[Seeds|seeds]] etc.\n| Knead for 10 minutes\n| Leave to rise in a [[warm place]] for about 90 minutes until doubled in size.     \n| Using a [[Rolling pin|rolling pin]], flatten into a paper-thin sheet. (The whole batch of [[Dough|dough]] should measure approximately 30 x 38 cm.) \n| Preheat the [[Oven|oven]] to 180\u00b0 C (350\u00b0 F - gas 4)\n| Optional - glaze the [[Dough|dough]] with oil and sprinkle lightly with [[Seeds|seeds]], [[Herbs|herbs]] or [[Spices|spices]] of your choice.          \n| [[Bake]] for 15 to 20 minutes evenly [[Browned|browned]] and allow to cool for about 10 minutes.\n}}\n===Variations===\nIf you wish, you can cut the [[Dough|dough]] into strips and sprinkle a different topping on each, as illustrated.  Suggested topping are [[Sesame seeds|sesame seeds]], [[Poppy seeds|poppy seeds]], [[Nigella|nigella]] [[Seeds|seeds]], [[Basil|basil]], [[Dill|dill]], [[Mint|mint]], [[Aleppo pepper]] etc.  It also comes in rounds.\n===Chef's notes===\nThe mixing stage can be carried out using a [[breadmaker]]. The pizza dough setting on the Panasonic range of breadmakers is perfect for this. \nHaving just made these delicious breads, I imagine they would make a great base for a variation of a [[pizza]].\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes|Lavash (cracker bread)]]\n[[Category:Accompaniments|Lavash (cracker bread)]]\n[[Category:Armenian recipes|Lavash (cracker bread)]]\n[[Category:Bread and baking|Lavash (cracker bread)]]\n[[Category:Prepared foods|Lavash (cracker bread)]]\n[[Category:Ingredients|Lavash (cracker bread)]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#seeds #dough #spices #leavened #herbs #flour #bake #sesameseeds #poppyseeds #aleppopepper #flatbread </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
