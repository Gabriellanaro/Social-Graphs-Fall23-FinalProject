This time [[Taste Sensation harissa seasoning]].\n\nI've used a [[Spicy pork spare ribs|similar recipe]] as the basis for this, but used only the [[harissa seasoning]], rather than a selection of [[Spices|spices]] as I wanted to really taste their seasoning in this.\n\nOur butcher has been very generous with the [[Ribs|ribs]] too. More of a loin cut than ribs.  We've used about 900g of the ribs for two greedy people as a main.\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| 900g [[Pork spare ribs|pork spare ribs]] - separated\n| 3 [[Fat|fat]] [[Cloves of garlic|cloves of garlic]] - or lots of miserable little ones\n| 250 ml [[Red wine|red wine]] -  we [[Freeze|freeze]] any leftover red [[Wine|wine]], great for recipes like this.\n| 2 tablespoons [[Sherry vinegar|sherry vinegar]]\n| 2 tablespoons [[Tomato puree|tomato puree]]\n| 1 tablespoon [[Honey|honey]]\n| 2 [[Scant|scant]] tablespoons of [[Taste Sensation harissa seasoning]]\n}}\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n\n* Preheat your [[Oven|oven]] to 140\u00b0 C (350\u00b0 F - gas 4), [fan oven 160\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Taste Sensation harissa marinade.jpg|The marinade, mixed shaking the Lock and Lock box!\nImage:Taste Sensation harissa ribs ingredients.jpg|The basic ingredients - remember to cut up the ribs!\n</gallery>\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| Separate the [[Ribs|ribs]] (or [[Meat|meat]]) into manageable chunks, or get your butcher to do this.\n| Add everything to a [[Lock & Lock box]], close the lid and shake like crazy for a minute or so.\n| Leave to [[Marinade|marinade]] for 24 hours in a cool place\n| When ready to cook, shake up again and then tip everything out onto a deep [[Baking tray|baking tray]], cover with a tray or tin-foil and [[Roast|roast]] at the top of the [[Oven|oven]] for about 4 hours stirring up occasionally.\n| About 15 minutes before you are ready to serve, turn the heat up to 220\u00b0, uncover and cook until all the juices have turned dark and sticky and coated the ribs.\n| Serve\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nThis went very nicely with [[peas]], [[sweetcorn]], [[carrots]] and a simple, non-spicy gravy. \n===Recipe source===\n\n* Inspired by [[Taste Sensation Seasonings]]!\n\n===Chefs notes===\nBecause Christmas dinner got in the way of devouring these, they actually spent 3 days marinating in the fridge. And were no better or worse for that, so don't be concerned about how long you marinade them for, providing it is in a cool place.\n\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Spicy recipes]]\n[[Category:Starters]]\n[[Category:Tapas, mezze and antipasti]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:Pork recipes]]\n[[Category:Cooking with wine]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n[[Category:Taste Sensation recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#ribs #harissaporkspareribs #scant #freeze #wine #spices #fat #tomatopuree #harissaseasoning #sweetcorn #roast </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
