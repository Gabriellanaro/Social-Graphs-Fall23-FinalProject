It was fabulous, easy to make and  even easier to modify to suit your particular tastes.\n\nThe squash was the colourful [[winter squash]] (dumpling squash) and as this was a side dish for two people, half the squash was enough for both of us. The  tangerines were tiny, packed full of flavour with thin skins and very little pith.  The carrots had been picked that day, complete with leaves.\n\nChoose whatever [[Herbs|herbs]] you enjoy and just sprinkle them over the [[Vegetables|vegetables]] before [[Roasting|roasting]].\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| Half a small colourful [[Winter squash|winter squash]] (dumpling squash)\n| 3 [[Carrots|carrots]]\n| 3 [[Tangerines|tangerines]]\n| 1 [[Scant|scant]] teaspoons of [[Dill|dill]] [[Seeds|seeds]]\n| 1 [[Scant|scant]] teaspoon of [[Caraway seeds|caraway seeds]]\n| 10 [[Szechuan peppercorns]], crushed in a [[Pestle and mortar|pestle and mortar]]\n| Pinch of [[Sea Salt|sea salt]]\n| 1 tsb [[Olive oil|olive oil]]\n}}\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n\n* Preheat your [[Oven|oven]] to 220\u00b0 C (425\u00b0 F - gas 7), [fan oven 200\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]\n\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| [[Scoop]] the [[Seeds|seeds]] from the [[Squash|squash]] and peel it and cut into small slices.\n| Peel or scrape the [[Carrots|carrots]], cut into halves or quarters lengthwise and then into pieces so they are the same size as the [[Squash|squash]] pieces.\n| Remove the peel from the [[Tangerines|tangerines]] and separate the segments and leave un-peeled; we're going to use them whole.\n| Tip everything into a [[Roasting tray|roasting tray]] and spay or [[Brush|brush]] them with about a tablespoon of [[Olive oil|olive oil]].\n| Sprinkle the [[Seeds|seeds]] and seasonings over the top, shake the tray well and [[Roast|roast]] for about 30 minutes or until the [[Carrots|carrots]] are done to your liking - everything else should be done nicely if the carrots are cooked as you like them.\n}}\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Vegetables and tangerines roasted.jpg|Roasted and ready to serve after 30 minutes\nImage:Carrot squash tangerines and herbs, ready to roast.jpg|Oil, sprinkled with herbs and ready to roast\nImage:Preparing summer squash.jpg|Half of this type of squash, perfect!\n</gallery>\n===Variations===\nUse any [[Herbs|herbs]] or [[Spices|spices]] that you like - [[Chilli flakes|chilli flakes]] and [[Fennel|fennel]] would be nice with this too.\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Snacks and light bites]]\n[[Category:Tapas, mezze and antipasti]]\n[[Category:Vegan recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegetable recipes]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:12032020'>#seeds #carrots #oliveoil #dumplingsquash #herbycarrotsquashandorangebake #scant #herbs #squash #wintersquash #tangerines #snacksandlightbites</code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
