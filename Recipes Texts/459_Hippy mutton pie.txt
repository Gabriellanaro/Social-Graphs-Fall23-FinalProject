My wife wears a lot of purple and she is a bit hippy-ish, hence the name.   Do not be alarmed however, at the use of [[Hemp seed oil|hemp seed oil]].  Although it comes from the [[Seeds|seeds]] of ''Cannabis sativa'', the [[Oil|oil]] does not contain the psychoactive contents of the plant.  Looks weird, but tastes delicious!\n\n'''For the [[Mutton|mutton]]'''\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| [[Olive oil]]\n| 500g [[Shoulder|shoulder]] of [[Mutton|mutton]], trimmed of [[Fat|fat]] and cut into smallish chunks\n| [[Hemp seed oil]]\n| 150g [[Celery|celery]], hacked rustically\n| 150g [[Carrots|carrots]], peeled and hacked rustically\n| 1 medium [[Green pepper|green pepper]], hacked rustically\n| 1 medium [[Yellow pepper|yellow pepper]], hacked rustically\n| 1 medium [[Onion|onion]], chopped\n| 1 [[Red onion|red onion]], chopped\n| 1 bulb [[Garlic, crushed|garlic, crushed]]\n| 400ml [[Meat stock|meat stock]]\n| 1 tablespoon [[Tomato|tomato]] pur\u00e9e\n| 30ml [[Worcestershire sauce|worcestershire sauce]]\n| Seasoning\n| 3 heaped teaspoons [[Cornflour|cornflour]]\n}}\n'''For the [[Potato|potato]] topping'''\n{{RecipeIngredientsNB\n| 1kg Purple Majesty [[Potatoes|potatoes]]\n| 60ml hot [[Milk|milk]]\n| 40g [[Butter|butter]]\n| 30ml [[Olive oil|olive oil]]\n| 1 [[Egg yolk|egg yolk]]\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Heat a little [[Olive oil|olive oil]] in a saucepan to [[Smoking|smoking]] point.\n| Add the [[Mutton|mutton]] and cook until the juices have evaporated and the [[Meat|meat]] has begun to caramelise.\n| Transfer the [[Mutton|mutton]] into a deep [[Oven|oven]]-proof dish.\n| Using the same pan, heat a little [[Hemp seed oil|hemp seed oil]] and reduce the heat to medium.\n| Add the [[Celery|celery]] and [[Carrots|carrots]] and cook until they are beginning to colour and soften.\n| Stir in the [[Onion|onion]] and [[Peppers|peppers]], adding more [[Hemp seed oil|hemp seed oil]] if necessary, and cook for about until they, too, are soft, stirring from time to time\n| Add the [[Garlic|garlic]] and [[Fry|fry]] for 2-3 minutes - do not allow it to burn.\n| Mix the [[Vegetables|vegetables]] with the [[Mutton|mutton]] and season to taste.\n| Still using the same saucepan, heat the [[Stock|stock]], tomatoe pur\u00e9e and [[Worcestershire sauce]].\n| Put the [[Cornflour|cornflour]] in a mug or jug and add some hot [[Stock|stock]] to it, a little at a time, stirring until you have a thick, smooth paste.\n| Add  a little more [[Stock|stock]] to it, stir, and pour into the saucepan with the rest of the stock.\n| Tip the [[Mutton|mutton]] and [[Vegetable|vegetable]] into the [[Stock|stock]], reduce the heat and [[Simmer|simmer]], partially covered, for 10-15, stirring occasionally.\n| The [[Stock|stock]] should be fairly thick.\n| Pour back into the [[Oven|oven]]-proof dish and allow to cool completely.\n| Meanwhile, [[Boil|boil]] the [[Potatoes|potatoes]] in unsalted water until the are cooked - about 20 minutes.\n| Preheat the [[Oven|oven]] to 140\u00b0 C (257\u00b0 F - gas 1)\n| Drain the [[Potatoes|potatoes]] in a [[Colander|colander]], place the colander on a metal tray and put in the [[Oven|oven]] to dry out for about 15-20 minutes.\n| [[Mash]] or rice the [[Potatoes|potatoes]], gradually incorporating the hot [[Milk|milk]], [[Butter|butter]], [[Oil|oil]] and [[Egg yolk|egg yolk]].\n| Allow to cool competely.\n| Using a palette knife, spread the [[Potato|potato]] mixture over the [[Mutton|mutton]],\n| Run a fork, which has been dipped in [[Milk|milk]], over the top of the [[Potato|potato]] to make a pattern.\n| [[Bake]] at 200\u00b0 C (400\u00b0 F - gas 6) for 10 minutes, reduce the heat to 180\u00b0 C (350\u00b0 F - gas 4) and bake for a further 30 minutes.\n}}\n===Variations===\nOf course, you can use whatever [[Mashing|mashing]] [[Potatoes|potatoes]], [[Vegetables|vegetables]] and [[Oil|oil]] you like.  \nThe [[Garlic|garlic]] quantity may seem large, but it will not be overpowering.  I would have added more, but I couldn't be bothered to peel more than one bulb.\n\nUse [[lamb]] or [[beef]] instead of [[mutton]].\n\nSubstitute some of the [[stock]] with red [[wine]].\n===Chef's notes===\nPurple Majesty [[potatoes]] are available from branches of '''[http://www.sainsburys.co.uk/sol/index.jsp Sainsbury's].'''\n\nHemp seed oil is available in large branches of the main supermarkets or direct from '''[http://www.goodwebsite.co.uk/index.php Good Website]'''\n==See also==\n* [[Shepherds' pie recipes|Other shepherds' pie recipes]]\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:Mutton recipes]]\n[[Category:Pies tarts and flans]]\n[[Category:Potato recipes]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#mutton #potatoes #stock #hempseedoil #oliveoil #potato #hippymuttonpie #carrots #eggyolk #onion #butter </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
