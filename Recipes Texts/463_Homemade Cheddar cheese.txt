See here for [[ideas on how to improvise one]].\n\nIt is vital that you don't exceed any of the stated temperatures or your [[Cheese|cheese]] '''will''' fail.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 7 [[Pints|pints]] full-cream [[Milk|milk]]\n| &frac14; teaspoon freeze dried [[DVI starter]]\n|* ''I used a generic [[Ascott]] starter''.\n| 8 drops [[Rennet|rennet]]\n| 1 tablespoon [[Sea Salt|sea salt]]\n\n}}\n\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n* [[Sterilise]] all equipment\n\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Warm the [[Milk|milk]] to 32\u00b0 C (90\u00b0 F)\n| Mix &frac14; teaspoons of [[freeze dried DVI starter]] with 4 tablespoons of lukewarm water.\n| Whisk into the [[Milk|milk]] and stir really well so it is properly mixed.\n| Cover and leave for 1 hour.\n| Mix 8 drops of [[Rennet|rennet]] with 4 tablespoons lukewarm water and whisk into the [[Milk|milk]]. Stir really well so it is properly mixed.\n| Leave for 2 hours for the [[Milk|milk]] to solidify.\n| [[Cut the curds]] with a long knife into 5 mm (1/4\") cubes.\n| Leave to rest for 20 minutes.\n| In a [[double boiler]], heat the outer water to 39\u00b0 C (102\u00b0 F), using extra heat to keep this temperature stable, and stir the [[Curds|curds]] regularly until they reach 39\u00b0 C (102\u00b0 F).  Stir regularly and don't overheat or the curds will melt together and you'll end up with [[Mozzarella cheese|mozzarella cheese]]!\n| Once the [[Curd|curd]] temperature is stable at 39\u00b0 C (102\u00b0 F), cook the [[Curds|curds]] for another 45 minutes. As before, stabilise by using a little extra heat - you won't need much. Stir regularly to prevent the curds knitting together.  A spring-type whisk (pictured) works well for this.\n| Drain the [[Curds|curds]] in a [[cheesecloth]] lined [[Colander|colander]].\n| Add them back to the [[double boiler]], stir well with a whisk to break up the [[Curds|curds]] and cook for another 45 minutes at 39\u00b0 C (102\u00b0 F).\n| Sprinkle in the [[sea salt]] and mix well.\n| Place the [[Curds|curds]] in a [[cheesecloth]] lined [[cheese mould]] and press with a 9kg (20 lbs) weight for 45 minutes.\n| Take the [[Cheese|cheese]] out of the [[cheese mould]] and turn it round.\n| Press it again with 22 kg (50 lb) for 24 hours.\n| Remove from the [[cheese press]] and dry for 5 days at room temperature.\n| Wrap in a sterilised [[cheesecloth]], seal the [[Cheddar]] with a [[flour]] and water paste and mature for 3 to 24 months\n| Unless you have a cave handy, the [[fridge]] is probably the best place to mature your [[homemade cheese]] although it's really going to be too cold. After discovering the top shelf of my often-opened fridge could be as much as 5\u00b0 C warmer than the bottom, I've decided to mature my cheeses there.  As all fridges differ, check various areas of your fridge with a thermometer to find the area that is around 11\u00b0C [51\u00b0 F], the ideal 'cave' temperature.\n|Ideally hard cheeses should be left to mature for up to 3 months or more and turned regularly; however, if you don't have the patience to wait that long for your home-made cheese you will find the results of a young cheese perfectly acceptable.\n}}\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Cheddar-second-cooking.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Cooking the curds, second stage\nImage:Improvised-double-boiler-fo.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Improvised double boiler\n</gallery>\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes|Cheddar]]\n[[Category:Cheese making|Cheddar]]\n[[Category:Cheese recipes|Cheddar]]\n[[Category:British recipes|Cheddar]]\n[[Category:Snacks and light bites|Cheddar]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes|Cheddar]]\n\n[[Category:Uncooked]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#curds #cheesecloth #cheese #homemadecheddarcheese #cheesemould #doubleboiler #curd #cheddar #flour #dvistarter #cutthecurds </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
