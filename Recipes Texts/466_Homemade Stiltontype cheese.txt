I always forget.\n\nA month or so on, and I can report this was an absolute success. Very creamy, almost runny, every bite seems to have a slightly different flavour. Totally recommended!\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 6 [[Litres|litres]] full cream milk (I used [[Pasteurised|pasteurised]], shop-bought milk)\n| A little [[DVI starter]] (see picture)\n| Freeze dried [[Penicillium Roquefortii]] (see picture)\n| 2 ml [[Rennet|rennet]]\n| Table salt (28g per 1200g of curd)\n}}\n\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n'''Prepare the [[Penicillium Roqueforti]] mould culture'''\n# [[Boil]] a little water and allow to go cold.\n# Pour 150 ml of the cold, [[Sterilised|sterilised]] water into a lidded container.\n# Whisk up a small amount of [[freeze dried Penicillium Roquefortii]] (see picture) into the cold, [[Boiled|boiled]] water so the powder is held in suspension.\n# Cover and [[Refrigerate|refrigerate]] for up to 24 hours - use within 3 days\n# [[Sterilise]] all equipment\n===Method===\n'''Setting the [[Curds|curds]]'''\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Using a [[Double boiler|double boiler]] pre-warmed to 29\u00b0C, add the cold [[Pasteurised|pasteurised]] [[Milk|milk]] and slowly bring the milk temperature to 29\u00b0C\n| Whisk  the [[DVI starter]] into a little of the warm [[Milk|milk]] and re-introduce the milk suspension into the boiler.\n| Pour the [[Penicillium Roquefortii mould culture]] into the warm [[Milk|milk]].  Whisk to mix. Cover with a clean [[Tea-towel|tea-towel]] and leave for 30 minutes.\n| Add 2ml of [[Rennet|rennet]] to 1 tablespoon of cold, previously [[Boiled|boiled]] water, mix well and add to the  [[Milk|milk]].\n| Whisk to mix, cover and leave in a warm place (about 22\u00b0C) until the curd sets.\n| Lay a boiled cheesecloth on a [[draining mat]] and then ladle all of the curds on to the cheesecloth.  The picture shows 3/4 of the curds - I had to put the rest into a second tray.\n| Fold to cover the curds and leave to stand in the [[whey]] for 60 minutes.\n| Wind one corner of the cheesecloth around the other three corners to make a Stilton knot (a kind of noose).\n| Hang the bag up to drain off the [[whey]].\n| Every 30 minutes for the next two hours, tighten the bag a little more.\n}}\n'''Salting and packing the curds'''\n{{RecipeMethod\n| After 2 hours, cut the [[curds]] into [[walnut]]-sized cubes.\n| Sprinkle the cubes evenly with table salt at a ratio of 28g per 1200g of curd.\n| Pack the [[curds]] into unlined moulds but don't compress them. (I used a colander as a mould for this batch)\n| Leave the [[curds]] for 5 days, turning daily to ensure it can still drain freely.  I stored mine in a the salad container in the fridge with a bowl of water in a vain attempt to maintain humidity.  Ideally a little warmer (cave-like) would be more ideal.\n| After 5 days, the cheese should have shrunk away from the sides of the mould.\n| Use a spatula to rub the surface of the cheese flat so there are no holes on the outside.\n| Cover with [[cling-film]] or rub with vegetable oil to seal the surface and leave to mature in a cool damp place.  Again, if you have a cave, that would be ideal!  Try to maintain a degree of humidity if possible.\n| After 5 days, remove the cling-film and create the airways for the veining to form by piercing the cheese at regular intervals with a sterilised knitting needle or kebab skewer.  (Take a close look at the high-resolution image of [[Stichelton cheese]] to see how the commercial cheese makers do this.)\n}}\nLeave to mature for as long as you can bear! A wooden or wicker plate is good for this as it won't make the cheese sweat. The ideal conditions are 8\u00b0C to 12\u00b0C at 90% humidity.\n\nUnless you have a cave handy, the [[fridge]] is probably the best place to mature your [[homemade cheese]] although it's really going to be too cold. After discovering the top shelf of my often-opened fridge could be as much as 5\u00b0 C warmer than the bottom, I've decided to mature my cheeses there.  As all fridges differ, check various areas of your fridge with a thermometer to find the area that is around 11\u00b0C [51\u00b0 F], the ideal 'cave' temperature. \n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Home-made Stilton-type cheese recipe.jpg|After 1 month, in its fridge 'cave'.

I increased the amount to 6 litres. This produced about 1.2 kg of set curds at the packing stage.\n'''Temperature and humidity are very important'''.\n \nI have been known for a certain degree of impatience, not least when it comes to waiting for cheese to mature!  Well, after a week in wraps and a further week in the fridge at 8\u00b0C, sitting over a bowl of water in the salad crisper, I was most disappointed not to have a neatly veined piece of blue cheese. Pondering this dilemma on the hottest day of the year, I thought maybe a few days in a homemade humidifier, placed in our cool garage, might help things along a little.  The next morning when I scampered out to the garage to check progress, my pure white Stilton had overnight, turned into a huge blue furry football!  A quick check of my [[Minimum-maximum thermometer|minimum-maximum thermometer]] showed that it had got as warm as 22\u00b0C - far too warm, hence all the fur. \nRubbed clean of its blue fur coat, crumbled and re-constituted into a Stilton cylinder, it is back in the fridge and there it will stay for the next 3 months - caveat nibbler. \n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes|Stilton]]\n[[Category:Cheese recipes|Stilton]]\n[[Category:Cheese making|Stilton]]\n[[Category:British recipes|Stilton]]\n\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n[[Category:Snacks and light bites|Stilton]]\n[[Category:Starters|Stilton]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes|Stilton]]\n[[Category:Blue cheeses|Stilton]]\n[[Category:Uncooked]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#curds #homemadestiltontypecheese #whey #dvistarter #penicilliumroqueforti #penicilliumroquefortii #pasteurised #homemadecheese #fridge #stilton #sticheltoncheese </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
