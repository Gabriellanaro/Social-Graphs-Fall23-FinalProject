Ready-made pastry is [[Frozen|frozen]] and if you are in a hurry, it is quicker to make your own than wait for the frozen to [[de-frost]].\n\nMost ready-made [[Pastry|pastry]] will contain manufactured [[Fat|fat]], whereas you can choose your own fat type if you make it yourself.\n\nTraditionally, a mixture of half-[[Lard|lard]] and half-[[Butter|butter]] was considered the ideal mixture and it probably still is.  However, as a vegetarian, I always use 100% [[butter]].\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 250 g [[Plain flour|plain flour]], sifted\n| &frac14; teaspoon [[icing sugar]]\n| 6 g [[Salt|salt]]\n| 125 g cold [[Butter|butter]], cut into small chunks and chilled\n| About 75 ml iced water\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Mix the [[Flour|flour]] with the [[icing sugar]] and [[Salt|salt]] in a bowl and add the chunks of [[Butter|butter]].\n| If making the [[Pastry|pastry]] manually, cut the [[Butter|butter]] into the [[Flour|flour]] with cold scissors, until the mixture is like fine [[Breadcrumbs|breadcrumbs]].\n| To ensure that the [[Butter|butter]] has been sufficiently incorporated, shake the bowl back and forth.  Any large lumps will come to the surface and you can cut them in again.\n| Add the cold water, not all at once, stirring with a fork to mix it in.\n| Keep adding the water until you can form the mixture into a compact and non sticky ball, which will hold together.\n| Wrap in [[cling-film]] and place in the [[Fridge|fridge]] for half-an-hour before use.\n| This can be made in a [[Food processor|food processor]], in which case process the [[Flour|flour]], [[Salt|salt]] and [[Butter|butter]] together, using the pulse setting.  Slowly add the water and the mixture should automatically form itself into a ball when enough water has been added.  Do not over-process though, as it will make the mixture too warm.  A stand [[mixer]], if you have one, would be better than using a [[Food processor|food processor]].\n}}\n===Variations===\nYou can make additions to the [[Pastry|pastry]], eg. [[Spices|spices]], [[Cheese|cheese]] and [[Sugar|sugar]] (for a sweet pastry).  \n\n===Chef's notes===\nOnce the [[Pastry|pastry]] has rested in the [[Fridge|fridge]], roll it out according to your recipe's instructions and add the other ingredients.  However, I always put it back in the fridge at this stage for a further 30 minutes, before I put it into the preheated oven.  I do this even with ready-made [[pastry]].\n==See also==\n[[P\u00e2te bris\u00e9e]]'''\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes|Pastry shortcrust]]\n[[Category:Bread and baking|Pastry shortcrust]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Pies tarts and flans|Pastry shortcrust]]\n[[Category:Uncooked]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#butter #pastry #homemadeshortcrustpastry #flour #icingsugar #foodprocessor #fridge #plainflour #mixer #cheese #fat </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
