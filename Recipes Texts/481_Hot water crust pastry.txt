This can be done by either beating the [[flour]] into the mixture in the pan, or by kneading on a pastry board. Either way, the result is a hot and rather sticky paste that can be used for hand-raising - shaping by hand, sometimes using a dish or bowl as an inner mould. As the crust cools, its shape is largely retained, and it is filled and covered with a crust, ready for [[baking]]. Hand-raised hot water crust pastry does not produce a neat and uniform finish, as there will be sagging during the cooking of the filled pie. This is generally accepted as the mark of a hand-made pie. It is possible, however, to [[bake]] the pastry in a mould, as with other pies.\n\nRaised pies are easier to make whilst the pastry is warm.\n\n'''There is a recipe for [[Melton Mowbray style pork pies|Melton Mowbray style pork pies here]].'''\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 225 g (8 oz) strong [[plain flour]]\n| Pinch of crushed [[sea salt]]\n| 25 ml (25 g) (1 fl oz) [[milk]]\n| 25 ml (25 g) (1 fl oz) water\n| 75 g (3 oz) [[lard]] or [[shortening]]\n| 1 large [[egg yolk]], whisked, for glazing and sealing\n}}\n\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n* Preheat the oven to 180\u00b0 C (350\u00b0 F - Gas 4)\n\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Sift the [[salt]] and [[flour]] into a bowl\n| Mix the water and [[milk]] into a medium-sided pan and heat gently\n| Cut the [[lard]] into small pieces and drop into the [[milk]]/water mix\n| Once the [[lard]] has completely melted, raise the heat and bring to the [[boil]] and then immediately remove from the heat\n| Pour into the [[flour]] and, using a wooden spoon, mix well\n| Dust a chopping board with a little extra [[flour]] and [[Kneading bread|knead]] the [[dough]] for a minute or two\n| Two thirds of the dough for the pies and 1/3 for the lids\n| Divide the larger piece into 6 and roll into balls and, using your hands, mould each ball into a pie shape (an upturned glass is useful for this)\n| ''Fill the pies with your desired filling''\n| Using a pastry [[brush]], paint a little of the [[egg yolk]] around the rim of each pie\n| Divide the remaining third into six pieces, roll into balls and then roll each ball flat to make the pie lids\n| Crimp the lids to the pies with the tines of a fork and glaze the pies with any remaining [[egg yolk]]\n| Make a little slash or hole in the top of each pie to allow [[steam]] to escape and [[bake]] on a tray for about 50 to 55 minutes\n| Allow to cool on a wire rack\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\n\nServe warm or cold\n\n===Chef's notes===\n\nHaving made these, I would suggest that this quantity is better suited to 4 slightly larger pies.  Although unconventional, to prevent them collapsing, I would bake them in [[muffin trays]].\n\n===See also===\n\n* Macaroni pie (Scottish)\n* [[Melton Mowbray style pork pies|Melton Mowbray style pork pie]]\n\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Historic recipes]]\n[[Category:Pork recipes]]\n[[Category:Pies tarts and flans]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#flour #hotwatercrustpastry #eggyolk #lard #pork #boil #bake #miseenplace #dough #plainflour #shortening </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
