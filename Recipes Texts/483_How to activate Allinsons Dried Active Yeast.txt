They tested it and even baked a loaf of bread with it.  it transpires that [[Allinsons Dried Active Yeast]] is unsuitable for breadmakers and needs to be ''activated'' first.  These instructions are verbatim from Allinson - Jane Johnson; Customer Quality Co-ordinator. \n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| 1 teaspoon [[Sugar|sugar]]\n| 150 ml warm water (1 part [[Boiling|boiling]], 2 parts cold)\n| 15 g Allinson's [[Dried active yeast|dried active yeast]]\n}}\n\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| Dissolve the [[Sugar|sugar]] in warm water\n| Sprinkle in the [[Dried active yeast|dried active yeast]] and [[Whisk|whisk]] thoroughly.\n| Leave in a [[Warm place|warm place]] until the surface is covered in froth. This usually takes 15 minutes.\n| [[Whisk]] again and use immediately.\n| Liquid used to activate '''should not''' be used in addition to the amount of liquid in the recipe.\n}}\n===Chef's notes===\nLike me, you were probably not aware that this was necessary as I had been using this yeast in our [[breadmaker]] for years and years.  However, the loaves are much better after following this procedure.\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Bread and baking]]\n[[Category:Breadmaker recipes]]\n[[Category:Uncooked]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:12032020'>#driedactiveyeast #whisk #britishrecipes #allinsonsdriedactiveyeast #breadmakerrecipes #breadandbaking #breadmaker #warmplace #recipes #yeast #allinsondriedactiveyeast</code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
