Halving the stems to ensure they cook quickly seemed a clever idea to me so I thought I would try it as a standalone [[Vegetable|vegetable]] [[Accompaniment|accompaniment]]. I'm pretty sure that Jamie used sliced [[Chilli|chilli]] as well as garlic, but this is to accompany [[Spicy lamb meatball potato and onion hotpot]] which already has a chilli kick so left it out.\n\nThe tiny bunch of [[Purple sprouting broccoli|purple sprouting broccoli]] seemed expensive at \u00a31.50, but as I was prepping it, it was plain it would easily serve 4 people, so not too expensive after all.\n\nIf you are not too keen on really crunchy stems, I would be inclined to [[Blanch|blanch]] the slices [[Broccoli|broccoli]] for a few minutes before pan [[Frying|frying]] it.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| A teaspoon of [[Olive oil|olive oil]]\n| Half a small bunch of tenderstem [[Broccoli|broccoli]] ([[Purple sprouting broccoli|purple sprouting broccoli]])\n| A [[Sprig of rosemary|sprig of rosemary]]\n| 4 [[Cloves of Garlic, peeled and crushed|cloves of garlic, peeled and crushed]]\n| 100 ml [[White wine|white wine]]\n| 5 ml [[Light soy sauce]]\n}}\n\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| Carefully slice tenderstem [[Broccoli|broccoli]] lengthwise along the whole length if each stem\n| Heat a [[Frying pan|frying pan]] or [[Wok|wok]] over a high heat with a teaspoon of [[Olive oil|olive oil]]. just enough to prevent it sticking but not so that it is greasy\n| Strip the leaves from the [[Rosemary|rosemary]] and add them to the pan together with the [[Broccoli|broccoli]]\n| Toss the pan and keep turning the [[Broccoli|broccoli]] for about 5 minutes then reduce the heat to low\n| Add the [[Crushed garlic|crushed garlic]] and stir it or toss the pan so it cooks evenly\n| The moment it starts to take any colour, add the [[White wine|white wine]] and cover\n| Leave covered for 5 minutes or so until most of the [[Wine|wine]] has reduced\n| Add a splash of [[Soy sauce|soy sauce]] and serve immediately\n}}\n===Chef's notes===\nIf you prefer your [[Broccoli|broccoli]] soft and not crunchy, [[Blanch|blanch]] it in [[Boiling|boiling]] water for a few minutes beforehand\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Accompaniments]]\n[[Category:Vegan recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes]]\n[[Category:Garlic recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegetable recipes]]\n[[Category:Cooking with wine]]\n[[Category:Pan fried]]\n[[Category:Boiled or simmered]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#broccoli #purplesproutingbroccoli #blanch #whitewine #oliveoil #crushedgarlic #wine #unusualrecipes #rosemary #accompaniment #vegetable </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
