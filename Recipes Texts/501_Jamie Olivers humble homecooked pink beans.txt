I thought I would try a pink version using [[Kidney beans|kidney beans]] - very nice they are too.\n\nThe [[Potato|potato]] adds some substance to the [[Sauce|sauce]], the [[Tomato|tomato]] helps to break down the [[Beans|beans]] and the [[Garlic|garlic]] and [[Herbs|herbs]] add bags of flavour.\n\nThis would be great as garlicky [[Beans|beans]] on toast or as an addition to any meal.\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| 500g pack of [[Dried|dried]] [[Kidney beans|kidney beans]] - you'll find the KTC [[Beans|beans]] in the Asian section of your supermarket, very reasonably priced too!\n| 8 [[Cloves of garlic|cloves of garlic]], unpeeled\n| A few small [[Tomatoes|tomatoes]]\n| A [[Sprig of rosemary|sprig of rosemary]]\n| A sprig of [[Thyme|thyme]]\n| A handful of [[Bay leaves|bay leaves]]\n| 1 small [[Potato|potato]], peeled and quartered\n| 1 small stick of [[Celery|celery]], I've used [[Frozen|frozen]] celery\n| A large bunch of fresh [[Parsley|parsley]], finely chopped\n| 5 tablespoons [[Olive oil|olive oil]]\n| 2 tablespoons [[Red wine vinegar|red wine vinegar]]\n| [[Salt]] and [[Pepper|pepper]]\n}}\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n\n* Soak the [[Kidney beans|kidney beans]] in lots of fresh water for 24 hours (or more).

Again do not add any [[Salt|salt]] at this stage.\n| Cover, bring to the [[Boil|boil]] and [[Simmer|simmer]] gently for about an hour. Skim and discard any scum that rises to the surface.\n| After an hour, drain the [[Beans|beans]], reserving the [[Liquor|liquor]].\n| Discard the [[Celery|celery]] stick and the [[Herbs|herbs]].\n| In a separate bowl, add the [[Potato|potato]].\n| Squeeze the [[Garlic|garlic]] from the [[Cloves|cloves]] over the [[Potatoes|potatoes]] and discard the skins.\n| Do the same with the [[Tomatoes|tomatoes]], again, discarding the skins.\n| Add a small ladle-full of the cooking [[Liquor|liquor]], a good pinch of [[Salt|salt]] and [[Pepper|pepper]] and using a [[Potato masher|potato masher]], mix into a runny [[Sauce|sauce]].\n| Add this mixture back into the drained [[Beans|beans]] and add the chopped [[Parsley|parsley]], [[Olive oil|olive oil]] and [[Red wine vinegar|red wine vinegar]] and mix really well.\n| Add a little more [[Liquor|liquor]] if needed.\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe on toast, garnished with fresh [[Parsley|parsley]].\n===Recipe source===\n\n* A variation on Jamie Oliver's Humble home-cooked [[Beans|beans]] from \"Jamie at Home\"\n===Variations===\nAny variety of [[Dried beans|dried beans]] will work well, they just won't be pink if they are not [[Kidney beans|kidney beans]]!\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Accompaniments]]\n[[Category:Snacks and light bites]]\n[[Category:Vegan recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes]]\n[[Category:Garlic recipes]]\n[[Category:Grain and bean recipes]]\n[[Category:Potato recipes]]\n[[Category:Boiled or simmered]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#beans #kidneybeans #parsley #potato #garlic #herbs #celery #liquor #sauce #tomatoes #redwinevinegar </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
