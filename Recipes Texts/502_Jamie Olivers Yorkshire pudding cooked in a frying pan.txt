The recipe in the book is served with [[Smoked salmon|smoked salmon]] but I'm just using this recipe as a simple way to make a Yorkshire pudding.\n\nYou need to be sure that your [[Frying pan|frying pan]] is ovenproof.  The quantities are perfect for a 28cm  ovenproof [[Frying|frying]] pan.  The measurements are usually shown on the base of the pan to save measuring it.\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| 2 tablespoons [[Olive oil|olive oil]]\n| 2 large [[Fresh eggs|fresh eggs]]\n| 150 ml [[Semi-skimmed milk|semi-skimmed milk]]\n| 65 g [[Plain flour|plain flour]]\n| Pinch of [[Salt|salt]] (optional)\n| Pinch of [[Freshly ground black pepper|freshly ground black pepper]] (optional)\n| Chopped [[Fresh herbs|fresh herbs]] (optional)\n}}\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n\n* Preheat the [[Oven|oven]] to 200\u00b0 C (400\u00b0 F - gas 6), [fan oven 180\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]\n\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| Put 2 tablespoons of [[Olive oil|olive oil]] into the [[Frying pan|frying pan]] and set over a medium heat. If you've added a pinch of black pepper to the oil, add the batter when the pepper begins to sizzle. Don't let the [[Oil|oil]] smoke\n| If you want to add [[Salt|salt]], [[Pepper|pepper]] and [[Fresh herbs|fresh herbs]], add them to the [[Liquidiser|liquidiser]] now\n| Add the [[Eggs|eggs]], [[Milk|milk]] and [[Flour|flour]] to your [[Liquidiser|liquidiser]] and blitz until perfectly smooth\n| Pour the [[Batter|batter]] into the pan and [[Fry|fry]] for 30 seconds only.  Give the pan a final swirl after the 30 seconds is up to spread the batter to the edges of the pan\n| Pop the pan into the [[Oven|oven]] for about 13 minutes or until cooked to your liking\n| Serve!\n}}\n===Recipe source===\n\n* Idea from Jamie Oliver's 15 minute meals\n\n===Variations===\n[[Yorkshire puddings]] can be served as a dessert; we always used to have them with [[Golden syrup|golden syrup]] as children - give it a try!\n===Chef's notes===\nIn trying to perfect this imperfect recipe, I've made this almost daily, with slight variations. I would normally cook a [[Yorkshire pudding]] for 20 minutes but I guess that would break the 15 minutes rule. Here's my tips for improving this recipe if you have a little more time than Jamie:\n\n* Whisk the batter just long enough to combine, don;t over mix\n* Use only [[plain flour]], not [[self-raising flour]] or [[strong bread flour]]\n* Leave the batter mix to rest at room temperature while the oven heats\n* Add the [[olive oil]] to the pan and leave the pan in the oven while it gets to the correct temperature\n* Don't bother heating the batter mix on the stove top\n* Cook for 18 minutes at the top of the oven\n===See also===\n* [[Perfect Yorkshire puddings]] - ''this is a far better recipe!''\n* [http://www.amazon.co.uk/Jamies-15-Minute-Meals-Jamie-Oliver/dp/071815780X Jamie Oliver's 15 minute meals book on Amazon UK]\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Accompaniments]]\n[[Category:Historic recipes]]\n[[Category:Snacks and light bites]]\n[[Category:Egg recipes]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n[[Category:Pan fried]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#oliveoil #yorkshirepudding #liquidiser #freshherbs #plainflour #yorkshirepuddings #goldensyrup #eggs #frying #flour #miseenplace </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
