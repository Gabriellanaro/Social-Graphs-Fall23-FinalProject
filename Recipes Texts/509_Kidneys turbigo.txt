This is as close to her recipe that I have been able to get to the recipe she used to make.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 12 [[Shallots|shallots]]\n| 50 g (2 oz) [[Butter|butter]]\n| Olive oil for frying\n| 6 lambs [[Kidneys|kidneys]], washed, skinned, cored and cut into small chunks\n| 1 pack of thin chipolata sausages (about 340 g)\n| 150 g fresh [[button mushrooms]], quartered\n| 2 teaspoons [[Plain flour|plain flour]] \n| 1 teaspoon [[Tomato puree|tomato puree]]\n| 1 tablespoons of [[Sherry|sherry]]\n| 1 tablespoon of [[Sherry vinegar|sherry vinegar]]\n| 284 ml (1/2 pint) [[Beef stock|beef stock]]\n| Good splash of [[Louisiana hot pepper sauce]] or [[Tabasco sauce]]\n| 1 [[Bay leaf|bay leaf]]\n| [[Sea Salt|sea salt]] and [[Freshly ground black pepper|freshly ground black pepper]]\n| 2 tablespoons freshly chopped [[Parsley|parsley]]\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| [[Blanch]] the [[Shallots|shallots]] in [[Boiling|boiling]] [[Salted|salted]] water for 2 minutes, drain and peel - it's easier after they have been blanched. Set aside.\n| Heat a splash of [[olive oil]] in a pan and [[saut\u00e9]] the [[Kidneys|kidneys]] and [[sausages]] on a fairly high heat until [[Browned|browned]] all over. Lift out the kidneys and sausages with a slotted spoon and set aside. I prefer to discard the juice and fat at this stage.\n| Give the pan a wipe round, add 50 g of [[butter]] and add the [[Onions|onions]] and [[Mushrooms|mushrooms]]. [[Saut\u00e9]] for 5 minutes, stirring often.\n| Leaving the [[Mushrooms|mushrooms]] and [[Onions|onions]] in the pan, remove it from the heat and stir in the [[Flour|flour]].\n| Deglaze the pan with the [[Sherry|sherry]] and the [[Sherry vinegar|sherry vinegar]], add [[Tomato puree|tomato puree]], [[Stock|stock]] and [[Bay leaf|bay leaf]], 1 tablespoon of the [[parsley]] and season to taste with [[Salt|salt]] and [[Pepper|pepper]]\n| Cut the [[sausages]] in half or smaller pieces if you wish.\n| Return to the heat, bring to the [[Boil|boil]] and return the [[Kidneys|kidneys]] and [[Sausages|sausages]], reduce the heat, cover and [[Simmer|simmer]] for 40 minutes.\n| Discard the bay leaf and serve immediately, sprinkled with the remaining parsley.\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nThe classic accompaniment for this dish is fried [[croutons]], but I prefer it with [[Peas|peas]] and [[Mashed potatoes|mashed potatoes]].  Plain [[Tortilla chips|tortilla chips]] would be a nice [[Side dish|side dish]] for this.\n===Variations===\nA few rashers of [[home smoked bacon]] added with the sausages would go well with this. \n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Historic recipes]]\n[[Category:Lamb recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Offal recipes]]\n[[Category:Spicy recipes]]\n[[Category:Stews and casseroles]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Stewed, braised or pot roasted]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#kidneysturbigo #kidneys #sausages #butter #sherry #onions #shallots #sherryvinegar #mushrooms #tomatopuree #bayleaf </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
