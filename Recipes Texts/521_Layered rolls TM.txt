I have started by making an overnight sponge, to encourage [[Yeast|yeast]] activity, but you can omit that stage if you like and mix in all the ingredients at the same time.\n\nSee 'Variations' below for instructions on partially making these rolls in a [[Breadmaker|breadmaker]], food [[Mixer|mixer]] and [[Thermomix]].\n\n{{RecipeIngredientsTM\n| 10g fresh [[Yeast|yeast]]\n| 350g [[Sparkling mineral water|sparkling mineral water]]\n| 500g strong [[Bread|bread]] [[Flour|flour]] - you may need to use more water if using very strong bread [[Flour|flour]]\n| 10g [[Salt|salt]]\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| The night before you want to [[Bake|bake]] the [[Bread|bread]], dissolve the [[Yeast|yeast]] in the water,\n| [[Sieve]] 250g [[Flour|flour]] into a large bowl and stir in the water and dissolved [[Yeast|yeast]].  Do NOT add the [[Salt|salt]] at this stage as its will interfere with yeast activity.\n| Mix thoroughly.\n| Cover with [[Clingfilm|clingfilm]] and leave at room temperature overnight.\n| If it becomes very active, [[Refrigerate|refrigerate]] and bring to room temperature in the morning.\n| The next day, [[Sieve|sieve]] the remaining 250g [[Flour|flour]] with the [[Salt|salt]] and add to the bowl.\n| Mix thoroughly and leave to rest for 20 minutes.  The [[Dough|dough]] should be fairly sticky, so add more water if necessary.\n| Knead, using your desired method until you have an elastic [[Dough|dough]].\n| Shape into a ball and leave it to rest for an hour in an oiled bowl, covered with [[Clingfilm|clingfilm]], until the [[Dough|dough]] has almost doubled in size.\n| Lightly [[Flour|flour]] a work surface and gently deflate the [[Dough|dough]].\n| Knead briefly and repeat the two previous steps.\n| Gently spread the [[Dough|dough]] on a floured work surface and roll out until it is about 5mm thick.\n| Using a plain 6cm [[Pastry|pastry]] cutter cut out circles of [[Dough|dough]] and place them on a [[Baking tray|baking tray]].\n| Lightly dampen the circles with water.\n| Cut out the equivalent number of circles again and place on top of the others.\n| Dampen the top circles and go through the same process a 3rd time.\n| Cover with a damp cloth and leave to prove for up to 45 minutes.\n| [[Bake]] at 230\u00b0 C (450\u00b0 F - gas 8), [fan [[Oven|oven]] 210\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour] for 15-20 minutes. \n| Allow to cool on a wire rack.\n}}\n===Variations===\n* Stages 1-11 can be done in a food [[Mixer|mixer]].\n* Stages 6-11 can be done in a [[Breadmaker|breadmaker]] on the longest [[Dough|dough]] setting.\n*Stages 1-11 can also be done in a [[Thermomix]]. Add the sponge ingredients all together, having dissolved the [[Yeast|yeast]]. Mix for 6-20 seconds at Speed 3 until the [[Dough|dough]] has formed into a ball that begins to clean the sides of the bowl. Add the remaining [[Flour|flour]] and the [[Salt|salt]] the next day and [[Kneading bread|knead]] for 90 seconds at the kneading setting. Tip the TM bowl upside down on a lightly floured surface . Loosen the blades by undoing the blade unit at the base. The weight of the blades will [[Help|help]] the dough to drop out of the bowl onto the surface. Pull any remaining bits of dough off the blades and out of the bowl. Continue from step 12. \n===Chef's notes===\nYou will find that the rolls slant somewhat during rising but that is part of their charm!  The more they slant, the longer they may need baking.\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Bread and baking]]\n[[Category:Vegan recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes]]\n[[Category:Breadmaker recipes]]\n[[Category:Thermomix recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#dough #flour #yeast #clingfilm #bread #breadmaker #thermomix #mixer #bake #sieve #kneadingbread </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
