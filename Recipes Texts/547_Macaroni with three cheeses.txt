It also has the benefit of [[Roast garlic|roast garlic]] mixed in with it.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 20 ml [[Butter|butter]] or [[Olive oil|olive oil]]\n| 2 tablespoons [[Plain flour|plain flour]]\n| 300 ml semi-skimmed [[Milk|milk]]\n| Large pinch [[Rock salt|rock salt]]\n| Freshly [[Grated|grated]] [[Nutmeg|nutmeg]] and [[Black pepper|black pepper]], to taste\n| 40 g [[Wells Alpine cheese]], chopped into small pieces\n| 40 g Vintage [[Lincolnshire Poacher cheese]], chopped into small pieces\n| 80 g [[Tetilla Cheese|tetilla cheese]], chopped into small pieces\n| 2 bulbs [[Roasted garlic|roasted garlic]], squeezed\n| 400g (14 oz) [[Macaroni|macaroni]] - dry weight\n\n}}\n\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n* Preheat the oven to 220\u00b0C (425\u00b0F - Gas Mk 7) \n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Melt the [[Butter|butter]] over a medium heat.\n| Add the [[Flour|flour]], little by little, stirring constantly in a figure of 8 until thick and smooth - a balloon whisk is good for this.\n| Reduce heat to low and cook for a few minutes, stirring occasionally.  Do not allow to [[Brown|brown]].\n| Remove from heat and add the [[Milk|milk]] slowly - again stirring constantly in a figure of 8 until thick and smooth.\n| Stir in the [[Salt|salt]], [[Nutmeg|nutmeg]] and [[Pepper|pepper]].\n| Add the [[Cheeses|cheeses]] and allow them to melt, still over a low heat and stir from time to time and add the squeezed [[Garlic|garlic]].\n| Bring some water to the [[Boil|boil]] and cook the [[Macaroni|macaroni]] for the time indicated on the packet.\n| Meanwhile, using a stick [[Blender|blender]] or [[Food processor|food processor]], blitz the [[Sauce|sauce]] until it is smooth.\n| Drain the [[Macaroni|macaroni]] and place in an [[Oven|oven]]-proof dish and pour the [[Sauce|sauce]] over it.\n| Sprinkle with extra [[Cheese|cheese]]\n| Bake in the oven for 15 to 20 minutes until the [[cheese]] has melted and the macaroni has crisped a little.\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nOn its own or with [[Salad|salad]].  Even eat it cold for breakfast :-)\n===Variations===\nThe [[Cheeses|cheeses]] can be substituted as none of them are that easy to get.  For [[Wells Alpine]], you can use [[Gruy\u00e8re]]; for [[Lincolnshire Poacher]], a good, strong [[Cheddar]] would be excellent.  Tetilla is more difficult to substitute as it is quite a unique [[Cheese|cheese]].  You need something with a soft texture, but not of the [[Brie]] type.  The nearest I can think of in texture, but not flavour, is [[Havarti]]. \nThis is a VERY rich version of [[Macaroni cheese|macaroni cheese]] and it is not advisable to eat this too late in the evening!  It can be thinned down with [[Vegetable stock|vegetable stock]] if you prefer it to be lighter or if you want it to be even richer, you can chuck in some [[Dry sherry|dry sherry]], [[Wine|wine]] or [[Cider|cider]].\n===Chef's notes===\nJust experiment with this recipe by adding whatever you like, such as [[Celery|celery]] [[Seeds|seeds]], [[Chillies|chillies]], [[Paprika|paprika]] \n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes|Macaroni with three cheeses]]\n[[Category:Cooking with beer|Macaroni]]\n[[Category:Cheese recipes|Macaroni with three cheeses]]\n[[Category:British recipes|Macaroni with three cheeses]]\n[[Category:Garlic recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses|Macaroni with three cheeses]]\n[[Category:Pasta recipes|Macaroni with three cheeses]]\n[[Category:Snacks and light bites|Macaroni with three cheeses]]\n[[Category:Starters|Macaroni with three cheeses]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes|Macaroni with three cheeses]]\n[[Category:Boiled or simmered]][[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#macaroniwiththreecheeses #macaroni #cheeses #cheese #butter #nutmeg #sauce #cheddar #blender #wellsalpine #celery </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
