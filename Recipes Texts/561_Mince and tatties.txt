Especially when leftovers were re-fried as a sort of bubble-and-squeak.''\n\n''I would also recommend a big dollop of brown sauce to complete this meal, though I don't know how Scottish that is!'' --[[User:Chef|Chef]] 18:22, 27 September 2011 (BST)\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:Steamed]]\n[[Category:Boiled or simmered]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#minceandtatties #lentils #mushrooms #leeks #potatoes #sweetcorn #butter #onions #oliveoil #beefmince #vegetable </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
