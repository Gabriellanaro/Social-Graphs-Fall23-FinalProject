Peel the [[parsnips]], do not slice. \n| Either cook in a small amount of unsalted water until tender or put into a steamer, cover and cook over boiling water.\n| If boiling the [[parsnips]], then dry well on kitchen paper. If steaming the parsnips, simply remove from the steamer and dry.\n| Slice the cooked parsnips and put into a bowl and mash, add a few drops only of banana essence or extract. The easiest way to obtain a small amount of essence or extract is to dip a skewer into the bottle and then hold this over the bowl so the drops fall.\n| Continue adding banana flavouring until you get the right taste. Add [[sugar]] to taste then mash until smooth.\n}}\n\nUse as a sandwich filling or as a pudding with yogurt or custard.\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes|Bananas]]\n[[Category:Historic recipes|Bananas]]\n[[Category:Sweets and desserts|Bananas]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Boiled or simmered]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#parsnips #mockbananas #unusualrecipes #banana #bananas </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
