Meanwhile...\n| Wash the [[Mushrooms|mushrooms]] -  best practice suggests [[Brushing|brushing]] mushrooms, that might be fine for a handful, but we had 2 kilograms to clean! The water in the bucket we used to wash the mushrooms was very black and mucky afterwards.\n| Lay them out on [[Tea|tea]]-towels to dry a little before slicing them finely in a [[Food processor|food processor]].\n| Add the [[Mushrooms|mushrooms]] to the cooked [[Onions|onions]], stir well and [[Simmer|simmer]] for 10 minutes.\n| If you are going to keep some of the sliced [[Mushrooms|mushrooms]] back to add after blending for a chunkier [[Soup|soup]], reserve a ladle-full of them at this stage.\n| Temporarily remove from the heat and sprinkle all of the [[Flour|flour]] over the [[Mushroom|mushroom]] mixture, stirring all the while to make a [[Roux|roux]].\n| Add the [[Milk|milk]] and [[Vegetable Stock|vegetable stock]] and mix well.\n| Bring to the [[Boil|boil]], lower the heat, cover and [[Simmer|simmer]] for 10 minutes stirring now and then.\n| Allow to cool for 5 minutes and then in small batches, carefully [[Blend|blend]] in a [[Food processor|food processor]].\n| Add any reserved [[Mushrooms|mushrooms]] back at this stage, reheat  and serve immediately with crusty [[Bread|bread]] and a sprinkle of [[Fresh herbs|fresh herbs]].\n}}\n===Recipe source===\n\n* A composite of ideas taken from four cookbooks including The New Covent Garden Soup Company's \"Book of Soups\", ISBN 075220503X and Debra Mayhew's \"The Soup Bible\", ISBN 0760790450\n===Variations===\nOn one batch we reserved a ladle of sliced [[Mushrooms|mushrooms]] and added them back after the blending, the other was fully blended.  Both had a lovely texture, worlds apart from tinned [[Soup|soup]].\n===Chef's notes===\nThis freezes very well.  Ladle the cold soup into plastic bags on a large tray and carefully freeze the whole tray, sealing the bags up once fully frozen.\n==See also==\n\n* Kentdown Mushroom Farm, Scudders Hill, Fawkham, Longfield, Kent, DA3 8PA.
