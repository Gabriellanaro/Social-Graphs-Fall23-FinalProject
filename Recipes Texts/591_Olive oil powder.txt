You must ensure that you measure the two ingredients by '''volume''' and not by weight.  In general the [[Maltodextrin|maltodextrin]] should be twice the volume of the [[Olive oil|olive oil]]\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| 50ml [[Olive oil|olive oil]]\n| 100ml [[Tapioca maltodextrin]] (also sold as [[Zorbit]] or [[El Bull\u00ed Texturas Malto]])\n}}\n\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| Simply mix the [[Tapioca maltodextrin]] gradually with the [[Olive oil|olive oil]]\n| Pass through a [[Sieve|sieve]] \n| If a more powdery texture is desired, pass through a [[Sieve|sieve]] once more, using a finer mesh\n| Store in a container in the [[Fridge|fridge]] until required\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nSprinkle over [[Salad|salad]] leaves or any [[Ingredient|ingredient]] that would normally be dressed in, or drizzled with [[Olive oil|olive oil]].  For the best effect make sure that the surface of the ingredients is as dry as possible\n===Variations===\nYou can use almost any [[Oil|oil]] you like instead of [[Olive oil|olive oil]]\n===Chef's notes===\nWhilst it is plainly obvious that the addition of a sufficient quantity of [[Starchy|starchy]] powder to [[Oil|oil]] would necessarily create an oil powder, the magic happens when the powder is put into the mouth.  When you do this, the powder reverts back to the flavour and texture of pure oil.  This is because [[Tapioca maltodextrin]], whilst not [[Fat|fat]] soluble, ''is'' water soluble, which is why you should only sprinkle it on ingredients which have been patted dry.\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Molecular gastronomy recipes]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Spanish recipes]]\n[[Category:Marinades dressings and butters]]\n[[Category:Vegan recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes]]\n[[Category:Uncooked]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#oliveoil #oliveoilpowder #tapiocamaltodextrin #sieve #maltodextrin #fridge #salad #moleculargastronomy #zorbit #fat #starchy </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
