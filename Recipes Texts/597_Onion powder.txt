However you can easily make your own at home.  If you do not have a [[Food dehydrators|dehydrator]], you can dry them in the [[Oven|oven]] on its lowest setting in which case they will dry quicker (although their nutritional value will be reduced).\n[[Image:Dehydrated onion rings.jpg|300px|thumb|right|Dehydrated onion rings]]\n\nThe time given below for dehydrating is approximate as it does depend on the temperature and humidity of your kitchen.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| 2 kg of  fresh [[Onions|onions]], cut into 4 mm slices.\n| Pinch of [[salt]]\n}}\n\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Add a pinch of salt to the onion slices\n| Dehydrate the [[Onions|onions]] for 7 hours at 60\u00b0C for 2 hours, then 50\u00b0C for the remaining 6 hours.\n| Grind the [[Onions|onions]] using a [[Food processor|food processor]] or [[Thermomix]], until you have a powder of the desired consistency.\n| Keep in jar or [[Lock & Lock box]].\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nUse in [[Soups|soups]] and [[Stews|stews]] or as part of a [[Spice|spice]] mix or rub.  Also use when [[Cooking sous vide|cooking sous vide]] as raw [[Onions|onions]] can take on a metallic taste.\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Marinades dressings and butters]]\n[[Category:Vegan recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegetable recipes]]\n[[Category:Dehydrated]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#onionpowder #onions #spice #fooddehydrators #onion #foodprocessor #thermomix #cookingsousvide #dehydrated #soups #stews </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
