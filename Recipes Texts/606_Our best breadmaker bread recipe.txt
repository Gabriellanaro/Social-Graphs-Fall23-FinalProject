We now [[Bake|bake]] [[Bread|bread]] every two days and we have come up with a recipe that never fails to make a light airy loaf.\n\nWe add a little bit of [[Wholemeal flour|wholemeal flour]], just for a little interest, but not enough to make a heavy loaf.\n\nWe've made this in a variety of [[Panasonic Breadmakers]] which all have a 'French bake' setting.  This is an extended rise and gives a very light airy loaf.  You cannot make an extra large loaf with this setting as it rises too much.  it would probably work on a normal setting if your breadmaker does not have 'French bake'.\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| 1 teaspoon Allinson's Easy [[Bake]] [[Yeast]] - See [[Chef's notes|chef's notes]] below for other types of yeast.\n| 200g [[Strong white flour|strong white flour]]\n| 200g [[Strong brown flour|strong brown flour]]\n| 2 pinches of [[Ascorbic acid|ascorbic acid]]\n| 1 teaspoon of [[Sugar|sugar]]\n| 1 teaspoon of [[Salt|salt]]\n| 20g [[Vegetable oil|vegetable oil]]\n| 280g water\n}}\n\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| Although the instructions say to put the [[Yeast|yeast]] in the separate compartment, we always tip everything together in the [[Breadmaker|breadmaker]] bin.  It's up to you.\n| If you are not using a fast [[Easy Bake Yeast]] , then '''activate it first''' - [[How to activate Allinsons Dried Active Yeast|'''instructions are here''']].\n| Set the breadmaker to 'French Bake'  setting (#8 on the [[Panasonic SD-ZB2502]])\n| Your loaf should be ready after 6 hours.  Put a timer on so you don;t forget it as it will collapse if you leave it in the [[Breadmaker|breadmaker]] for an extended period after if has completed the [[Baking|baking]] cycle.\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nCategory:Favourite recipes\n===Chef's notes===\nIf you do buy [[Allinsons Dried Active Yeast]] and want to use it in a [[breadmaker]] you need to '''activate it first''' - [[How to activate Allinsons Dried Active Yeast|'''instructions are here''']].\n\nWe ''always'' use [[olive oil]] in our [[breadmaking]] as we don't keep standard [[vegetable oil]] anymore.\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:French recipes]]\n[[Category:Bread and baking]]\n[[Category:Grain and bean recipes]]\n[[Category:Breadmaker recipes]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n[[Category:Favourite recipes]]\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:12032020'>#breadmaker #howtoactivateallinsonsdriedactiveyeast #yeast #vegetableoil #bake #bread #breadmaking #ascorbicacid #easybakeyeast #strongwhiteflour #grainandbeanrecipes</code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
