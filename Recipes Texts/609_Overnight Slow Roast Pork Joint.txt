His recipe is fine but the quantities are far too large as that would serve 12 people!  I've reduced the quantities so the recipe should serve about 6 people and the ingredients are more easily available and affordable.\n\nThe original recipe used a bulb of fennel which was not available from any of our local suppliers, so as we try to only source local products, I picked some apples from our neighbour's tree and used those instead \ud83d\ude09. \n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| 1 tablespoon whole [[Fennel seeds|fennel seeds]]\n| &#189; teaspoon [[Freshly ground black pepper|freshly ground black pepper]]\n| 2 teaspoons of pink [[Sea Salt|sea salt]]\n| 3 [[apples]], cored and roughly cut up, no need to peel\n| 2 large [[Carrots|carrots]], peeled and sliced\n| 2 large [[Onions|onions]], peeled and sliced\n| 1 whole bulb of [[Garlic|garlic]], separated into [[Cloves|cloves]] which are then peeled and  crushed under a [[Knife|knife]]\n| Bunch of fresh [[Thyme leaves|thyme leaves]]\n| 10 fresh [[Sage leaves|sage leaves]]\n| 2.2 kg boneless [[Pork shoulder|pork shoulder]], rolled and tied\n| 4 tablespoons [[Olive oil|olive oil]]\n| half a bottle of [[White wine|white wine]]\n| &#189; pint of [[Chicken stock|chicken stock]]\n}}\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n\n* Pre heat your [[Oven|oven]] to the highest setting - remember this is only for the first 15 minutes roasting.\n\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| Grind the [[Fennel seeds|fennel seeds]] and [[Salt|salt]] together in a [[Spice|spice]] mill or [[Coffee grinder|coffee grinder]] and set to one side.\n| Add a good glug of [[Olive oil|olive oil]] to the base of a large [[Roasting tray|roasting tray]] and layer all of the [[Onions|onions]], [[Garlic|garlic]], [[Herbs|herbs]], [[Spices|spices]] and sliced [[Vegetables|vegetables]] in the tray.\n| Carefully cut slashes in the [[Pork|pork]] skin using a [[Stanley knife]].
