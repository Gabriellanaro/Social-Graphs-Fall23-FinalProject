This dish can be a little greasy, so be sure to trim off all of the excess fat.\n\nThis makes two different meals if you save the leftovers and make oxtail soup with them.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 3 tablespoons [[Plain flour|plain flour]]\n| 2 kg [[Oxtail|oxtail]], trimmed of any excess [[Fat|fat]]\n| [[Sea Salt|sea salt]] and [[Freshly ground black pepper|freshly ground black pepper]]\n| [[Olive oil]]\n| 800g [[Soffritto|soffritto]]\n| 4 Cloves of [[Garlic|garlic]], peeled and crushed\n| 2 X 440 ml cans of [[Guinness]] original \n| 250 ml [[Beef Stock|beef stock]]\n| 4 tablespoons [[Tomato|tomato]] pur\u00e9e\n}}\n\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n* Preheat the [[Oven|oven]] to 150\u00b0 C (300\u00b0 F - gas 2)\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Oxtail stew in Guinness oven ready.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Ready for 5.5 hours stewing\nImage:Oxtails, browning.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Brown the oxtails\nImage:Coat with seasond flour (cheat).jpg|thumb|300px|right|Add seasoned flour & meat, close lid and shake\nImage:Oxtail stew in Guinness ingredients.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The ingredients (900g carrots & swedes)\n</gallery>\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Season the [[Flour|flour]] well with [[Salt|salt]] and [[Pepper|pepper]]\n| In batches (by using a plastic bag or a [[Lock & Lock]]-type box) add the seasoned [[Flour|flour]] and the trimmed [[Oxtail|oxtail]] and shake well to coat\n| Heat a few tablespoons of [[Olive oil|olive oil]] in a flame-proof [[Casserole|casserole]] and [[Fry|fry]] the [[Oxtail|oxtail]] in batches for 2 minutes a side or until nicely [[Browned|browned]].  Set aside and repeat until all of the [[Meat|meat]] is done, using more [[Olive|olive]] [[Oil|oil]] if needed.\n| Add a little more [[Olive oil|olive oil]] and saut\u00e9 the [[Garlic|garlic]] and [[Soffritto|soffritto]] for 4 minutes, stirring regularly.\n| Add the [[Oxtail|oxtail]] back into the [[Casserole dish|casserole dish]] together with the [[Guinness]], [[Stock|stock]] and [[Tomato|tomato]] pur\u00e9e.\n| Stir well, bring to the [[Boil|boil]] and then carefully transfer to the [[Oven|oven]].\n| Cook for 5 &#189; hours, stirring occasionally.\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nEither; [[Jacket potatoes]], [[spaghetti]] or [[pasta]], [[mashed potatoes]] or simply, nice crusty bread.\n===Chef's notes===\n''My'' soffritto: I used 2 x 450g packets of chopped [[carrots]] and [[swedes]], 4 sticks of [[celery]] plus finely chopped [[cutting celery]] leaves (I like celery) and 4 medium onions, all trimmed, peeled and chopped.  What, and which vegetables is not madly critical, use what you most prefer.  Use the leaves from the celery if they are available, if not, some parsley would be fine. I also stirred in the unused seasoned flour at the beginning.\n===Oxtail soup from the leftovers===\nEasy oxtail soup from the leftovers. Refrigerate the leftovers and the next day, skim the fat from the surface.  Remove the [[bones]] and add the leftovers to a [[food processor]]. With clean hands, pull all of the meat from the [[bones]] and add that the the [[blender]]. Pulse it a few times to blend the mixture and add extra water if needed to thin (I used 250 ml). Cook 100g of broken spaghetti, add that to the soup and reheat for perfect oxtail soup.  Serve with crusty bread.\n==See also==\n* [[Slow roast recipes]]\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Beef recipes]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Cooking with beer]]\n[[Category:Historic recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:Offal recipes]]\n[[Category:Stews and casseroles]]\n[[Category:Stewed, braised or pot roasted]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#oxtailstewinguinness #oxtail #oliveoil #soffritto #tomato #bones #guinness #flour #garlic #oxtailstew #blender </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
