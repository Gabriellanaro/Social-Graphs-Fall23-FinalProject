The tongue should be salted separately.\n|Put the head into a pan with water to cover, a few peppercorns, salt ,a bunch of herbs , and vegetable trimmings.\n| Simmer till the [[bones]] and meat all fall to pieces, then drain into a basin.\n| Take out every scrap of bone and gristle and chop the meat  finely, sprinkling with powdered herbs and pepper.\n| Press into a mould set with a weight on top, and turn out when cold.\n| Garnish with parsley and serve with pickles and roast potatoes.\n| The broth, strained and boiled with oatmeal, onions, or a strongly flavoured vegetable such as celery, makes a meaty soup.\n}}\n\n''Note'':  Be sure you put the  remnants, [[bones]], vegetables, etc., out for the fowls to pick clean.
