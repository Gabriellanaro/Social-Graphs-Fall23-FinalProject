Take it from me, it's easy to boil this one dry - and it stinks when you do!\n| Drain the cooked [[split peas]]\n| Blend in a [[food processor]] or press through a [[sieve]] or a [[potato ricer]]\n| Beat in the egg and [[butter]] and season well\n| I use a glug of [[white wine vinegar]] to thin this down if needed, but I have strange tastes\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\n\nCut into sensibly proportioned cubes, wrap tightly in [[tin foil]] and [[freeze]]\n\nWhen required, [[defrost]] naturally and microwave for 3 minutes or so.\n===Variations===\nGeordie hummus joke aside, yesterday I turned our pease pudding into [[hummus]] - fantastic it was too.  I crushed  4 cloves of garlic and sauteed them in 4 tablespoons of olive oil until they just started to colour and then stirred the mixture into the pease pudding.\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Accompaniments]]\n[[Category:Dips and sauces]]\n[[Category:Grain and bean recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegetable recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Boiled or simmered]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#peasepudding #splitpeas #onion #butter #bouquetgarni #whitewinevinegar #sieve #boiledorsimmered #bacon #egg #simmer </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
