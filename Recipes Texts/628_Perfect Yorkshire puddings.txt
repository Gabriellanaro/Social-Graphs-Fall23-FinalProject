However, over the years we have had a few failures and I would heartily now recommend this recipe instead.  \n\nThis recipe is far simpler and has never failed for me.  I believe this recipe originates from Brian Turner, the famous Yorkshire chef.\n\n''Use the history button above if you wish to view the previous recipe.''\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| Vegetable oil\n| &frac12; cup of [[whole milk]] (125 ml or 125 g or 4.6 oz) - ''[[Milk|Skimmed]] or [[semi-skimmed milk]] does not work as well''.\n| 3 tablespoons of water\n| &frac12; cup of [[plain flour]] (75g or 2.6 oz)\n| &frac12; cup of [[eggs]] (2 large eggs or 3 small eggs)\n| A pinch of salt\n\n}}\n\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n* Preheat the oven to 220\u00b0 C (425\u00b0 F - Gas 7)\n\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Select your measure and use it to measure out equal quantities of [[whole milk]], [[plain flour]] and [[eggs]] - 1 cup takes about 5 medium eggs.\n| Tip the flour, eggs, milk and water into a bowl and add a generous pinch of salt.\n| Whisk by hand until all of the lumps are beaten out of the flour and no more.  Don't over-beat the batter - it is not necessary.\n| Leave the mixture to rest '''at room temperature'' for 30 minutes''' if you have the time.\n| Generously grease a metal [[baking tray]] (about 28 cm x 18 cm - 11\" x 7\") with the [[vegetable oil]] -  [[brushing]] works well here.\n| Place the tray in the middle of the oven until and leave until the oil is hot and almost smoking\n| Pour the batter mixture into the very hot tray\n| Bake for 20 minutes in the middle of the oven.\n}}\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Yorkshire pudding batter mixture.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Yorkshire pudding mixture ready for the oven\nImage:Yorkshire pudding batter measures.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Plain flour, whole milk & eggs in equal quantities. (''whole cup measures used here'')\n</gallery>\n===Chef's notes===\n\nThis recipe always rises well and creates perfectly formed puddings, but they do tend to be rather 'puddingy' (almost sponge-like), probably because of the amount of eggs in comparison with [[Delia Smith's Yorkshire pudding recipe]].\n==See also==\n* [[Popover]]\n* [[Toad in the hole]]\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Accompaniments]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#eggs #plainflour #wholemilk #perfectyorkshirepuddings #blacktreacle #jam #miseenplace #bakingtray #roastbeef #vegetableoil #lemonjuice </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
