Whilst some recipes and available ingredients improve with age, you really can't beat this 1860's classic.\n[[Image:Pickled beetroot recipe - small scale ingredients.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The ingredients for 1 litre of pickled beets]]\n\nThis recipe makes quite a large quantity, '''[[Pickled beetroot recipe (1 litre qty)|see here for a recipe using smaller quantities]]''', more suited to those who want to try the recipe out.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 2 kg medium-sized [[Beetroots|beetroots]]\n| 2 [[Litres|litres]] clear (white) [[Pickling|pickling]] [[Vinegar|vinegar]]\n| 25 g whole [[Allspice berries|allspice berries]]\n| 25 g [[Black peppercorns|black peppercorns]]\n\n}}\n\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n* Wash the [[Beetroot|beetroot]] free of any dirt but do not scrub hard and be careful not to nick the skins (or they will leach colour).\n* Trim the leaves and the tap-root.\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Bring a large pan of water to a [[Boil|boil]], add the [[Beetroot|beetroot]] and [[Simmer|simmer]]  for 90 minutes.\n| Drain the [[Beetroot|beetroot]] and set aside to cool. \n| Once cool enough to handle, rub the skins off and trim as needed.\n| Cut into slices about 12mm thick.\n| Pack the slices into [[Sterilised|sterilised]] [[Kilner]]-type jars.\n| Meanwhile, add the [[Vinegar|vinegar]] and the [[Spices|spices]] to a large pan and in a well-ventilated room, bring to a [[Boil|boil]] and continue to boil for 10 minutes.\n| Remove from the heat and allow to cool.\n| You can strain the spices through a linen cloth or leave them in.  I enjoy my pickles quite spicy so tend to leave them in, especially if I have added extra [[dried chillies]]!\n| Pour the [[Vinegar|vinegar]] over the [[Beetroot|beetroot]], ensuring that it is totally covered.\n| Seal the jars securely, mark them with the date and set aside in a cool, dark, cupboard and allow to mature for a few weeks before use.\n}}\n===Chef's notes===\nIf you need to ensure that you have enough jars, [[Vinegar|vinegar]] and [[Beetroot|beetroot]], pack the sliced beetroot into your jars, cover with water, then measure the water used to calculate how much [[Vinegar|vinegar]] etc. you'll need.\n\nPat the beetroot slices dry again, before pickling.\n==See also==\n* [[Beetroot recipes|Our favourite beetroot recipes]]\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Accompaniments]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Historic recipes]]\n[[Category:Pickles and preserves]]\n[[Category:Snacks and light bites]]\n[[Category:Vegetable recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegan recipes]]\n[[Category:Pickled]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#beetroot #vinegar #pickledbeetrootrecipe #kilner #boil #miseenplace #blackpeppercorns #cookipedia #sterilised #pickled #driedchillies </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
