This recipe also uses ''off the (supermarket) shelf ingredients''.  You don't even need a [[Kilner jar]], the jar that contains the Sarson's pickling vinegar can be sterilised by a hot wash in the dishwasher and used to store the pickled beetroot.  You'll even have some spare spicy vinegar left over for your fish and chips.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 1 x 500 g bunch of beetroots (about 5 to 7 medium sized beetroots\n| 1 x 1.14 litre jar of Sarson's clear white pickling vinegar\n|* The vinegar purports to be already ''spiced'', but I like to add a little zip to my [[pickles]], hence the pickling spices..\n| 1 x 26g packet of Schwartz `Pickling Spice' '''pictured''\n\n}}\n\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n* Wash the [[Beetroot|beetroot]] free of any dirt but do not scrub hard and be careful not to nick the skins (or they will leach colour).\n* Trim the leaves, leaving a few mm of the stem and remove the tap-root without cutting the skin of the beetroot.\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Bring a large pan of water to a [[Boil|boil]], add the [[Beetroot|beetroot]] and [[Simmer|simmer]]  for 90 minutes.\n| Drain the [[Beetroot|beetroot]] and set aside to cool. \n| Once cool enough to handle, rub the skins off and properly trim the stems and roots.\n| Cut into slices about 12mm thick.\n| [[Sterilise]] the Pickling vinegar jar (or a  1 litre [[Kilner jar]] - A hot wash in the dishwasher should suffice for home use.\n| Pack the slices into the jar.\n| Meanwhile, add the all of the [[Vinegar|vinegar]] and all of the the [[Spices|spices]] to a large pan, and in a well-ventilated room, bring to a [[Boil|boil]] and continue to boil for 10 minutes.\n| Remove from the heat and allow to cool completely.\n| You can strain the spices through a clean cloth or leave them in.  I enjoy my pickles quite spicy so tend to leave them in.\n| Pour the [[Vinegar|vinegar]] over the [[Beetroot|beetroot]], ensuring that it is totally covered.\n| Seal the jars securely and set aside in a cool, dark, cupboard and allow to mature for a few weeks before use.\n| Strain any remaining vinegar through a clean cloth and bottle to use as a spicy condiment.\n}}\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Beetroots, trimmed and ready to boil.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Beetroots, trimmed prior to boiling for 90 minutes\nImage:Pickled beetroot recipe - small scale ingredients.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The ingredients for 1 litre of pickled beets, available from any supermarket\n</gallery>\n===Servings===\nServings: 60 - Will fill a 1 litre jar with pickled beetroot\n==See also==\n* [[Beetroot recipes|Our favourite beetroot recipes]]\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Accompaniments]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Historic recipes]]\n[[Category:Pickles and preserves]]\n[[Category:Snacks and light bites]]\n[[Category:Vegetable recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegan recipes]]\n[[Category:Pickled]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#beetroot #kilnerjar #boil #vinegar #miseenplace #sterilise #pickled #simmer #pickles #spices </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
