Your imagination is the only limit.\n\nTry making up your own blend of [[vinegar]] using various vinegar types, make the tester up in very small amounts, tasting as you go, so when you have a good blend you will have the ratios to get the final amount the same as your tester.\n\nJust ensure the [[eggs]] you are using are at least 3 days old or you will not be able to peel them easily\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 24 medium [[boiled eggs]], shelled\n| 500 ml [[cider vinegar]]\n| 500 ml [[white wine vinegar]]\n| 1 [[onion]], peeled and sliced down from the top\n| 1/2 a teaspoon of [[mixed spice powder]]\n| 3 [[chipotle chillies]]\n| 4 cloves [[Garlic|garlic]], peeled and halved\n| 2 heaped teaspoons [[black treacle]] or [[molasses]]\n| 1 teaspoon [[sea salt]]\n| 1 tablespoon [[black peppercorns]]\n| 1 tablespoon [[turmeric powder]]\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| [[Boil]] all of the ingredients except the [[eggs]], for 10 minutes\n| Allow to cool completely\n| Drop the [[eggs]] into a 2.5 kg (5 lb) sterilised jar and pour in the [[vinegar]] mixture\n| If you don't have enough vinegar (unlikely) then make up the difference with cold water\n| Close and shake well\n| Leave for a month to mature, turning often to mix\n}}\n===Chef's note===\n\n[[Turmeric powder]] is fine but it does make the vinegar cloud badly every time you move the jar and also leaves a sludge in the bottom.  The same amount of [[turmeric root]] would be better if you can get hold of it.\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Accompaniments]]\n[[Category:Egg recipes]]\n[[Category:Pickles and preserves]]\n[[Category:Snacks and light bites]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Pickled]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#pickledeggs #eggs #vinegar #turmericpowder #blackpeppercorns #chickens #onion #whitewinevinegar #boil #turmericroot #garlic </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
