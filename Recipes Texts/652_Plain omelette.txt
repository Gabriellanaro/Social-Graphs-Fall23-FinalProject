Don't whisk - it's nice to get some white and yolk only areas in the omelette\n| Add the [[butter]] to a small frying pan\n| When the [[butter]] is foaming add the mixture to the pan\n| Fry for 2 minutes on this side, pulling the solid edges to the centre with a fork\n| Flip over and fry for 1 minute on the other side\n| Slide on to a warm serving plate, folding the omelette - this way, the last bit of cooking is done on the plate\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\n\nServe immediately\n\nAdd some tomatoes at the side and a leaf of coriander or mint so it looks different and tastier.\n\nAlso you can put a drop of mayonnaise on the top of the tomatoes and an olive.\n\n===Variations===\n\nExperiment using chopped herbs such as [[chives]] or [[parsley]].\n\nRub the pan with half a [[Garlic|garlic]] clove prior to frying (discard the garlic).\n\nAdd a handful of microwaved mixed vegetables just before folding over.\n\n{{OmeletteRecipes}}\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes|Omelette]]\n[[Category:Egg recipes|Omelette]]\n[[Category:Main courses|Omelette]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Student recipes]]\n[[Category:Pan fried]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#plainomelette #butter #eggs #garlic #parsley #chives #oliveoil #cream #blackpepper #panfried </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
