This is the version for making in a [[Thermomix]].\n\n{{RecipeIngredientsTM\n| 330ml [[Milk|milk]]\n| 550g [[Strong white bread flour|strong white bread flour]]\n| 7g fast action [[Yeast|yeast]]\n| 50g [[Olive oil|olive oil]]\n| &frac34; teaspoon [[Salt|salt]]\n| 1 large [[Egg|egg]], beaten\n| [[Oil]] for greasing\n| 1 [[egg]], beaten, for [[Brushing|brushing]]\n\n}}\n\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n* The evening before, mix all of the [[Milk|milk]], half (275g) of the [[Flour|flour]] and the [[Yeast|yeast]] in a bowl (do not use the TM bowl).\n* Cover with [[Clingfilm|clingfilm]] or a shower cap and leave overnight in the [[Fridge|fridge]].\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| The following morning, remove the bowl from the [[Fridge|fridge]] and allow to come up to room temperature.\n| Tip the mixture into the TM bowl together with the other 275g [[Flour|flour]] and the remaining ingredients.\n| [[Knead]], for '''4 minutes / Knead'''.\n| Leave in the TM bowl until it is pushing up the MC.\n| Shape into a ball and place in an oiled bowl and leave, covered until almost double its size.\n| Divide into 6 - use your scales - trying not to deflate the [[Dough|dough]] too much..\n| Roll each piece into '[[Sausages|sausages]]' about 20 cm in length. \n| Hold them upright in front of you and attach the ends to each other. \n| Take the first right-[[Hand|hand]] braid and pass over the following two (2-3) under 4 and over the last two (5-6).\n| At this stage, the first part finds itself at the end beyond braid 6 and braid 2 is found at the extreme right.\n| You continue as before, so take what is now braid 1, pass it over 2 and 3, under 4, and over 5 and 6.\n| Repeat these actions until the plait is complete and then seal the end.\n| Cover and allow to [[Proove|proove]].\n| [[Brush]] with the [[egg]] and [[Bake|bake]] in a preheated [[Oven|oven]] at 180\u00b0 C (350\u00b0 F - gas 4), [fan oven 160\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour], for 50 minutes.\n| You may wish to turn the [[Bread|bread]] round after 30 minutes, if your [[Oven|oven]] is like mine and cooks unevenly and I would recommend that you turn it upside down for the final 10 minutes of the cooking time.\n| When [[Baked|baked]], allow to cool on a wire rack.\n}}\n===Recipe source===\n* This is my own recipe, but the plaiting method is explained at '''[http://djouza.over-blog.com/article-pain-aux-oeufs-86664280.html Ma Cabane aux D\u00e9lices]'''.\n===Variations===\nAdd flavourings to taste, such as onion powder, tomato pur\u00e9e, seeds, grated cheese etc.\n===Chef's notes===\nThe plaiting was not that difficult, but you need to keep the braids quite tight.  When dividing your dough, use a metal dough cutter as this will give a cleaner cut.\n==See also==\n* [[Plaited bread|Here]] is a recipe for making this [[bread]] conventionally.\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Bread and baking]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes]]\n[[Category:Favourite recipes]]\n[[Category:Thermomix recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#egg #bread #flour #fridge #yeast #miseenplace #oliveoil #plaitedbread #brushing #brush #thermomixrecipes </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
