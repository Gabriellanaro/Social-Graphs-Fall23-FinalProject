This recipe is inspired by the Ploughmans' lunch: [[ham]], [[cheese]], [[Branston pickle]], [[tomatoes]] and variations thereof.  Following a true ploughmans', obviously [[Cheddar]] would be the [[cheese]] of choice, however, I spotted some lovely oak barrel aged [[feta]] so used that instead.\n\nThese deep-dish pizzas are excellent cooked the moment the dough has been made, but if time and conditions allow, they are even better if left in a warm place to rise first.  They then become light and airy with a sponge-like texture.  As this is a rare warm sunny day, I'm going to leave this one out to rise for a few hours before it's cooked.\n\n===How to ensure a crispy base===\nHaving made these deep pan pizzas many, many times, I've found that sometimes it's hard to get the base well cooked without burning the rest of the [[pizza dough]].  I've found the best way is to use a meta-based pan, similar to a baking tray.  The metal base gets hot enough to crisp the base properly.  I have a really heavy rectangular Le Creuset baking tray that is absolutely ideal.  It seems a shame as it will mean I'll never use my earthenware deep pan pizza dish again!\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 180 g good quality sliced [[ham]].\n| 1 portion of [[Pizza dough|pizza dough]]\n| [[Fine yellow cornmeal|fine yellow cornmeal]] for dusting\n| 150 g (5 oz) [[Feta cheese]], crumbled or sliced\n| 50 g (2 oz) freshly [[Grated|grated]] [[Parmesan cheese]]\n| 1 400 g can of chopped peeled [[Tomatoes|tomatoes]], left to drain over a coarse sieve for 15 minutes or more.\n| &#189; teaspoon of dried [[oregano]]\n| Freshly ground [[black pepper]]\n| 4 tablespoons [[Branston pickle]]\n\n}}\n\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n* Preheat the [[Oven|oven]] to 190\u00b0 C (375\u00b0 F - gas 5), [fan oven 170\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]\n* Make the [[Dough|dough]] as instructed\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Ploughmas deep pan pizza ready to rise.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Left to rise for an hour or so\nImage:Branston Pickle pizza.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Plenty of Branston pickle\n</gallery>\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| [[Spray]] or lightly [[Oil|oil]] a deep 25cm (10\") pizza dish or pan\n| Roll out two thirds of the [[Dough|dough]] to about 3mm and line a pan so the [[Dough|dough]] just  overlaps the edges and trim any excess\n| Sprinkle the base with two thirds of the [[Feta cheese]]\n| Layer the ham over the cheese.\n| Spread the [[Branston]] in a thick layer, over the ham.\n| Sprinkle with one third of the [[Parmesan cheese]]\n| Roll out the remaining [[Dough|dough]] to make a lid\n| Pinch the lid so it joins the base and make a few slashed in the top for [[Steam|steam]] to escape\n| Mix another third of the [[Parmesan cheese]] with the [[oregano]] and [[black pepper]] and mix into the [[Tomatoes|tomatoes]]\n| Spread the tomato mixture over the top of the [[Dough|dough]]\n| Top with remaining crumbled [[feta cheese]] and the rest of the [[Parmesan cheese]]\n| [[Bake]] for 45 minutes, resting a sheet of [[Tin-foil|tin-foil]] on top of the [[Pizza|pizza]] for the final 10 minutes\n| Allow to cool for 5 minutes before slicing and serving\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe with a [[Green salad|green salad]]\n\n===Chef's notes===\nA fantastic pizaa.
