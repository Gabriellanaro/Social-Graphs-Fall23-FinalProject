You could use water, [[Stock|stock]] , [[Wine|wine]] or [[Beer|beer]].  I used a splash of Stella [[Lager|lager]] to loosen them\n| Serve immediately\n}}\n===Variations===\nUse any variety of canned [[Beans|beans]] and practically anything you can think of.  Bottled [[Peppers|peppers]] are good because they don't require any cooking, however you could add fresh peppers for a little crunch, finely [[Chopped spring onions|chopped spring onions]], chillies, oh the list is endless!\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:North American recipes]]\n[[Category:Tex-Mex recipes]]\n[[Category:Accompaniments]]\n[[Category:Snacks and light bites]]\n[[Category:Starters]]\n[[Category:Tapas, mezze and antipasti]]\n[[Category:Vegan recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes]]\n[[Category:Grain and bean recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegetable recipes]]\n[[Category:Pan fried]]\n[[Category:Favourite recipes]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#beans #sundriedtomatopaste #bakedbeans #tomatopuree #peppers #popcorn #popped #redpepper #unusualrecipes #frying #steam </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
