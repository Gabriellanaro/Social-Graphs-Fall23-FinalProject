I also varied some of the ingredients to suit my larder:\n* [[Thyme]] - 2 x 3\" sprigs, added complete with stems, stems removed when the cooking had been completed.\n* [[Marjoram]], mine has gone to seed so I used 1/3 of a teaspoon of dried oregano.\n* I have no [[savory]], neither do I have a substitute, so it has been omitted completely. Reminder to self: add [[savory]] to my 'grow this next year' list.\n* I could not obtain [[veal]] on the day so I used [[rump steak]], finely sliced on the diagonal.\n* [[White wine]] or [[sherry]], 50 ml\n* [[Stock]], 100 ml\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe with [[Flour|flour]] [[Dumplings|dumplings]].\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes|Veal stew]]\n[[Category:Austrian recipes|Veal stew]]\n[[Category:Beef recipes|Veal stew]]\n[[Category:Main courses|Veal stew]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes|Veal stew]]\n[[Category:Stews and casseroles|Veal stew]]\n[[Category:Veal recipes|Veal stew]]\n[[Category:Cooking with wine|Veal stew]]\n[[Category:Stewed, braised or pot roasted]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#veal #stock #savory #flour #butter #whitewine #onion #sherry #marjoram #boil #sourcream </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
