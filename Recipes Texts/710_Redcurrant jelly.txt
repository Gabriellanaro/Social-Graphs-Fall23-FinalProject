I love the idea of adding a few [[raspberries]].\n\nHave the [[fruit]] gathered in fine weather, July is ideal.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 9 litres [8 quarts] of [[redcurrants]]\n| To every 600ml (1 pint) of Juice allow:\n| 340g (12oz) [[Sugar]]\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Remove the stalks from the [[redcurrants]].\n| Put into a jar and place the jar in a saucepan of [[boiling]] water over the heat and let it [[simmer]] gently until the juice is well drawn from the [[currants]].\n| Strain them through a jelly bag or fine cloth. If a very clear jelly is wanted, do not squeeze them too much, as the skin and pulp from the [[fruit]] will be pressed through with the juice and so make the jelly muddy.\n| Measure the juice and to each 600ml (1 pint) allow 340g (12oz) of [[sugar]].\n| Put into a [[preserving]] pan, over the heat and keep stirring the jelly until it is done, carefully removing any scum as it rises, using a wooden or silver spoon for the purpose, as metal or iron ones would spoil the colour of the jelly.\n| When it has [[boiled]] for 20 to 30 minutes put a little of the jelly on a plate and if firm when cool, it is done.\n| Take it off the heat, pour it into small [[sterilised jars]], cover with airtight lids\n| Label the pots, adding the year when the jelly was made and store it away in a dry place.\n| A jam may be made with the [[currants]], if they are not squeezed too dry, by adding a few fresh [[raspberries]] and [[boiling]] all together, with enough [[sugar]] to sweeten it nicely.\n}}\n\nAs this preserve is not worth storing away, but is only for immediate eating, a smaller ratio of [[sugar]] than usual will be found enough: it answers very well for children\u2019s puddings or for a nursery preserve.\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Accompaniments]]\n[[Category:Dips and sauces]]\n[[Category:Historic recipes]]\n[[Category:Pickles and preserves]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Fruit recipes]]\n[[Category:Boiled or simmered]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#currants #redcurrantjelly #boiling #raspberries #fruit #redcurrants #boiledorsimmered #simmer #preserving #sterilisedjars </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
