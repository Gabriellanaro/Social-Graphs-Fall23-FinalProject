You can use about a tablespoon of [[lime juice]] instead.\n\nI've also used [[Taste Sensation]] Italian Seasoning, you can use [[ black pepper]] and a pinch of [[herbs]].\n===Chef's notes===\nThis will be cooked after an hour but could easily be cooked for twice that time and at almost any temperature.  Eg: just add it to whatever else you are cooking at the time.\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Accompaniments]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes]]\n[[Category:Fruit recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegetable recipes]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:12032020'>#cabbage #apples #savoycabbage #tastesensationitalianseasoning #chickenstock #currants #roastcabbage #spices #accompaniments #tastesensation #vegetablerecipes</code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
