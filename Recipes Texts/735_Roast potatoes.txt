''Thank you Delia Smith''!\n| Add the [[bay leaves]] and [[peppercorns]] at this stage if making potato people\n| Add the [[oil]] or [[fat]] to the roasting tin and heat on the hob until the oil is almost smoking\n| Using tongs, turn the [[potatoes]] so they are all evenly covered with the oil or fat\n| Place the roasting tin on the top shelf of the oven and roast for 45-50 minutes\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\n\nServe hot with a little [[sea salt]] sprinkled over them\n\n===Variations===\n* Sprinkle with a little chopped herbs such as [[rosemary]] or [[thyme]].\n* Make [[bay]] flavoured potato people by making eyes from [[peppercorns]] and ears from halved [[bay leaves]].  Make slices in the potatoes and slot the leaves in.  This is much easier to do if the bay leaves are sliced in half.\n\n==Which are the best potatoes for roasting==\n* Desiree\n* King Edward\n* Rooster\n* Cara\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Accompaniments]]\n[[Category:Snacks and light bites]]\n[[Category:Potato recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegetable recipes]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Student recipes]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#potatoes #roastpotatoes #bayleaves #peppercorns #groundnutoil #fat #bay #goosefat #sunfloweroil #thyme #rosemary </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
