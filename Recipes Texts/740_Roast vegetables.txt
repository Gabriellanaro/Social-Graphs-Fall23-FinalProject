Certainly been making it regularly since then. Rather oddly, I never did get around to adding the recipe here. Time to make amends.\n[[Image:One tray oven roasted vegetables.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Ready for the oven]]\n\nSimply put; select the [[Vegetables|vegetables]] from your favourites, cut into even sized chunks, [[Oil|oil]], season and [[Roast|roast]].\n\nYou can cook [[Roast potatoes|roast potatoes]] in with the [[Vegetables|vegetables]], but I feel that roast potatoes deserve [[Roast potatoes|separate treatment]] for superior results.\n\nAs for quantities, judge what your guests would eat from the raw, prepared quantities, remembering that they will shrink quite a lot after cooking.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 6 medium [[Carrots|carrots]]\n| 6 medium [[Parsnips|parsnips]]\n| 1 small [[Butternut squash|butternut squash]], peeled and cut into chunks\n|Cut the squash slightly larger than the [[Carrots|carrots]] and [[Parsnips|parsnips]]\n| 2 medium [[Onions|onions]], peeled, each roughly cut into 6 pieces\n| 6 to 8 Cloves of [[Garlic|garlic]]\n| Big bunch of [[Thyme|thyme]]\n| Big bunch of [[Rosemary|rosemary]]\n| Handful of fresh [[Bay leaves|bay leaves]]\n| 2 teaspoons whole [[Cumin seeds|cumin seeds]]\n| 1 teaspoon whole [[Fennel seeds|fennel seeds]]\n| 1 teaspoon [[Chili flakes|chili flakes]]\n| [[Olive oil]]\n\n}}\n\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n* Pre heat the [[Oven|oven]] to 220\u00b0 C (425\u00b0 F - gas 7)\n* I've chosen this temperature as it matches the cooking time for [[Roast|roast]] potatoes. They will do just as well at 180\u00b0 C (350\u00b0 F - gas 4), though will take a little longer  \n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Peel and prepare all of the [[Vegetables|vegetables]] and cut into equal sized pieces, cut lengthways, not into discs.\n| [[Oil]] a large [[Oven|oven]] tray\n| Tip all the [[Vegetables|vegetables]] and whole bunches of [[Herbs|herbs]] into the tray, sprinkle with the seasonings, drizzle with a good few glugs of [[Olive oil|olive oil]] and mix well with your hands\n| Cover with [[Tin-foil|tin-foil]]\n| [[Roast]], covered, for 30 minutes, remove the [[Foil|foil]] and toss the [[Vegetables|vegetables]] in the [[Oil|oil]]\n| [[Roast]] for a further 10 to 20 minutes\n| Remove the woody [[Herbs|herbs]] and serve.\n}}\n===Variations===\nIf your guests  will enjoy the fun of squeezing out the pur\u00e9ed [[Garlic|garlic]] paste over their veg, leave the garlic un peeled, peel them for the more fastidious eaters.\n\n'''Other possibilities include:'''\n* [[Deglaze]] the tray with [[balsamic vinegar]] to release the caramelised sugars and make a drizzle for the vegetables.\n* [[Aubergine]]\n* [[Celeriac]]\n* [[Courgette]]\n* [[Leeks]]\n* [[Peppers]]\n* [[Potatoes]]\n* [[Salsify]]\n* [[Swede]]\n* [[Sweet potato]]\n* [[Tomatoes]]\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Accompaniments]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Vegetable recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegan recipes]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#vegetables #roast #parsnips #oliveoil #carrots #roastpotatoes #roastvegetables #herbs #garlic #celeriac #deglaze </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
