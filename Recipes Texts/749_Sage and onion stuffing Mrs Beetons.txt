The stuffing then, however is not nearly so mild, and to many tastes, its strong flavour would be very objectionable.\n| When made for [[Goose|goose]], a portion of the [[Liver|liver]] of the bird, [[Simmered|simmered]] for a few minutes and very finely [[Minced|minced]], is frequently added to this stuffing; and where economy is studied, the [[Egg|egg]] and [[Butter|butter]] may be dispensed with.\n}}\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Accompaniments]]\n[[Category:Historic recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes]]\n[[Category:Egg recipes]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:Poultry recipes]]\n[[Category:Boiled or simmered]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#butter #onions #egg #sage #simmer #sageleaves #liver #yolk #bread #breadcrumbs #boiledorsimmered </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
