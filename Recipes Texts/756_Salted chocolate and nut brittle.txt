Don't let it get too dark or the flavour will be [[Bitter|bitter]].  If you have a [[Thermometer|thermometer]] you are looking for a temperature of 146-155 C (295-310 F).\n| Remove from the heat, [[Dip|dip]] the base of the pan briefly in cold water to prevent further cooking and stir in the [[Nuts|nuts]] straight away.  You may find it easier to add the nuts slightly earlier before the mixture becomes too stiff.\n| Tip the mixture out onto the line [[Baking tray|baking tray]]. \n| Spread a thin layer with the back of a spoon or [[Palette knife|palette knife]] and leave to harden.\n| Melt the [[Chocolate|chocolate]], either in a heatproof bowl over a pan of gently [[Simmering|simmering]] water, or in short bursts in the [[Microwave|microwave]]. \n| Invert the brittle on a clean sheet of [[Baking|baking]] [[Parchment|parchment]] so the flat side is uppermost and spread with the [[Chocolate|chocolate]] using a [[Palette knife|palette knife]]. \n| Sprinkle with a little [[Salt|salt]].\n| Leave to set before breaking into chunky pieces.\n}}\n===Recipe source===\n\n* Lightly adapted from a '''[https://www.waitrose.com/content/waitrose/en/home/recipes/recipe_directory/h/peanut_brittle_withseasaltchocolate.A4.html Waitrose recipe]'''\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Sweets and desserts]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes]]\n[[Category:Boiled or simmered]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#chocolate #parchment #saltedchocolateandnutbrittle #bakingtray #paletteknife #nuts #castersugar #thermometer #boiledorsimmered #dip #simmering </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
