A street food inspired burger with a difference, the crunchy apple in the slaw is brilliant with the flavour of Perfect Pork Sausages. This recipe can be made [[Gluten free]] by using [[Udi's Gluten Free Products|Udi's GF White Rolls]].\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| 6 debbie&andrew's [[Perfect Pork sausages|perfect pork sausages]] \n| 4 large [[English muffins]] (use [[Gluten free|gluten free]] option if preferred, [[Udi's Gluten Free Products|Udi's GF White Rolls]])\n| 4 tablespoons [[Mango chutney|mango chutney]]\n| For the slaw:\n| &#188; head of white [[Cabbage|cabbage]], sliced super thin\n| 1 granny smith [[Apple|apple]], cored and [[Julienned|julienned]]\n| 1 teaspoon [[Cider vinegar|cider vinegar]]\n| 1 tablespoon [[Mayonnaise|mayonnaise]] (use [[Dairy]] Free option if preferred)\n| 2 tablespoons [[Soured cream|soured cream]] (use [[Dairy]] Free option if preferred)\n| &#189; teaspoon [[Curry powder|curry powder]]\n| [[Salt]] and [[Pepper|pepper]]\n| [[Oil]] for [[Frying|frying]]\n}}\n\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| Remove [[Sausage meat|sausage meat]] from skins.\n| Shape into 4 flat equal [[Burger|burger]] patties, cover with [[Cling Film|cling film]] and chill until needed.\n| Mix the slaw ingredients. Cover until needed.\n| Heat a [[Frying pan|frying pan]] with a dash of [[Oil|oil]] and add the patties, cooking for two to three minutes each side, and cook through in a hot [[Oven|oven]] for 5 minutes. [[Rest]] on a plate for 5 minutes.\n| Pull apart the [[Muffins|muffins]] with a fork instead of cutting with a knife and toast to your liking.\n| To assemble, on one half of a [[Muffin|muffin]], spoon on a tablespoon of [[Mango chutney|mango chutney]], add a patty, then a heaped tablespoon of the slaw and top with the remaining muffin half. Repeat with remaining [[Muffins|muffins]].\n}}\n===Chef's notes===\nSeparating the [[Muffins|muffins]]: Use a fork instead of a knife (this keeps the inside fluffy) to separate the [[Muffin|muffin]]. No muffins? A bun would work as well.\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:North American recipes]]\n[[Category:Breakfast recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Snacks and light bites]]\n[[Category:Tapas, mezze and antipasti]]\n[[Category:Fruit recipes]]\n[[Category:Gluten free recipes]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:Pork recipes]]\n[[Category:Salad recipes]]\n[[Category:Debbie&andrew's sausage recipes]]\n[[Category:Grilled, griddled or barbecued]]\n[[Category:Pan fried]]\n{{Template:DebbieAndAndrew attribution}}\n[[Category:Recipes from other sites]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#muffins #glutenfree #mangochutney #dairy #muffin #sausageandappleslawmuffin #currypowder #frying #mayonnaise #cabbage #sausage </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
