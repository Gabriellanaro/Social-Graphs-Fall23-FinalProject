The 'recipe' is here: [[Meatballs from sausages]]\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| Pinch of [[Black pepper|black pepper]]\n| 2 tablespoons of [[Olive oil|olive oil]]\n| 1 small [[Onion|onion]], very finely chopped\n| Cooked [[Meatballs|meatballs]] from 3 meaty [[Sausages|sausages]]\n| 1 portion of [[Pizza dough]] (makes 2 [[Pizzas|pizzas]])\n| About 6 tablespoons of [[Tomato sauce for pizza]] or [[Passata|passata]]\n| 2 balls [[Mozzarella cheese|mozzarella cheese]] torn into small pieces(about 250g in total)\n| Fresh [[Basil leaves|basil leaves]], chopped finely\n| [[Sea Salt|sea salt]] and [[Freshly ground black pepper|freshly ground black pepper]]\n| Half of a Polish pickled red pepper, chopped, ''optional''\n}}\n\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| Dust your work surface with [[Fine yellow cornmeal|fine yellow cornmeal]]\n| Divide the [[Pizza dough|pizza dough]] into two and roll out into two thin 25.5 cm (10 inch) [[Pizzas|pizzas]]\n| You can leave them in a [[Warm place|warm place]] for an hour or so to rise. I quite like them cooked immediately they are rolled out for a more crispy finish.\n| Prick the [[Pizza|pizza]] all over with a fork. This prevents it puffing up too much and burning while it is cooking\n| With a deft move, slide the [[Pizza|pizza]] from the [[Pizza peel|pizza peel]], on to the preheated [[Pizza stone|pizza stone]].\n| Cook on one side only for about 2 minutes or until lightly [[Browned|browned]].\n| Remove from the [[Oven|oven]] and distribute a ball of torn [[Mozzarella cheese|mozzarella cheese]] over the  [[Pizza|pizza]].\n| Spread the [[Tomato sauce|tomato sauce]] over the top of the [[Cheese|cheese]] -  this helps to keep the [[Pizza|pizza]] base dry and crispy.\n| Crumble the [[Meatballs|meatballs]] and arrange over the topping and drizzle with [[Olive oil|olive oil]] - preferably the [[Oil|oil]] the meatballs were cooked in.\n| Return to the [[Oven|oven]] and [[Bake|bake]] until the [[Cheese|cheese]] is nicely melted. This should take about 4 minutes under a [[Grill|grill]] on a [[Pizza stone|pizza stone]], if oven [[Baking|baking]], about 15 minutes in the middle of the oven.\n| Repeat for the second [[Pizza|pizza]].\n| Keep the first [[Pizza|pizza]] warm at the bottom of the [[Oven|oven]] whilst you make the second.\n}}\n===Chef's notes===\nUse a little extra [[Olive oil|olive oil]] when cooking the [[Sausage|sausage]] [[Meatballs|meatballs]] and use this flavored [[Oil|oil]] to top the [[Pizza|pizza]] before it is [[Baked|baked]].\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Italian recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:Pork recipes]]\n[[Category:Pizza recipes]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n[[Category:Pan fried]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#pizza #meatballs #oliveoil #sausages #pizzadough #pizzastone #pizzas #cheese #mozzarellacheese #sausagemeatballpizza #panfried </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
