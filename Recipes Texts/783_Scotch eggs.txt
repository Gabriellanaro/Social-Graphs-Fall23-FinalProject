[[Panko]] breadcrumbs work well. For this batch I used a mixture of black & white [[Poppy seeds|poppy seeds]]. [[Sesame seeds|sesame seeds]] are very good too.\n\nAfter trying many varieties of [[Sausages|sausages]] I have found the nicest tasting were Morrisons own brand sausages.  They are also economical [from 97p to \u00a31.65 for 454 grams - March 2018] Another advantage of these is that the [[Sausagemeat|sausagemeat]] is really easy to extract from the sausages because the skins are so loose on the [[Uncooked|uncooked]] sausages.\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| 2 packs of Morrisons own brand [[Sausages|sausages]] [454 g per pack]\n| 8 medium [[Free range eggs|free range eggs]] - ensure the [[Eggs|eggs]] are at least 4 days old or you will be unable to peel them easily.\n| Optional flavourings and coatings\n}}\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n\n* Add the [[Eggs|eggs]] to a pan of warm water and bring to the [[Boil|boil]] and boil for 5 minutes.  Remove the pan from the heat and allow to cool.\n* Peel the [[Hard-boiled eggs|hard-boiled eggs]] using a teaspoon.  Doing this under a trickle of water sometimes makes the task a little easier.\n* Preheat your [[Oven|oven]] to 180\u00b0 C (350\u00b0 F - gas 4), [fan oven 160\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Sesame poppy seed Scotch eggs recipe.jpg|Sesame seed and poppy seed Scotch eggs, cooked\nImage:Poppy seeds and Sesame seed Scotch eggs - ready to cook.jpg|Sesame seed and poppy seed Scotch eggs, ready to cook\nImage:Morrisons own brand sausages.jpg|Morrisons ''own brand'' sausages - my favourite!\n</gallery>\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| Squeeze the [[Sausagemeat|sausagemeat]] from 16 raw [[Sausages|sausages]] into a bowl.\n| If you are going to add any flavourings to the [[Sausage meat|sausage meat]], do this now.\n| Using your hands - latex gloves make this easier - squidge the [[Sausage meat|sausage meat]] together so it's mixed well.  Especially if your using a mixture of [[Sausages|sausages]].\n| Weigh out about 110g of [[Sausage meat|sausage meat]] and make a round pattie - about 13 cm [5 inches] in diameter.\n| Place a [[Hard-boiled egg|hard-boiled egg]] in the centre of the pattie and work it into a ball, ensuring there is no ''seam''.\n| If you are going to coat them, sprinkle your coating onto a large plate and roll the [[Scotch|scotch]] [[Eggs|eggs]] around in the mixture until they are completely covered.\n| Place the [[Eggs|eggs]] on o non-stick [[Baking tray|baking tray]] or a [[Baking|baking]] tray covered with [[Grease-proof paper|grease-proof paper]].\n| [[Bake]] in the [[Oven|oven]] for 40 minutes, turning once.\n| Allow to cool and serve.\n}}\n===Variations===\nTry coating with [[Breadcrumbs|breadcrumbs]], [[Poppy seeds|poppy seeds]] or [[Sesame seeds|sesame seeds]].\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Snacks and light bites]]\n[[Category:Starters]]\n[[Category:Beef recipes]]\n[[Category:Egg recipes]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:Pork recipes]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#scotcheggs #eggs #sausagemeat #sausages #scotch #sesameseeds #poppyseeds #bake #bakingtray #panko #boil </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
