You only need to cook it at the right temperature to get it to the required doneness and it will never be overdone.  Another advantage to this method is that the [[Meat|meat]] will be cooked evenly throughout.\n\nOne of the points of this recipe is to demonstrate that you can cook food at different temperatures without using two or three separate water baths.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| 2 large [[Baking|baking]] [[Potatoes|potatoes]], peeled and sliced (up to 50mm thick)\n| [[Salt]] and [[Pepper|pepper]]\n| 2 tablespoons [[Unsalted butter|unsalted butter]], softened\n| 4 [[sirloin steaks]]\n| 1/2 a teaspoon of [[Garlic powder]]\n| 1/2 a teaspoon of [[Onion]] powder\n| A further 60g [[Unsalted butter|unsalted butter]]\n| [[Olive oil]]\n}}\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n\n* Preheat your water bath to 84\u00b0C.\n\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| Pat the [[Potato|potato]] slices dry and season them lightly with [[Salt|salt]] and [[Pepper|pepper]].\n| Place them in a large pouch - they can overlap - and rub them with the [[Butter|butter]].\n| If you get any [[Butter|butter]] near the top of the pouch, wipe thoroughly, or it will not seal properly.\n| Place in the water bath and cook for 1 hour.\n| At the end of this time, reduce the water temperature to 56.5\u00b0C (''133.7\u00b0F'') for a medium-rare [[Steak|steak]] - see 'Variations' below for rare, well done etc.\n| The quickest way to reduce the temperature is to add cold water, removing some of the hot water with the aid of a jug if necessary.\n| In the meantime, sprinkle the steaks with [[Pepper|pepper]], [[Garlic powder|garlic powder]] and [[Onion|onion]] powder - the two latter ingredients are often slightly [[Salt|salt]]y, so additional [[Salt|salt]] may not be necessary.\n| Place in separate vacuum bags, and smear 15g [[Butter|butter]] over each [[Steak|steak]], again wiping the top of the pouch if it comes in contact with the [[Butter|butter]].\n| Keeping the [[Potato|potato]] slices in the water bath, add the sealed pouches once the correct temperature has been reached - the [[Potatoes|potatoes]] will not cook any more but will just be kept warm.\n| Cook the steaks for 1-4 hours for steaks of 25 mm thickness or 2-4 hours for 50mm steaks.\n| Cut open the pouches containing the steaks and [[Sear|sear]] for 1 minute each side in a very hot [[Frying pan|frying pan]] with a little [[Oil|oil]]. \n| Allow the steaks to [[Rest for|rest for]] a few minutes before serving with the [[Potatoes|potatoes]].\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe with [[Salad|salad]] or leafy [[Vegetables|vegetables]].\n===Variations===\nYou can use [[rib-eye steak]]s or [[Filet mignon|filet mignon]] if desired.  If you like your [[Steak|steak]] rare, the water bath should be heated to 49\u00b0C (''120.2\u00b0F''), medium 60\u00b0C (''140\u00b0F''), medium-well 65.5\u00b0C (''149.9\u00b0F'') or well done 71\u00b0C (''159.8\u00b0F'').\n{{SousVideSeeAlso}}\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Beef recipes]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:Potato recipes]]\n[[Category:Sous vide recipes]]\n[[Category:Sous vide cooking]]\n[[Category:Molecular gastronomy recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#butter #steak #potatoes #onion #potato #unsaltedbutter #garlicpowder #moleculargastronomyrecipes #oliveoil #sirloinsteakwithbutterypotatoessv #filetmignon </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
