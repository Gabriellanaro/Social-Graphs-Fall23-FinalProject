It needs to be cooked very slowly in some sort of liquid, other wise it will become tough and dry.\n\nThis recipe is cooked in a [[Slow cooker|slow cooker]], but can just as easily be adapted for cooking on the hob or in a low oven or even a [[pressure cooker]].\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 800g joint of [[Beef|beef]] silverside\n| 2 tablespoons [[Oil|oil]]\n| 3 medium [[Carrots|carrots]], peeled and sliced\n| 2 sticks of [[Celery|celery]], coarsely chopped\n| A handful of [[Dried|dried]] [[shiitake mushrooms]]\n| 500ml hot [[Beef Stock|beef stock]]\n| 300ml robust [[Red wine|red wine]]\n| 2 bulbs [[Garlic|garlic]], peeled\n| 1 large [[Onion|onion]], sliced\n| 2 tablespoons [[Tomato|tomato]] puree\n| 3 tablespoons [[Worcestershire sauce]]\n| 2 teaspoons dried [[oregano]]\n\n}}\n\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n* Preheat the [[Slow cooker|slow cooker]] for a few minutes.\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Heat the [[Oil|oil]] in a [[Frying pan|frying pan]] and [[Sear|sear]] the [[Meat|meat]] for about 3 minutes on each side.\n| Meanwhile, make a bed with the [[Carrots|carrots]] and [[Celery|celery]] on the bottom of the [[Slow cooker|slow cooker]].\n| Place the [[Seared|seared]] [[Meat|meat]] on top of the [[Vegetables|vegetables]] and add the [[shiitake mushrooms]].\n| Pour the [[Stock|stock]] and [[Wine|wine]] over the [[Meat|meat]], cover and set to 'low'.\n| After 2 hours, add the [[Garlic|garlic]], [[Onion|onion]], [[Tomato|tomato]] pur\u00e9e, [[oregano]] and [[Worcestershire sauce]].\n| Continue cooking for 5 hours.\n| Remove the silverside from the [[Slow cooker|slow cooker]] and allow to rest, under tented [[Foil|foil]] for 15 minutes.\n| Meanwhile, blend the [[Stock|stock]] and [[Vegetables|vegetables]] until smooth, to make a [[Gravy|gravy]].  You may need to thicken the gravy with a little [[cornflour]] or [[arrowroot]].\n| Slice the silverside, reheat the [[Gravy|gravy]] and serve.\n}}\n==See also==\n\n===Chef's notes===\nLast time we made this, there was lots of leftover gravy. So we froze the surplus [[stock]] in 150ml plastic coffee cups and then vacuum packed them as little [[stock]] lollies.  These have proved to be a highly useful and delicious [[stock]] base.
