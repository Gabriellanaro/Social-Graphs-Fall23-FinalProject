The [[Potatoes|potatoes]] are in fact optional, they\u2019re there more as a garnish than an [[Accompaniment|accompaniment]]. Any left over coleslaw and apple pickle will go very well in a [[Cheese|cheese]] sarnie\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n}}\n====roast pork====\n{{RecipeIngredientsNB\n| 1 kg [[Pork belly|pork belly]] \u2013 a good lean cut, but with skin on \n| 2 medium [[Onions|onions]] cut into thick slices \n| 16 or so small [[New Potatoes|new potatoes]], halved\n}}\n====pickled apples====\n{{RecipeIngredientsNB\n| 2 sweet crisp [[Apples|apples]], peeled, cored and cut into 1cm chunks \n| 250ml [[Cider vinegar|cider vinegar]] or a mix of 125ml [[Cider|cider]] [[Vinegar|vinegar]] and 125ml [[Apple|apple]] vinegar if you can get it \n| 250ml water \n| 60g soft [[Brown sugar|brown sugar]] \n| 1 [[Star anise|star anise]] \n| 1 tablespoon chopped [[Dill|dill]] stalks \n| 1 tablespoon finely chopped [[Dill|dill]] leaves \n| \u00bd teaspoons [[Salt|salt]] \n| \u00bd teaspoon [[Ground ginger|ground ginger]]\n}}\n====kohlrabi coleslaw====\n{{RecipeIngredientsNB\n| Half a head of [[Chinese cabbage]], cut into 4 segments and cored, then [[Shredded|shredded]] as finely as you can \n| Half a [[Kohlrabi|kohlrabi]], coarsely [[Grated|grated]] \n| 1 pack [[Dill|dill]], chopped finely, including all but the coarsest stalks (they can be used in the [[Pickling|pickling]] [[Liquor|liquor]] above)\n| 4 tablespoons of homemade [[Mayonnaise|mayonnaise]]\n| [[Salt]] and [[Pepper|pepper]] to taste \n| Half a head of [[Fennel|fennel]], cored and very finely sliced. Hang on to the feathery leaves for a garnish \n| [[Ground nut]] [[Oil|oil]]\n| [[Salt]] and [[Pepper|pepper]]\n}}\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n\n* 250\u00b0 C (475\u00b0 F - gas 9), [fan [[Oven|oven]] 230\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]\n\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| Pack the [[Onion|onion]] and [[Potatoes|potatoes]] onto the bottom of your [[Roasting tin|roasting tin]] to create a platform for the [[Meat|meat]]. Score the skin of the [[Pork belly|pork belly]] to create a 1cm grid all over, about 5 mm deep. Rub with [[Groundnut oil|groundnut oil]] and [[Salt|salt]], and place it on top of the veggies, skin side up. Turn your [[Oven|oven]] on to 240C, then put the [[Roasting|roasting]] tin in and cook for 20-25 minutes or so until the skin is [[Browned|browned]] all over. Turn the oven down to 160\u00b0 C (325\u00b0 F - gas 3), [fan oven 140\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour] and add a little [[Boiling|boiling]] water to the roasting tin to stop the veggies from burning. Continue cooking for a further 2 hours adding a little boiling water every half hour or so if necessary \n| Once cooked, remove the [[Pork|pork]] from the [[Roasting tin|roasting tin]] and allow it to [[Rest|rest]]. Using a [[Slotted spoon|slotted spoon]], remove the [[Potatoes|potatoes]] and [[Onions|onions]] and keep warm. Separate the [[Meat|meat]] from the [[Crackling|crackling]]; if you have a cook\u2019s [[Blow torch|blow torch]] this is a good time to give the [[Pork crackling|pork crackling]] a quick blast of heat to ensure that it is really crisp. \n}}\n====Meanwhile, prepare the Pickle Apples:- ====\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Fill a 1 litre jar with [[Apple|apple]] chunks and chopped [[Dill|dill]] leaves \n| Combine [[Vinegar|vinegar]] with water, chopped [[Dill|dill]] stalks, [[Sugar|sugar]], [[Salt|salt]] and [[Ginger|ginger]] in a medium [[Saucepan|saucepan]], and bring to a [[Boil|boil]]. [[Simmer]] for 5 minutes, stirring, making sure all the sugar dissolves. [[Sieve]] the hot mixture over the [[Apple|apple]] chunks, close the lid and [[Refrigerate|refrigerate]], preferably overnight. It will keep for up to two weeks \n}}\n====The Coleslaw:- ====\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Put the [[Cabbage|cabbage]], [[Kohlrabi|kohlrabi]] and [[Dill|dill]] leaves into a large bowl. Gently stir in 2 tablespoons of [[Mayonnaise|mayonnaise]]. If it needs some more, add one more. Season, put in a lunchbox, keep in the [[Fridge|fridge]]. It\u2019ll last about 4 days \n| With half an hour to go, put the [[Fennel|fennel]] slices into a bowl, and cover with water. Set your timer for 30 mins \n| Once the [[Pork|pork]] is done, take it out of the [[Oven|oven]]. Take it off the veggies, and set them aside on [[Kitchen paper|kitchen paper]]. Carefully take the [[Crackling|crackling]] off the pork, and cut it into four quarters. Shred the [[Rest|rest]] of the pork. Drain the [[Fennel|fennel]]\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nPlace a neat heap of [[Coleslaw|coleslaw]] in the centre of each plate. Scatter some [[Fennel|fennel]] slices around it, and arrange some [[Potato|potato]] halves too, if you fancy using them. Put a neat heap of [[Shredded|shredded]] [[Pork|pork]] on top of the coleslaw. Place a piece of [[Crackling|crackling]] on top, put a couple of little heaps of [[Pickled|pickled]] [[Apples|apples]] around too, garnish with fennel leaves and serve\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Pickles and preserves]]\n[[Category:Fruit recipes]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:Pork recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegetable recipes]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n[[Category:Nik and Edwina's Cookbook recipes]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n[[Category:Recipes from other sites]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#dill #fennel #pork #apple #kohlrabi #crackling #potatoes #coleslaw #shredded #slowroastedporkbellywithkohlrabicoleslawpickledappleandfennel #roastingtin </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
