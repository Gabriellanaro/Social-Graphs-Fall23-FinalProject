It was an absolute success, the [[grapefruit]] pairs so well with the [[mackerel]], cutting through what can a rather oily fish.\n\nThis recipe is very similar to a basic South American [[ceviche]].\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 320 g (11 oz) peppered or plain, ready-to-eat smoked [[Mackerel|mackerel]] fillets, skinned and flaked\n| 380 g 85 g (13.5 oz) cooked new potatoes, skin on, chopped into bite-sized pieces\n| 1 small [[Grapefruit|grapefruit]]\n| 1 100 g (3 &frac12; oz) pack prepared [[Salad|salad]] leaves\n}}\n'''For the [[Herb|herb]] dressing'''\n* 2 tablespoons [[Olive oil|olive oil]]\n* 1 tablespoon clear [[Honey|honey]]\n* 1 tablespoon [[White wine vinegar|white wine vinegar]]\n* 1 tablespoon [[dark soy sauce]]\n* A handful of [[Spring onions|spring onions]], finely [[Chopped on the diagonal|chopped on the diagonal]] or 1 small [[onion|red or white onion]], peeled and finely chopped \n* [[Sea Salt|sea salt]]\n\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Add the dressing ingredients to a large serving bowl\n| Cut the skin from the grapefruit and discard\n| Halve the  skinned grapefruit over the serving bowl and using your fingers, try to scoop the flesh from the grapefruit, leaving the membranes behind.
