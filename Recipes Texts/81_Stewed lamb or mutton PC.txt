It is trivial to thicken a stock at the end on the cooking process just by adding a few tablespoons of cornflour mixed with cold water , stir in, bring to the boil and then simmer vigorously for a few minutes.  As the vegetables in this recipe are going to be pur\u00e9ed at the end, there is no risk that overcooking will mush them. I'm going to cook this for a few hours so the meat just falls from the [[bones]].\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 2 tablespoons olive oil\n| 10 [[Peppercorns|peppercorns]]\n| 2 medium [[Carrots|carrots]], peeled and finely [[Diced|diced]]\n| 1 [[Parsnips|parsnip]], peeled and finely [[Diced|diced]]\n| 2 sticks of [[Celery|celery]], finely [[Diced|diced]]\n| Leaves from the [[celery]], finely chopped\n| 1 [[Onion|onion]], peeled and chopped\n| Crushed [[garlic]] (to taste)\n| 1 red pepper, de-seeded and cut into chunks\n| 1 tablespoon [[Sugar|sugar]]\n| 1 tablespoon of [[paprika powder]]\n| 1 [[Bay leaf|bay leaf]]\n| 1 teaspoon powdered [[Ginger|ginger]]\n| 1 kg [[Shoulder|shoulder]] of [[Mutton|mutton]] on the bone.\n| 500 ml hot [[Meat stock|meat stock]], or enough to cover the meat\n| 45 ml [[Sour cream|sour cream]]\n| 30 ml [[Red wine|red wine]]\n| 1 tablespoon of cornflour\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Add the olive oil and peppercorns to the [[pressure cooker]] and saut\u00e9 the [[Vegetables|vegetables]] until the [[Onion|onion]] is soft, but not [[Browned|browned]].\n| Add th [[Sugar|sugar]] and stir until it begins to change colour.\n| Add the [[Bay leaf|bay leaf]], [[Spices|spices]] and the [[lamb]], with just enough [[Stock|stock]] to cover. ''I had to cut the lamb shoulder joint in two so if would fit properly''.\nCover, bring up to full pressure (15 psi) and cook for 2 hours.   \n| Lower the pressure using the [[De-pressurising_a_pressure_cooker#Natural_release|natural release method]]\n| Remove the [[meat]] from the [[pressure cooker]], cover with [[tin-foil]] to keep warm.\n| Using a [[stick blender]] or [[food processor]] blend the stock. Alternatively it can be passed through a [[Sieve|sieve]].\n| Mix the cornflour to a paste with a tablespoon of cold water and stir into the stock\n| Bring the stock to the boil, simmer and stir for a few minutes until it thickens. \n| Mix in the [[Cream|cream]] and [[Red wine|red wine]].\n| Pour over the [[Meat|meat]].\n}}\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Stewed lamb or mutton before cream.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Meat removed, showing sauce before cream is added\nImage:Stewed lamb or mutton (PC).jpg|thumb|300px|right|The basic ingredients\n</gallery>\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe with [[boiled potatoes]] and [[vegetables]].\n===Chef's notes===\nI used a [[food processor]] to chop all of the vegetables before saut\u00e9ing them.\n\nI also added a big handful of [[blanched]] and peeled [[baby tomatoes]] with the meat as they were going spare.\n\nI personally find lamb quite fatty so It might have been an idea to remove some of the fat before adding the cream.  However that would have meant allowing the stock to cool a little first.\n{{Template:PeelingGinger}}\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes|Lamb]]\n[[Category:Austrian recipes|Lamb]]\n[[Category:Main courses|Lamb]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes|Lamb]]\n[[Category:Mutton recipes|Lamb]]\n[[Category:Lamb recipes|Lamb]]\n[[Category:Stews and casseroles|Lamb]]\n[[Category:Cooking with wine|Lamb]]\n[[Category:Pressure cooker recipes|Lamb]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#pressurecooker #diced #celery #vegetables #foodprocessor #bayleaf #redwine #onion #meatstock #cream #stickblender </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
