The only other flavouring is a good pinch of [[Black pepper|black pepper]].  Don't add any [[Salt|salt]] as this would just dehydrate the steak as it cooks.\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| 1 370 g [[Rib-eye Steak|rib-eye steak]]\n| 4 slices of [[Onion|onion]]\n| 4 small slices of [[Red pepper|red pepper]]\n| 4 large [[Bay leaves|bay leaves]]\n| A good pinch of [[Black pepper|black pepper]]\n}}\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Sous vide at 62\u00b0 C for 10 hours.jpg|Cook sous vide at 62\u00b0 C for 10 hours\nImage:Rib-eye steak onion sage and red pepper sealed.jpg|Rib-eye steak onion sage and red pepper sealed\nImage:Rib-eye steak onion sage and red pepper ready.jpg|Rib-eye steak onion sage and red pepper\n</gallery>\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| Sprinkle the steaks with a good pinch of [[Black pepper|black pepper]] - no [[Salt|salt]]!\n| Layer the [[Onion|onion]] slices, [[Red pepper|red pepper]] and [[Sage leaves|sage leaves]] over either side of the steaks.\n| [[Vacuum seal]] the [[Steak|steak]] in a [[Sous-vide|sous-vide]] bag\n| Cook [[Sous-vide|sous-vide]] for 10 hours at 62\u00b0 C [143\u00b0 F]\n| Remove the [[Steak|steak]] from the bag\n| Reserve the juices if you want to make [[Gravy|gravy]] from them\n| Discard the [[Onion|onion]], [[Pepper|pepper]] and [[Sage leaves|sage leaves]]\n| Quickly [[Sear|sear]] the steaks for a minute on each side in a hot, lightly oiled [[Frying pan|frying pan]] or with a [[Blowtorch|blowtorch]]\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe with [[Chips|chips]], [[Tomatoes|tomatoes]] and a little [[Salad|salad]].\n===Chef's notes===\nBy all means cook 2 separate steaks, in 2 sous-vide bags.\n\n[[Air fried]] [[Chips|chips]] are best with this!\n\nThis was very nice, looked well-done but tasted rare.
