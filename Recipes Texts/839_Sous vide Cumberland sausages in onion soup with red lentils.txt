Cooked at 71\u00b0C (''159.8\u00b0F''), the [[Lentils|lentils]] would still not be properly cooked so I [[Boiled|boiled]] them for 10 minutes first.  Different lentils may need longer cooking.\n\nI've used Debbie & Andrew's Cumberland [[Sausages|sausages]], but any good quality would do.\n\nI found the Heinz [[Onion|onion]] [[Soup|soup]] to be too sweet for my test so I would try an alternative next time.  A total success nonetheless.\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| 1 pack (6) [[Debbie and Andrew's Butcher's Classic Cumberland Sausages]]\n| 140 g [[Dried|dried]] [[Red lentils|red lentils]]\n| 1 small [[Red onion|red onion]], peeled and finely chopped\n| 4 [[Cloves of garlic|cloves of garlic]], peeled, smashed and chopped\n| Pinch of [[Freshly ground black pepper|freshly ground black pepper]]\n| 1 can [[French]] [[Onion]] [[Soup|soup]]\n}}\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n\n* Pop the [[Sous vide bath|sous vide bath]] on to preheat to 71\u00b0C (''159.8\u00b0F'')\n\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| Rinse the [[Lentils|lentils]] in cold running water then [[Boil|boil]] for 10 minutes, skim and discard any scum. , test them before bagging up as they won't get much softer being cooked [[Sous-vide|sous-vide]].\n| Drain them in a [[Sieve|sieve]].\n| Toss the [[Sausages|sausages]], [[Onion|onion]] and [[Garlic|garlic]] in a hot pan just enough to colour the sausages.

If using the [[Andrew James Professional Quality Vacuum Food Sealer Machine]]: [[Vacuum seal]], then cancel, then manually seal, allows you to vacuum seal a liquid without drawing it all into the vacuum chamber.\n| Cook in a [[Sous vide bath|sous vide bath]] for 8 hours at 71\u00b0C (''159.8\u00b0F'')\n}}\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Sous vide sausages lentils onion soup ingredients.jpg|300px|thumb|right|Simple ingredients\nImage:Sous vide sausages lentils onion soup bagged up.jpg|300px|thumb|right|Vacuum sealed, ready for the bath\n</gallery>\n===Serving suggestions===\nThis went nicely with crusty [[Bread|bread]] to [[Dip|dip]] with.\n===Variations===\nYou could cook this in a [[Slow cooker|slow cooker]] on low for about 4 hours.\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Soup and stock recipes]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:Pork recipes]]\n[[Category:Slow cooker recipes]]\n[[Category:Sous vide recipes]]\n[[Category:Debbie&andrew's sausage recipes]]\n[[Category:Pan fried]]\n[[Category:Sous vide cooking]]\n[[Category:Boiled or simmered]]\n[[Category:Favourite recipes]]\n{{Template:Sous Vide, Smoking and Curing UK}}\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#onion #lentils #soup #sausages #slowcooker #sousvidebath #sousvide #sousvidecumberlandsausagesinonionsoupwithredlentils #boil #clovesofgarlic #redlentils </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
