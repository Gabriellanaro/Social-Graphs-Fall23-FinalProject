Very ''[[Chinese]]''!\n[[Image:Sous vide duck pizza alt.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Sous vide hoisin duck pizza, ready to bake]]\n\nWe used the [[Gressingham duck breast portions]] which are quite small at 125g each and also end up quite wet.  Fresh duck breast is quite dry and firm.  Still an exceptionally good pizza. \n\n'''for the sous vide duck breasts'''\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 1 pack [[Gressingham duck breast portions]] (2 x 125g duck breasts)\n| 1 tablespoon hoisin sauce \n}}\n\n'''for the pizza'''\n{{RecipeIngredientsNB\n| 1 portion [[pizza dough]]\n| 30 ml [[Hoisin sauce|hoisin sauce]]\n| 1 portion [[Pizza dough|pizza dough]]\n| 2 sliced sous vide duck breasts\n| 8 [[cherry tomatoes]]\n| 2 balls of [[Mozzarella cheese|mozzarella cheese]]\n| [[Sea salt]]\n| Freshly ground [[black pepper]]\n| 2 teaspoons [[Chilli oil]]\n}}\n\n===[[Mise en place]]===\nIf using a pizza stone, preheat the pizza stone under a very hot grill for about 20 minutes. Place it about 8cm (3\") from the heat source.\n\nIf using the oven, preheat it to 220\u00b0 C (425\u00b0 F - gas 7)\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| [[Vacuum seal]] the [[Duck|duck]] breasts together with 1 tablespoon easpoon of [[Hoisin sauce|hoisin sauce]]\n| Cook in a [[Sous vide bath|sous vide bath]] for 3 hours at 61\u00b0C [141\u00b0F]\n| Remove from the vacuum bag, discarding the [[Sauce|sauce]], it will have done its job and flavoured the [[Meat|meat]].\n| Slice the duck breast and lay on a paper towel to remove any excess water - these packaged duck breasts seem to be pumped full of water\n| Dust your work surface with [[Fine yellow cornmeal|fine yellow cornmeal]]\n| Divide the [[Pizza dough|pizza dough]] into two and roll out into two thin 25.5 cm (10 inch) [[Pizzas|pizzas]]\n| You can leave them in a [[Warm place|warm place]] for an hour or so to rise. I quite like them cooked immediately they are rolled out for a more crispy finish.\n| Prick the [[Pizza|pizza]] all over with a fork. This prevents it puffing up too much and burning while it is cooking\n| With a deft move, slide the [[Pizza|pizza]] from the [[Pizza peel|pizza peel]], on to the preheated [[Pizza stone|pizza stone]].\n| Cook on one side only for about 2 minutes or until lightly [[Browned|browned]].\n| Repeat for the other side.\n| Remove from the [[Oven|oven]] and cover the pizza base with a good drizzle of [[hoisin sauce]]\n| Crumble a ball of [[mozzarella]] cheese over the pizza\n| Top with the sliced duck and 4 halved [[cherry tomatoes]]\n| Season with salt, pepper a drizzle of [[chilli oil]]olive\n| Return to the [[Oven|oven]] and bake until the [[Cheese|cheese]] is nicely melted. This should take about 4 minutes under a grill on a pizza stone, if oven baking, about 15 minutes in the middle of the oven.\n| Repeat for the second [[Pizza|pizza]].\n| Keep the first [[Pizza|pizza]] warm at the bottom of the [[Oven|oven]] whilst you make the second.\n}}\nOnce the pizzas had been cooked a lot of water was released from the duck.  I just mopped this up with a [[paper towel]] and the pizza was still fabulous.  Fresh duck breasts would not do this.\n===See also===\n*[[Sous vide duck pizza]]\n* [[Crispy duck and hoisin pizza]], similar but with tomato topping\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Italian recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Snacks and light bites]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:Poultry recipes]]\n[[Category:Pizza recipes]]\n[[Category:Favourite recipes]]\n[[Category:Sous vide recipes]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n[[Category:Sous vide cooking]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#hoisinsauce #pizza #pizzadough #pizzas #chillioil #cherrytomatoes #sousvidecooking #mozzarellacheese #sousvide #sauce #warmplace </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
