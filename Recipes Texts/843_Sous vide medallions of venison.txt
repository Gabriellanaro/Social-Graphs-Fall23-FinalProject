Game - Sussex Smokers]] on their first visit to [[Hall Place Farmers' Market, Bexley, Kent]].\n\nI thought they might be nice, simply cooked [[Sous vide|sous vide]] in just [[Salt|salt]], [[Pepper|pepper]], [[Butter|butter]] and a [[Bay leaf|bay leaf]].\n\nFrom the experiments I have done when [[Sous vide cooking|sous vide cooking]], I've found if the temperature is kept relatively low the cooking period does not seem to be so important.  In fact, I would say that the longer it is cooked, the more tender the [[Meat|meat]].  Rather like [[Slow cooking|slow cooking]], the extended cooking time helps to break down the collagens into a nice [[Sauce|sauce]].\n\nBecause the [[Meat|meat]] is [[Vacuum sealed|vacuum sealed]], the meat is never dry, even after 3 hours of cooking.\n\nCompared to normal [[Meat|meat]] cooking when a rare [[Steak|steak]] can be bloody and not tender, even meat cooked [[Sous vide|sous vide]] to medium well done still has the moisture and mouthfeel of a rare steak, but without the blood. I'm going for 58.5\u00b0C for 3 hours.\n===Ingredients===\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| 2 [[Venison|venison]] ([[Deer|deer]]) medallions - about 140 g each\n| 2 [[Bay leaves|bay leaves]]\n| 2 tablespoons of [[Butter|butter]]\n| [[Salt]] and [[Freshly ground black pepper|freshly ground black pepper]]\n}}\n\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| Stamp the medallions with a [[Meat tenderiser|meat tenderiser]] if you have one.\n| Pat the medallions dry, dress with a pinch of [[Salt|salt]] and freshly [[Ground|ground]] black  [[Pepper|pepper]], add a knob of [[Butter|butter]] and a [[Bay leaf|bay leaf]] and then [[Vacuum seal|vacuum seal]].\n| Cook in a [[Sous vide bath|sous vide bath]] at 56.5\u00b0C (''133.7\u00b0F'') for 3 hours\n| Remove from the vacuum pouch, reserving the juices to add to the gravy.  I used them to make a mushroom sauce.\n| [[Sear]] in a hot pan to finish, ideally with a [[Blowtorch|blowtorch]].\n| Serve immediately.  (Unlike conventionally cooked [[Meat|meat]], I've never found a benefit to [[Resting meat|resting meat]] cooked [[Sous vide|sous vide]])\n}}\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Venison Deer medallion vacuum sealed.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Vacuum sealed\nImage:Venison Deer medallions meat tendersier.jpg|thumb|300px|right|[[Meat tenderiser]] with the ingredients\n</gallery>\n===Chef's note===\nThe medallions were moist and had a really tender mouthfeel, taste and texture almost like liver.  Very nice.\n\nI'm sure some cuts of venison may take a lot longer to cook, but these were selected cuts and very tender to start with.\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Game recipes]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:Sous vide recipes]]\n[[Category:Sous vide cooking]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#butter #sousvide #meattenderiser #sousvidecooking #bayleaf #venison #sousvidebath #sousvidemedallionsofvenison #vacuumsealed #vacuumseal #restingmeat </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
