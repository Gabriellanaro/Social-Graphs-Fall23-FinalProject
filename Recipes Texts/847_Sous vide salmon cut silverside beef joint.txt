Much appreciated as a relative newcomer to the whole sous vide experience.''\n\n''I love experimenting and found your article extremely helpful.''\n\n''I went one better, I hope, at least, in some respect.  Keeping it simple I bought a 2.5 kg  Silverside beef joint from tesco in St Helens whilst at half price.  I followed the basic tenet that it's not weight but thickness that counts.  My silverside salmon cut(ish) joint was probably 4 inches thick at its widest and not much wider than the joint in the recipe at leat I am basing this roughly on the pics provided.  Rather than vacuum seal it I cooked it in a ziploc bag overnight. When i got up it had been cooking for 8 hours and had reached an internal temp of 58C.  I resealed the bag and cooked it for the extra 2 hours as advised. I got home a bit late, approx 30 mins. Temp at this point was still 58 degrees, but not as tough, I assumed, allowing for cooling, when the thermometer probe was pushed into the meat. Chilled in fridge over next 6 hours, no rapid  chilling  !!''\n\n''Meat on slicing was cooked to medium doneness and stock made a lovely gravy with mushrooms and onion.''\n\n''In reality I also prefer a medium rare cut but the wife is not a big beef lover, hence my attempt to please.  As it happens, she didn't appreciate it and left the meat, but she tried to please.''\n\n''So, as the original author suggested, a lower temp may well be required and adviseable for a medium rare doneness.''\n\n'''Mark Thompson - March 2018'''\n{{SousVideSeeAlso}}\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Beef recipes]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:Sous vide recipes]]\n[[Category:Sous vide cooking]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#beef #butter #salmon #englishmustard #sousvide #sousvidecooking #sousvidesalmoncutsilversidebeefjoint #roastpotatoes #rest #blowtorching #blowtorch </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
