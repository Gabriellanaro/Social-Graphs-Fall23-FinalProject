In this recipe it results in a crispy flavourful bird.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 1 medium-sized [[Chicken|chicken]], [[Parson's nose|parson's nose removed]]\n| 1 [[Lemon|lemon]], bruised and halved\n| 8 [[Cloves of garlic|cloves of garlic]], 4 peeled and crushed, 4 peeled, bashed and left whole\n| 1 large [[onion|onion]]\n| [[Olive oil|olive oil]]\n| [[Sea Salt|sea salt]] and freshly [[Ground|ground]] back [[Pepper|pepper]]\n| 2 tablespoons of [[plain flour]]\n\n}}\n\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n* Preheat the [[Oven|oven]] to 220\u00b0 C (425\u00b0 F - gas 7), [fan oven 200\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]\n\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Spatchcocked chicken, oven ready.jpg|Spatchcock chicken, ready for the oven\nImage:Spatchcocked chicken garlic rub.jpg|Rub the garlic/lemon oil over the bird\nImage:Spatchcock chicken fennel and onion bed.jpg|A bed of fennel, onions, garlic and lemon\nImage:Spatchcocked chicken with fennel and onions_ingredients.jpg|Spatchcocked chicken with fennel and onions, the ingredients\n</gallery>\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| [[Spatchcock]] the [[Chicken|chicken]] - [[Spatchcock|see here for details]]\n| Find a [[Roasting tray|roasting tray]] that is large enough to take the bird laid out flat\n| Peel and slice the [[Onions|onions]]\n| Slice the [[Fennel|fennel]] and roughly chop any green leaves\n| [[Oil]] the tray and layer the base with the [[Onions|onions]] and [[Fennel|fennel]]\n| Add the juice of the [[Lemon|lemon]] to the [[Crushed garlic|crushed garlic]], a glug of olive oil and a generous seasoning of [[Salt|salt]] and [[Pepper|pepper]] and rub this all over the bird\n| Lay the bird, skin-side-up in the tray and tuck the whole [[Garlic|garlic]] [[Cloves|cloves]] and [[Fennel|fennel]] leaves anywhere you can\n| Drizzle a little more [[olive oil]] over the bird, garnish with a final grind of [[black pepper]], cover with [[Tin-foil|tin-foil]], seal and [[Roast|roast]] for 30 minutes\n| Remove the [[Foil|foil]], [[Baste|baste]] the [[Chicken|chicken]] and [[Roast|roast]] uncovered for a further 30 to 45 minutes.\n| Remove the chicken to a warm plate and cover with foil\n| Heat the roasting tray on the hob, sprinkle 2 tablespoons of flour into the cooking juices and mix well to make delicious [[gravy]].  Heat until it thickens then serve.\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nAlmost anything would go with this.  [[Tex-Mex potato wedges]] and [[broccoli]] worked for us!\n===Chef's notes===\nIf you are not eating this in one sitting, store the remaining meat in a large [[Lock and Lock]] style box and refrigerate one cooled. This way you will have moist chicken the next day, not dried-out meat.\n==See also==\n* [[Spatchcock|How to spatchcock a chicken, step-by-step pictures]]\n* http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatchcock\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:French recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Garlic recipes]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:Poultry recipes]]\n[[Category:Stewed, braised or pot roasted]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#spatchcockedchickenwithfennelandonions #fennel #chicken #lemon #roast #onions #oliveoil #baste #blackpepper #gravy #roastingtray </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
