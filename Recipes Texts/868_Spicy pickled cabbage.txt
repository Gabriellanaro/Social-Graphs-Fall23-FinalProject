It needs to be fine so [[rock salt]] won't do.\n| 1 litre of [[Pickling|pickling]] [[Vinegar|vinegar]]\n| 1 tablespoon whole [[Coriander seeds|coriander seeds]]\n| 1 tablespoon whole [[Peppercorns|peppercorns]] \n| 1 tablespoon [[Chili flakes|chili flakes]]\n| 1 heaped tablespoon [[Ground ginger powder|ground ginger powder]]\n| 1 tablespoon [[Juniper berries|juniper berries]]\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Rinse and dry the outside of the cabbage \n| Peel and discard any floppy or damaged leaves\n| Cut into quarters, cut out the core and then cut into eight pieces.\n| Shred the [[Cabbage|cabbage]], preferably with a [[Food processor|food processor]] fitted with a slicing attachment\n| Pick through the shredded cabbage, remove and chop any large pieces by hand.\n| Split the [[Shredded|shredded]] [[Cabbage|cabbage]] between a couple of colanders and build up in layers; a layer of cabbage, a layer of [[Salt|salt]], a layer of cabbage, etc.\n| Place the colanders over plates and leave in a cool place for 24 hours\n| Meanwhile we'll [[Spice|spice]] up the [[Vinegar|vinegar]].\n| In a well ventilated kitchen, add the [[Vinegar|vinegar]] and the [[Spices|spices]] to a large pan and bring to the [[Boil|boil]]. [[Simmer]] gently for 10 minutes, then remove from the heat and allow to cool completely\n| When cold, pour into a jar and cover until the [[Cabbage|cabbage]] is ready\n| After 24 hours, rinse the [[Cabbage|cabbage]] under a cold tap to remove the [[Salt|salt]] and then squeeze out as much excess water as you can.  A [[salad-spinner]] would be good for this.\n| Leave to drain in the colanders whilst you strain the [[Vinegar|vinegar]] through a clean [[muslin]] cloth or a [[Tea|tea]]-towel.\n| Pack the [[Cabbage|cabbage]] into clean sterilised jars and cover with the [[vinegar]]\n| Seal and store in a cool dark place for up to 10 weeks.\n| It will be ready to eat after 1 week.\n}}\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Spicy pickled red cabbage salting.jpg|thumb|300px|right|1 of 2 colanders of the salting cabbage after just 15 minutes\nImage:Spicy pickled red cabbage ingredients.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The ingredients\n</gallery>\n===Chef's notes===\nIf you notice a musty smell from the cabbage before you cut it open, yet it appears perfect on the outside, cut it in half and check the core.  More than once I've had a little mould on the inside leaves around the core.  Discard them and wash the cabbage once it's been sliced if you are really paranoid. Do pat it dry on a tea-towel before salting.\n\n''This recipe makes exactly enough pickled cabbage to fill a two litre preserving jar''\n{{Template:PeelingGinger}}\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes|Pickled cabbage]]\n[[Category:Accompaniments|Pickled cabbage]]\n[[Category:Historic recipes|Pickled cabbage]]\n[[Category:Pickles and preserves|Pickled cabbage]]\n[[Category:Vegetable recipes|Pickled cabbage]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes|Pickled cabbage]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegan recipes]]\n[[Category:Pickled]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#vinegar #cabbage #spicypickledcabbage #spices #rocksalt #pickling #boil #juniperberries #cookingsalt #foodprocessor #shredded </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
