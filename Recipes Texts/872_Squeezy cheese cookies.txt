I can't abide sweet biscuits so it has to be something savoury.  This is it.\n\n'''Don't bother trying to use the cookie press with this recipe.''' I can't get this (or any other) recipe to work well in the [[Oxo Good Grips Cookie Press]].  The dough is either too hard to extrude properly or too liquid so ends up as a splodge on the baking tray.\n\nThis recipe works perfectly as cheese cookie recipe, but you'll need to hand cut the cookies manually.  I've made this recipe 4 times now and to my mind, the best cookies are very thin ones, 2 to 3 mm when cooked.  These have a nice crisp crunch.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| 150 g [5 oz - 1.5 cups] [[Plain flour|plain flour]]\n| &#188; teaspoon [[Chili powder|chili powder]]\n| &#188; teaspoon [[Smoked paprika powder|smoked paprika powder]]\n| &#189; teaspoon [[Sea Salt|sea salt]]\n| 60 g [2.5 oz] [[Butter|butter]] cut into small cubes\n| 225 g [1.5 lb] strong [[Cheddar cheese]], roughly [[Grated|grated]]\n}}\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n\n* Preheat your [[Oven|oven]] to 190\u00b0 C (375\u00b0 F - gas 5), [fan oven 170\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]\n* Ensure the [[Cheese|cheese]] and [[Butter|butter]] are at room temperature\n\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| Add the dry ingredients to a [[Food processor|food processor]] with a metal blade and pulse until combined.\n| Add the [[Butter|butter]] and [[Cheese|cheese]] and mix until it separates into small balls.
