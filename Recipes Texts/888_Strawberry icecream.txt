I think this is a nicer way to make an [[Ice cream|ice cream]] to suit everyones tastes.  Squeezy [[Chocolate sauce|chocolate sauce]], [[Honey|honey]] or [[Golden syrup|golden syrup]] can be drizzled over the ice-cream for those sweeter of tooth.\n\nThe maximum volume of my [[Ice-cream maker|ice-cream maker]] ''[[Cuisinart]] Professional [[Ice cream maker|ice cream maker]]'' is 1.5 [[Litres|litres]], which seems to fairly common.  This recipe makes more than this, but any leftover [[Ice cream|ice cream]] can be [[Popped|popped]] into a [[Lock and Lock box]] and [[Frozen|frozen]] immediately.  Just remove it from the [[Freezer|freezer]] an hour before you want to serve it.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| 460 g fresh [[Strawberries|strawberries]]\n| 600 ml [[Single Cream|single cream]]\n| 500 ml [[Greek yogurt]]\n| 40 ml freshly squeezed [[Lemon juice|lemon juice]]\n| 100 g [[Caster Sugar|caster sugar]]\n| [[Scant]] &#189; teaspoon of [[Vanilla extract|vanilla extract]]\n}}\n\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| Remove the stems (''peduncle'') from the [[Strawberries|strawberries]] and trim and discard any white unripe parts.\n| Add the [[Strawberries|strawberries]] and the remaining ingredients to a [[Food processor|food processor]] with a metal blade and [[Blend|blend]] to your desired consistency.\n| Pour unto your [[Ice-cream maker|ice-cream maker]] and follow your manufacturer's instructions. For mine it's just needs to run for one hour.\n| Pour any leftover mixture into a [[Lock and Lock]] style box and [[Freeze|freeze]].\n}}\n===Chef's notes===\nTo my palate, this tastes like a creamy sorbet as it has a fresh lemony tang.\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Sweets and desserts]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes]]\n[[Category:Ice-cream recipes]]\n[[Category:Frozen]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#strawberries #icecream #frozen #lemonjuice #icecreammaker #goldensyrup #sorbet #honey #greekyogurt #cuisinart #lockandlock </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
