I am making it to go with [[Tex-Mex beer can chicken]] as I feel they would work well together.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 450 g canned [[Sweetcorn|sweetcorn]]\n| 300 ml [[Vegetable Stock|vegetable stock]]\n| 60 g [[Dried|dried]] [[Couscous|couscous]]\n| 50 g [[Butter|butter]]\n| 1 teaspoon [[Chilli flakes|chilli flakes]]\n| 100g [[Spring onions|spring onions]], [[Sliced on the diagonal|sliced on the diagonal]]\n| 3 [[Sweet peppers|sweet peppers]], [[Roasted|roasted]], de-seeded and sliced.  A mix of colours is good.\n| 400g [[Borlotti beans|borlotti beans]]\n| 1 cup [[defrosted]] [[garden peas]]\n| [[Salt]] and [[Freshly ground black pepper|freshly ground black pepper]] to taste\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Place the [[Couscous|couscous]] in a small bowl, [[Boil|boil]] the [[Stock|stock]] and pour about &frac34; of it over the couscous. Leave for 15 minutes then fluff with a fork.\n| Rinse the [[Sweetcorn|sweetcorn]] and [[Beans|beans]] under running cold water.\n| Heat the [[Butter|butter]] in a large [[Frying pan|frying pan]] or [[Wok|wok]], add the [[Chilli flakes|chilli flakes]], a grind of [[Pepper|pepper]] and the [[Chopped spring onions|chopped spring onions]] and [[peppers]] and [[Stir-fry|stir-fry]] for a 20 seconds and then add the [[Sweetcorn|sweetcorn]], [[Pulses|pulses]] and the remaining [[Stock|stock]]\n| Bring to the [[Boil|boil]], reduce and [[Simmer|simmer]] until the [[stock]] has almost disappeared and the [[Vegetables|vegetables]] are heated, about 10 minutes.\n| Add the [[Couscous|couscous]], mix well and serve hot.\n}}\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Succotash (British ingredients) recipe.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Before the couscous\nImage:Succotash ingredients) recipe.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Succotash (British ingredients)\n</gallery>\n===Variations===\nI've used [[Borlotti beans|borlotti beans]] so there is a good colour mix, however almost any canned [[Pulses|pulses]] would be fine.  I often open various cans of pulses, rinse them, mix them all up in a huge bowl and [[Freeze|freeze]] in small batches.  A mix such as this would be ideal in this dish.\n==See also==\n* [[Succotash (Native American)]]\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Accompaniments]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Grain and bean recipes]]\n[[Category:Snacks and light bites]]\n[[Category:Vegetable recipes]]\n[[Category:Boiled or simmered]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#couscous #sweetcorn #stock #butter #chilliflakes #pulses #borlottibeans #boil #springonions #boiledorsimmered #vegetablestock </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
