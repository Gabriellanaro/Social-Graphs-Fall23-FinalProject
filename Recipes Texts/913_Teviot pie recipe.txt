Although the classic Teviot pie has a suet pastry crust, I prefer the more subtle texture and flavour of a suet crust made with a [[potato dumpling]] mix.\n\nGive it a try and see if you agree.\nIf you want to make this pie using the traditional method, '''''after''''' you have tried this recipe, you can always make it with a [[Steak and kidney pudding|pure suet crust]]. :-)\n\n'''pie filling'''\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 600g (1lb 5 oz) diced [[stewing]] steak, diced\n| A few tablespoons of [[plain flour]]\n| 284ml/ 1/2 pint of stock in total made with [[beef stock]] and including a dash of [[red wine]]\n| Splash of [[Worcestershire sauce]]\n| Salt and [[freshly ground black pepper]] to taste\n| Pinch of [[mustard]]\n| 1 large [[onion]], peeled and chopped\n| 2 tablespoons freshly chopped [[parsley]]\n| 2 tablespoons [[tomato pur\u00e9e]]\n}}\n'''suet crust'''\n{{RecipeIngredientsNB\n| 450g (1 lb) floury potatoes (Desiree, King Edward), peeled, boiled and mashed.  About two medium baking potatoes.\n| 110g (4 oz) suet\n| 110g (4 to 4&frac12; oz) self-raising flour\n| 1 heaped teaspoon of [[baking powder]]\n| Salt and pepper to taste\n\n}}\n\n===[[Mise en place]]===\nPreheat [[Oven|oven]] to 140\u00b0 C (275\u00b0 F - gas 1)\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Trim any excess [[fat]] from the [[steak]] and cut into bite-sized pieces\n| Season the [[flour]] with [[salt]] and pepper, place in a [[Lock and Lock]] style box together with the steak pieces, seal the lid and shake well to coat.\n| Layer the [[onion]], [[meat]] and [[parsley]] into a buttered pie dish\n| Mix the [[tomato pur\u00e9e]], [[beef stock]] and [[mustard]]\n| Pour the stock mixture into the dish so that the meat is about half covered.\n| Cover the pie dish with [[tin-foil]] so it is completely sealed and bake for about 3 hours.\n}}\n'''suet crust'''\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Mash the cooled [[potatoes]] into a large bowl and with you hands, rub in the [[suet]], [[flour]], seasoning and [[baking powder]].  If the resulting mixture is too wet, add a little more flour.\n| Store in a sealed container so it does not dry out and refrigerate whilst the pie filling slowly cooks.\n| After the filling has cooked for 3 hours, increase the oven temperature to 200\u00b0C (400\u00b0F - Gas\t6)\n| Check the suet mixture has not become too wet and correct using extra flour - the potatoes seem to release more moisture over time.\n| To prevent it sticking to the work surface, use [[yellow cornmeal]] if you have it, plain flour if not and roll out the [[suet]]. Carefully remove the tin-foil from the pie dish and and lay the crust on the pie filling.\n| [[Bake]] in the oven for 20 to 30 minutes until the [[suet]] crust has risen and is golden brown.\n}}\n===Chef's notes===\nIf you are pushed for time, you can cook this for less time at a higher temperature, however, the steak won't be as succulent and flavoursome.\n\nThe quick version: 220\u00b0 C (425\u00b0 F - Gas 7 - Hot) and follow the cooking instructions for [[Steak and kidney pie]] including the tin-foil tip.\n\nDon't be tempted to make the suet crust with a food processor, you will probably get a crust that does not rise.\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Beef recipes]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#suet #bakingpowder #parsley #flour #onion #beefstock #mustard #teviotpierecipe #worcestershiresauce #potatoes #potatodumpling </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
