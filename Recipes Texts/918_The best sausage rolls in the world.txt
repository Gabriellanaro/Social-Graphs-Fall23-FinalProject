What a superb success - how these are not in [[Delia]]'s cheat book I'll never know!\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 6 high quality [[Sausages|sausages]], preferably from your local butchers or farmers market\n| 1 375g [[Pre-rolled puff pastry|pre-rolled puff pastry]]\n\n}}\n\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n* Preheat the [[Oven|oven]] to 200\u00b0 C (400\u00b0 F - gas 6)\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Allow the [[Sausages|sausages]] and the [[Pastry|pastry]] about 30 minutes to get to room temperature\n| Unroll the [[Pastry|pastry]] and cut into lengths large enough to cover the [[Sausages|sausages]]\n| Roll [[Pastry|pastry]] around the [[Sausages|sausages]] - don't overlap too much\n| Cut a few slashes in the top\n| Place on a lightly greased [[baking tray]]\n| Bake until golden [[Brown|brown]] for about 30 minutes\n}}\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:The best sausage rolls in the world ready for baking.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Ready for baking\nImage:The best sausage rolls in the world simple ingredients.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Simple ingredients\n</gallery>\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe two of these with [[New Potatoes|new potatoes]] and [[Baked beans|baked beans]] for a superb meal.\n===Variations===\nIf you're not so keen on lots of [[Pastry|pastry]], cut it narrow and allow the [[Sausages|sausages]] to poke out of each end\n===Chef's notes===\nI thought that a [[Grill|grill]] mesh would be a good idea as it would allow air under the rolls.  It was not, the [[Pastry|pastry]] covers the grid and expands, making it impossible to remove them cleanly.  Use a greased [[baking tray]]!\n===Chef's notes===\n{{Template:ThinkPig}}\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes|Sausage rolls]]\n[[Category:Beef recipes|Sausage rolls]]\n[[Category:Bread and baking|Sausage rolls]]\n[[Category:Cookery cheats|Sausage rolls]]\n[[Category:British recipes|Sausage rolls]]\n[[Category:Main courses|Sausage rolls]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes|Sausage rolls]]\n[[Category:Pork recipes|Sausage rolls]]\n[[Category:Snacks and light bites|Sausage rolls]]\n[[Category:Student recipes|Sausage rolls]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#thebestsausagerollsintheworld #sausages #pastry #bakingtray #miseenplace #sausage #delia #newpotatoes #bakedbeans #grill </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
