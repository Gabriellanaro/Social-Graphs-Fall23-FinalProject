They are thick and therefore absorb less [[Oil|oil]] than thin ones.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 1.1 kg large [[Potatoes|potatoes]] - approx. (eg. King Edward, Maris Piper, Rooster or Sante) peeled and cut into thick [[Chips|chips]]\n| [[Salt]]\n| [[Sunflower]] or [[Peanut oil|peanut oil]] - follow your fryer's manufacturer's instructions as to quantity.\n\n}}\n\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n* Soak the [[Chips|chips]] in a pan of cold water for 45 minutes to remove excess [[Starch|starch]].\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Drain the soaked [[Chips|chips]] and bring to the [[Boil|boil]], with the [[Salt|salt]], in a pan of fresh cold water and cook for about 5-6 minutes.\n| Immediately, remove from heat, drain, return to the pan and rinse off in cold water.  This may need to be done more than once.\n| Drain again and dry the [[Chips|chips]] individually with [[Kitchen towel|kitchen towel]].\n| In a [[Roasting|roasting]] tin lined with [[Bake-O-Glide|bake-o-glide]] or [[Greaseproof paper|greaseproof paper]], position the [[Chips|chips]] so that they are in rows and not touching each other.  You will probably need to use more than one tin, or use the tin's [[Roasting|roasting]] rack upon which you can make a second layer.\n| Put in the [[Freezer|freezer]] for at least 30 minutes.\n| Meanwhile, heat the [[Oil|oil]] to 130 C and remove the [[Chips|chips]] from the [[Freezer|freezer]].\n| Pat them dry again and [[Deep-fry|deep-fry]] in small batches until they look as if they are starting to change colour.  This could take 4 minutes or more.\n| Drain on [[Kitchen towel|kitchen towel]] and when they are all cooked, return the to the [[Roasting|roasting]] tin and [[Freeze|freeze]] again for a further 30 minutes, or overnight if desired.\n| About 20 minutes before you are ready to serve, reheat the [[Oil|oil]] to 190 C and cook the [[Chips|chips]] in batches again until golden (about 2 minutes or more).\n| Drain and serve.\n}}\n===Alternative method stages 1-3===\n# Drain the soaked [[Chips|chips]] and bring a pan of cold, unsalted water to the [[Boil|boil]], then add the [[chips]].\n# Reduce the heat and allow to simmer until almost cooked.\n# Immediately, remove from heat, drain, and place them on a [[cake rack]] to cool, then follow from stage 4 above.\n#Instead of boiling the [[Chips|chips]], you can place them in a microwave in a covered container with 110ml water and cook for 6 minutes.  This is for large [[Chips|chips]] using a 900 watt microwave.\n===Serving suggestions===\nWell, [[Chips|chips]] can go with most dishes, but can also be served with [[Garlic mayonnaise|garlic mayonnaise]], dips or [[Sauces|sauces]] as a snack.  You could sprinkle some [[Grated|grated]] melty [[Cheese|cheese]] over them, such as [[Emmental]], [[Queso Tetilla|Tetilla]], [[Mozzarella]] or [[Cheddar]].\n===Variations===\nThey can be made as thick or thin as you wish, but you will have to adjust the [[Cooking times|cooking times]] accordingly.\n===Chef's notes===\nIf you do not have a deep-[[Fat|fat]] fryer, then a large saucepan will be fine, but DO be careful not to fill it more than a third full with the [[Oil|oil]].  You will also need a [[thermometer]] to check the temperatures.\n===See also===\n{{SeeAlso-chips}}\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes|Chipped potatoes]]\n[[Category:Accompaniments|Chipped potatoes]]\n[[Category:British recipes|Chipped potatoes]]\n[[Category:Potato recipes|Chipped potatoes]]\n[[Category:Snacks and light bites|Chipped potatoes]]\n[[Category:Vegetable recipes|Chipped potatoes]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes|Chipped potatoes]]\n[[Category:Deep fried]][[Category:Boiled or simmered]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#chips #roasting #thricecookedchippedpotatoes #freezer #boil #kitchentowel #cakerack #emmental #starch #greaseproofpaper #boiledorsimmered </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
