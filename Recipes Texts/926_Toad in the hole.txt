Just good [[bangers]] and [[batter pudding]].  It's all about personal taste, whilst the original was probably made with [[Pork|pork]] [[Sausages|sausages]], if you prefer smoked alligator sausages, make it with them instead!\n\nThis recipe is based on the batter recipe from Delia Smith's famous cookbook so has been proven time and again.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 2 tablespoons of olive oil\n| 1 medium [[onion]], peeled and sliced\n| 8 quality [[Sausages|sausages]] such as [[Debbie and Andrew's Perfect Cumberland Pork Sausages]]\n| 75 g (3 oz) [[Plain flour|plain flour]], sifted\n| 1 large [[Free range egg|free range egg]]\n| 75 ml (3 fl oz) cold [[Milk|milk]]\n| 55 ml (2 fl oz) water\n| ''130 ml - 5 fl oz in total''\n| [[Salt]] and [[Pepper|pepper]] to taste\n| Splash of [[Louisiana hot pepper sauce]] or [[Tabasco sauce]] (optional)\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Place a [[roasting tin]] in the oven and preheat 220\u00b0 C (425\u00b0 F - gas 7)\n| Fry the onion in 1 tablespoon of olive oil, in a frying pan for 4 minutes until the onions are soft.\n| Partially cook the sausages by frying in the same pan together with the onions for another 4 minutes.\n| Meanwhile add the remaining ingredients to a [[Food processor|food processor]] and blitz until you have a smooth batter\n| There should be enough fat from the sausages for the [[batter]], if not, add a tablespoon of oil.\n| Arrange the sausages and onions evenly in the tray and carefully heat the pan on the top of the oven for a 30 seconds so the oil bubbles  then pour the [[batter]] mix over the [[Sausages|sausages]]\n| [[Bake]] for 30 minutes at 220\u00b0 C (425\u00b0 F - gas 7) on the highest shelf in the oven until risen\n}}\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Toad in the hole.jpg|Toad in the hole, ready\nImage:Toad in the hole batter pud.jpg|batter poured into the hot pan\nImage:Toad in the hole sausages and onions.jpg|Sausages and onions lightly browned\n</gallery>\n===Serving suggestions===\n\nServe hot with [[Mashed potatoes|mashed potatoes]], [[Baked beans|baked beans]] and [[Brown sauce|brown sauce]].\n\n===Chef's notes===\n\nI'm always trying to improve recipes, this one included.  Originally I used the smaller Le Creuset cast iron rectangular dish but have had better luck using a large roasting tray.  I guess more room makes for a thinner batter which gets hotter and rises better.
