She kindly obliged; so here it is!\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| 1 teaspoon [[Pickling spice|pickling spice]]\n| 8 oz finely chopped white [[Onions|onions]]\n| &#189; pint [[Malt vinegar|malt vinegar]]\n| 8 oz [[Apples|apples]], peeled and cored and roughly chopped\n| 2 lb [[Tomatoes|tomatoes]], green or red, skinned. See notes\n| 1 rounded teaspoon [[Mustard powder|mustard powder]]\n| &#189; teaspoon [[Ginger powder|ginger powder]] or 1 teaspoon [[Fresh ginger|fresh ginger]]\n| &#189; teaspoon [[Salt|salt]]\n| &#189; teaspoon [[Freshly ground black pepper|freshly ground black pepper]]\n| 8 oz [[Sultanas|sultanas]]\n| 8 oz [[Sugar|sugar]] - [[Muscovado sugar]] or [[Jaggery|jaggery]] can also add a little uniqueness here\n}}\n\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| Put the [[Pickling spices|pickling spices]] in a piece of [[Muslin|muslin]]\n| Put the sliced [[Onions|onions]] in a pan with 2 or 3 tablespoons of the [[Malt vinegar|malt vinegar]] and [[Simmer|simmer]] until nearly soft\n| Add the peeled chopped [[Apples|apples]], skinned sliced [[Tomatoes|tomatoes]], [[Spices|spices]], [[Salt|salt]], and [[Sultanas|sultanas]]. [[Simmer]] until the mixture is quite soft, stirring from time-to-time.\n| Once soft, add the [[Sugar|sugar]] and remaining [[Vinegar|vinegar]], increase the heat to dissolve the sugar and [[Boil|boil]] until the mixture has a jammy consistency.\n| Remove the [[Muslin|muslin]] bag, pour into warm [[Sterilised|sterilised]] pots and seal immediately.\n| '''Store for one year before using'''.\n}}\n\n===Recipe source===\n\n* From a recipe book of bygone days - thank you [https://www.facebook.com/janet.potten Janet Potton].\n===Variations===\nGreen [[Tomatoes|tomatoes]] can be used instead of ripe tomatoes, they will just take longer to soften.\n===Chef's notes===\nI made this [[Pickle|pickle]] a year ago and tried it immediately.  Big mistake. I thought it was unpleasant so did not add the recipe to [[Cookipedia]].  I kept the jars of pickle and when I tasted it after it had matured for a year, it was delicious.\n\n[[Popping]] the [[Kilner jars]] into a [[Dishwasher|dishwasher]] cleans and sterilises them, and if your timing is good, they will be warm and ready for the [[Pickling|pickling]] process.\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Dips and sauces]]\n[[Category:Historic recipes]]\n[[Category:Pickles and preserves]]\n[[Category:Tapas, mezze and antipasti]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes]]\n[[Category:Fruit recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegetable recipes]]\n[[Category:Pickled]]\n[[Category:Boiled or simmered]]\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:12032020'>#tomatoes #apples #onions #sultanas #muslin #pickle #simmer #tomatochutney #maltvinegar #historicrecipes #vegetarianrecipes</code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
