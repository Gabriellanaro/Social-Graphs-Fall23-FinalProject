This hardens it  an turns it into a large crispy edible [[Taco|taco]]!\n\nYou must use an [[Oven|oven]]-proof bowl and you may have to experiment to find the bowl that produces the best shape.  I've found that  a small and a medium [[Glass|glass]] pyrex bowl work really well.\n\nFill them with the food of your choice, you'll find them to be much stronger than you might imagine.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| 1 pack of soft [[Wheat|wheat]] [[Flour tortilla|flour tortilla]] wraps or soft [[Cornmeal|cornmeal]] [[Tortilla|tortilla]] wraps.\n| [[Olive oil]] for spraying for [[Brushing|brushing]]\n}}\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n\n* Preheat the [[Oven|oven]] to 200\u00b0 C (400\u00b0 F - gas 6), [fan oven 180\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]\n\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| Lightly [[Spray|spray]] or [[Brush|brush]] your [[Oven|oven]]-proof bowls so the [[Tortilla|tortilla]] wrap doesn't stick once it has been [[Baked|baked]].\n| Lightly [[Spray|spray]] the top surface of the [[Tortilla|tortilla]] with a little [[Olive oil|olive oil]], not too much.\n| Push the [[Tortilla|tortilla]] into your bowl so it makes a 'useful' shape.\n| [[Bake]] the [[Tortillas|tortillas]], in the bowls for 6 minutes or until they start to colour.\n| Watch them closely as the time between [[Browning|browning]] and burning is really short!\n| Carefully remove the bowls from the [[Oven|oven]] and invert them over [[Paper towels|paper towels]] and knock the shaped [[Tortilla|tortilla]] out onto the paper towels.\n| They remain soft and pliable while they are still hot so leave them upside down for 15 minutes or so to cool and harden, ready for use.\n| If like me, you don't have enough bowls, you can make these in batches, they keep pretty well for a day or so.\n}}\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\n[[Image:Edible tortilla bowl.jpg.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Lightly greased and ready to bake]]\n</gallery>\n\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Mexican recipes]]\n[[Category:North American recipes]]\n[[Category:Tex-Mex recipes]]\n[[Category:Accompaniments]]\n[[Category:Bread and baking]]\n[[Category:Snacks and light bites]]\n[[Category:Starters]]\n[[Category:Tapas, mezze and antipasti]]\n[[Category:Vegan recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes]]\n[[Category:Salad recipes]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n[[Category:Favourite recipes]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#tortilla #tortillabaskets #spray #flourtortilla #wheat #brush #oliveoil #flour #yellowcornmeal #taco #miseenplace </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
