[[Chicken]] would work just as well.  Do ensure that the meat is properly cooked.  If you want to use uncooked [[chicken]] or [[turkey]], use [[Steamed chicken|this recipe]] to prepare it first.\n[[Image:Turkey pizza.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Turkey pizza ready to slide on to the [[pizza stone]]]]\n\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 1 portion of [[Pizza dough]] - Makes 2 pizzas\n| 2 balls of [[mozzarella cheese]]\n| 200g cooked [[Chicken|chicken]] or [[Turkey|turkey]]\n| &#189; bottle of [[Dolmio tomato and garlic pasta sauce]], or make your own [[Tomato sauce for pizza|pizza sauce]]\n| A few slices of raw [[Onion|onion]]\n| Slices of fresh [[green chillies]] (optional)\n| 30g grated [[cheddar cheese]] (optional)\n| 15ml olive oil\n| [[Fine yellow cornmeal]] for dusting\n\n}}\n\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n* Make the [[Pizza dough|pizza dough]] as instructed\n* If using a [[pizza stone]], preheat the [[pizza stone]] under a very hot [[grill]] for about 20 minutes.  Place it about 8cm (3\") from the heat source.\n\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Make 1 pizza per person\n| Sprinkle the worksurface with [[Cornmeal|cornmeal]]\n| Stretch or roll the [[Dough|dough]] into two thin rounds\n| Prick the pizzas all over with a fork. This prevents it puffing up too much and burning while it is cooking\n| Lightly [[Oil|oil]] one side of the [[Pizza|pizza]] and [[Grill|grill]], oiled side down for about 3 minutes or until it starts to brown and puff up.\n| Remove from the oven, flip over and add the topping.\n| Drizzle the [[Pizza|pizza]] with [[Olive oil|olive oil]] and spread the pizza with &frac12; of the [[Tomato sauce|tomato sauce]]\n| Lay a few slices of the raw onion on the tomato topping.\n| Add the chopped turkey \n| Top with torn [[Mozzarella|mozzarella]] and a drizzle of [[olive oil]].\n| [[Bake]] for 3 or 4  minutes or until the [[Cheese|cheese]] browns a little - watch it carefully as it can burn easily.\n| Keep the fist pizza warm at the bottom of the oven whilst you make the second.\n| Serve hot\n}}\n===Chef's notes===\nPasta sauce such as the 350 g Dolmio range makes a perfect pizza topping.  The unused half can be put straight in the freezer ready for the next two pizzas!\n\nIf you don't have a [[pizza stone]] you can lay the pizza on a [[grill tray]] instead, it just won't be quite as good.\n\n''I trust [[User:PaoloCastagna|Paolo]] won't be too upset that I have included this in the [[Italian recipes]] section.''\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Italian recipes]]\n[[Category:Bread and baking]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:Poultry recipes]]\n[[Category:Pizza recipes]][[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#turkeypizza #pizzastone #chicken #turkey #oliveoil #pizza #pizzadough #grill #mozzarella #bake #onion </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
