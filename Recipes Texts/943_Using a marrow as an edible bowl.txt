A scooped out [[marrow]] makes a really good edible plate or bowl.  In the time it takes to cook the marrow, the contents will be lovely and hot.  You could cook the contents from scratch but this was really an excuse to clear out the freezer.\n\nIn this instance , our filling was 1 portion of [[gulyas]] and 1 portion of a home-cooked [[chilli con carne]] that need a little more spice so both frozen meals were defrosted and mixed together with 3 finely chopped green indian chillies.\n\nThe blandness of the [[Marrow|marrow]] nicely offsets the spiciness of the [[Chilli|chilli]].\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| 1 medium sized [[Marrow|marrow]]\n| 2 portions of [[Chilli|chilli]]-con-carne or a similar meal that has plenty of [[Sauce|sauce]] and a chilli kick to it\n}}\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n\n* Preheat the [[Oven|oven]] to 200\u00b0 C (400\u00b0 F - gas 6), [fan oven 180\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour] - I've allowed for the oven preheat time in the preparation time, but you could add the [[Marrow|marrow]] when the oven is first turned on and increase the overall cooking time a little - the contents are cooked anyway so as soon as the marrow is softened, the meal is ready\n\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| [[Scoop]] out and discard the [[Marrow|marrow]] [[Seeds|seeds]] and enough of the flesh to leave room for your filling, being careful to leave enough flesh to contain the filling as the marrow will 'collapse' as it cooks\n| Place the two halves in an [[Oven|oven]]-proof dish that will prevent the [[Marrows|marrows]] from falling over during cooking. I wedged a roll of silicone [[Baking|baking]] mat between the two halves in order hold them up during cooking\n| [[Bake]] for 1 hour or until the [[Marrow|marrow]] is softened\n}}\n\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe with [[Pitta bread|pitta bread]].\n\n===Chef's notes===\nBe careful when eating this served straight from the [[Oven|oven]] as the [[Marrow|marrow]] can be very hot!\n\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Chilli pepper recipes]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:Squash recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegetable recipes]]\n\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#marrow #chilli #usingamarrowasanediblebowl #bake #miseenplace #gulyas #marrows #freezer #chilliconcarne #baking #sauce </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
