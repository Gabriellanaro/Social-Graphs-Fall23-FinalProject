Wig is my daughter's nickname for him.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 175g [[Plain flour|plain flour]], sieved with\n| 2 teaspoons [[Baking powder|baking powder]]\n| 3 large [[Eggs|eggs]], beaten\n| 175g soft [[Butter|butter]]\n| 175g [[Caster sugar|caster sugar]]\n| The [[Grated|grated]] rind of 1 [[Orange|orange]]\n| &frac12; teaspoon [[Vanilla extract|vanilla extract]]\n| 70g [[Walnuts|walnuts]], slightly bashed in a plastic bag\n| 50g Green and Black's Organic Dark [[Chocolate]] with Madagascan [[Vanilla]] (85% [[Cocoa|cocoa]]), coarsely bashed in a plastic bag\n| 10g [[Icing sugar]], for dusting\n\n}}\n\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n* Preheat the [[Oven|oven]] to 170\u00b0 C (325\u00b0 F - gas 3), [fan oven 140\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour].  \n* Place the [[Chocolate|chocolate]] in the [[Fridge|fridge]] whilst you are preparing the other ingredients.\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Place all of the ingredients (except for the [[Walnuts|walnuts]] and [[Chocolate|chocolate]]) into a mixing bowl.\n| Mix thoroughly using a [[Hand|hand]] or stand [[Mixer|mixer]] - if using a Kenwood Chef / Major, use the Flexi-Beater.\n| When the mixture is of an even consistency, add the [[Walnuts|walnuts]] and mix using the slowest setting.\n| Grease and line a 20cm (8 inch) loose bottomed deepish [[Cake|cake]] tin.  There is no need to line if you are using a Silverwood tin.\n| When the [[Oven|oven]] has reached the required temperature, gently mix in the [[Chocolate|chocolate]] using the slowest setting.\n| Pour the mixture into the tin, smooth it out and [[Bake|bake]] so that the top of the tin is about halfway down the [[Oven|oven]] for about 50-60 minutes.\n| Remove from the [[Oven|oven]] and allow to cool in the tin.\n| To touch, it may not seem cooked, but it is and if you over cook it, you will loose too much moisture.\n| Dust with [[Icing sugar|icing sugar]].\n}}\n===Variations===\nUse [[Hazelnuts|hazelnuts]] instead of [[Walnuts|walnuts]]\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Bread and baking]]\n[[Category:Sweets and desserts]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#chocolate #walnuts #wigscake #cake #orange #icingsugar #hand #castersugar #cocoa #hazelnuts #vanillaextract </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
