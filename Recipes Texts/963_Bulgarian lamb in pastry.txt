In order to retain the butter marinade, I made a few deep cuts rather than lots of little ones.  I also drained off most of the fat after the first roast.  Being lazy I used a 450g ready-rolled sheet of shortcrust pastry which was fine for a small joint, it would not be large enough for a 1.5kg joint.  It was superb with [[onion gravy]] and mixed vegetables.\n===Variations===\n* 1 teaspoon of dried [[Mexican oregano]]\n* 1/2 a teaspoon dried [[mint]]\n* 1 teaspoon finely chopped fresh [[rosemary]]\n* 1 teaspoon fresh [[thyme]]\n* 4 finely chopped [[anchovy fillets]]\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe in slices with [[Vegetables|vegetables]] and [[Gravy|gravy]].\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes|Lamb]]\n[[Category:Bulgarian recipes|Lamb]]\n[[Category:Lamb recipes|Lamb]]\n[[Category:Main courses|Lamb]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes|Lamb]]\n[[Category:Favourite recipes|Lamb]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#lamb #bulgarianlambinpastry #egg #roasting #pastry #butter #garlic #lemonjuice #kitchenstring #herbs #fridge </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
