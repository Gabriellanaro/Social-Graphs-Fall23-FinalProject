Quantities show are for 4 people:\n\nI halved the fish quantity because I felt that 250g per person was excessive especially as the other ingredients are quite rich. [[Basa]] is now my [[fish]] of choice.  It is sustainable, firm fleshed, has a good flavour and is extremely economical (\u00a38.00 per kg). \n\nI increased the volume of [[mushrooms]] because I like them.  I Used Sour cream and more cheese because I love the flavours and increased the number of eggs to balance the lack of fish and because they were available. I used [[ghee]] because I had no [[butter]] and made up the required quantity with [[olive oil]] to reduce the [[saturated fat]] intake.  \n* 500 g [[basa|basa fillets]], cut into 5 cm squares\n* [[Flour]]\n* Seasoning - omit salt altogether if using [[haloumi]] as it is so very salty\n* 25 g [[ghee]], melted\n* 25 g [[olive oil]]\n* 3 [[Hard boiled eggs|hard boiled eggs]], sliced\n* 150 g [[Mushrooms|mushrooms]], thinly sliced\n* 2 tablespoons Hungarian [[Paprika|paprika]]\n* 120 g [[Grated|grated]] [[Haloumi]]\n* 300 ml [[sour cream]], mixed with 1 tablespoon [[Plain flour|plain flour]]\n--[[User:Chef|Chef]] 19:32, 8 August 2010 (BST)\n===Chef's notes===\nI can confirm that even with half the quantity of fish, there was more fish than we could eat.  This dish is really nice, however it is very creamy and heavy.  It really needs something acidic to counteract the richness. Although not at all authentic, tonight, the second half of this will be served with [[pasta]] and a [[Grapefruit salsa]].  \n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes|Halibut with yogurt]]\n[[Category:Bulgarian recipes|Halibut with yogurt]]\n[[Category:Cheese recipes|Halibut with yogurt]]\n[[Category:Egg recipes|Halibut with yogurt]]\n[[Category:Fish recipes|Halibut with yogurt]]\n[[Category:Main courses|Halibut with yogurt]]\n[[Category:Sea fish recipes|Halibut with yogurt]]\n[[Category:Stews and casseroles|Halibut with yogurt]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#halibutwithyoghurt #mushrooms #fish #yoghurt #paprika #butter #haloumi #basa #halibut #flour #hardboiledeggs </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
