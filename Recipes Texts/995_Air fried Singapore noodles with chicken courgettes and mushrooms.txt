When everything is almost done, everything is added together in the large fan [[Air-fryer|air-fryer]], mix together and the [[Noodle|noodle]] and [[Bean sprouts|bean sprouts]] are added and cooked for the last few minutes.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n}}\n====Vegetable mix====\n{{RecipeIngredientsNB\n| 1 tablespoon [[Olive oil|olive oil]]\n| 125g sliced [[Button mushrooms|button mushrooms]]\n| 1 large [[Onion|onion]], peeled and sliced\n| 2 medium [[Sweet peppers|sweet peppers]], cored and chopped into strips\n| 1 large [[Courgette|courgette]] cut into slices\n| 2 tablespoons [[Sesame oil|sesame oil]]\n| 2 thumb-sized pieces of ginger, cut into thin slices - no need to peel the ginger!\n}}\n====Chicken and marinade====\n{{RecipeIngredientsNB\n| 2 large [[Chicken breasts|chicken breasts]] cut into bite-sized pieces\n| 2 tablespoons [[Dark soy sauce|dark soy sauce]]\n| 1 teaspoon [[Sesame oil|sesame oil]]\n| 2 tablespoons of [[Lime juice|lime juice]]\n| &#189; teaspoon [[Demerara sugar|demerara sugar]]\n| &#189; teaspoon [[Sea Salt|sea salt]]\n| Pinch of [[Black pepper|black pepper]]\n| 1 heaped teaspoon of [[Curry powder|curry powder]]\n| 1 teaspoon [[Turmeric|turmeric]]\n| 1 teaspoon [[Chilli flakes|chilli flakes]]\n| 1 teaspoon [[Coriander|coriander]] whole [[Seeds|seeds]]\n| A pinch of whole [[Fenugreek seeds|fenugreek seeds]]\n| A good pinch of [[5 spice powder]]\n| 4 [[Fat|fat]] [[Cloves of Garlic, peeled and crushed|cloves of garlic, peeled and crushed]]\n}}\n====Noodles and beanshoots====\n{{RecipeIngredientsNB\n| 200g pre-cooked [[Egg noodles|egg noodles]]\n| 125g [[Bean|bean]] shoots\n}}\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n\n* Add the [[Chicken|chicken]]  and [[Marinade|marinade]] ingredients to a [[Lock and Lock box]], cover and shake really well to combine\n* Leave for a few hours to [[Marinade|marinade]], shaking now and then if you have the time\n\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| Coat the rotary [[Air Fryer|air fryer]] with 1 tablespoon of [[Olive oil|olive oil]]\n| Add the remaining [[Vegetable|vegetable]] mix ingredients into the [[Air-fryer|air-fryer]] pan and drizzle with the [[Sesame oil|sesame oil]]\n| Cook on the highest temperature setting (usually for [[Chips|chips]]) for about 15 minutes\n| After the [[Vegetables|vegetables]] have cooked for about 10 minutes, leave them cooking while you add the [[Chicken|chicken]] [[Marinade|marinade]] to the [[Pro Breeze Air Fryer|pro breeze air fryer]] (the fan-[[Oven|oven]] type)\n| Cook for the marinaded chicken with the marinade for 10 minutes at 200\u00b0 C\n| By this time the [[Mushrooms|mushrooms]] and [[Onions|onions]] should have started to colour\n| Add the cooked [[Vegetables|vegetables]], [[Bean|bean]] shoots and [[Noodles|noodles]] to the [[Chicken|chicken]] mixture, stir well and cook for a further 5 minutes, stirring now and then\n| serve immediately\n}}\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Singapore_noodles_with_chicken_chicken_and_vegetables_with_noodles.jpg|Everything mixed together, ready to serve\nImage:Singapore_noodles_with_chicken_chicken_and_vegetables.jpg|The vegetables mixed in with the spicy chicken pieces\nImage:Singapore_noodles_with_chicken_marinading.jpg|The chicken after a few hours in the marinade\nImage:Singapore_noodles_with_chicken_vegetables_cooked.jpg|The vegetables after 15 minutes\nImage:Singapore_noodles_with_chicken_vegetables_in_air_fryer.jpg|The vegetables loaded into the Tefal air-fryer\nImage:Singapore_noodles_with_chicken_colourful_ingredients.jpg|Most of the very colourful ingredients\n</gallery>\n\n===Serving suggestions===\nA few quartered [[Tomatoes|tomatoes]] were a nice fresh [[Accompaniment|accompaniment]] to this dish\n===Variations===\nAny chopped [[Vegetables|vegetables]] work well in this, especially, oddly, [[Cucumbers|cucumbers]]!\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Chinese recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Spicy recipes]]\n[[Category:Chilli pepper recipes]]\n[[Category:Garlic recipes]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:Poultry recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegetable recipes]]\n[[Category:Air fried recipes]]\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:12032020'>#vegetables #sesameoil #marinade #airfryer #chicken #airfryers #singaporenoodles #bean #oliveoil #noodles #lockandlockbox</code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
