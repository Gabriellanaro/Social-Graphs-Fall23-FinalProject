The recipe was taken from '''[http://www.vegalicious.org/2007/04/18/armenian-apricot-and-lentil-soup/ VegaliciousRecipes]'''.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 55 g red [[Lentils|lentils]]\n| 55 g [[Dried apricots|dried apricots]], soaked if necessary\n| 1 large [[Potato|potato]], chopped\n| 625 ml [[Vegetable Stock|vegetable stock]]\n| The [[Juice|juice]] of &frac12; a [[Lemon|lemon]]\n| 1 teaspoon [[Ground cumin|ground cumin]]\n| 3 tablespoons [[Parsley|parsley]], finely chopped\n| Seasoning\n| Croutons to garnish\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Place [[Lentils|lentils]] in a large saucepan.\n| Add the remaining ingredients to the pan.\n| Bring to the [[Boil|boil]], cover and [[Simmer|simmer]] for 20 minutes.\n| Allow to cool, then pur\u00e9e until smooth.\n| Reheat to serving temperature and adjust seasoning to taste.\n| Garnish with the croutons.\n}}\n===Chef's notes===\nMade this with 1.25 litres of good stock and it resembled a Dickensian gruel. Far too much liquid. Did some reducing, thickening, general messing and it was quite nice.\n\nSuggest leaving the same ingredients but reducing the stock and suggesting that it should only serve 2 people. It could never look like their photo with the original quantities.\n\nWe also fried some onions and garlic and added those to the mix before pureeing. Nice recipe, even so.\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes|Apricot and lentil soup]]\n[[Category:Armenian recipes|Apricot and lentil soup]]\n[[Category:Grain and bean recipes|Apricot and lentil soup]]\n[[Category:Potato recipes|Apricot and lentil soup]]\n[[Category:Soup and stock recipes|Apricot and lentil soup]]\n[[Category:Starters|Apricot and lentil soup]]\n[[Category:Vegan recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegetable recipes|Apricot and lentil soup]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes|Apricot and lentil soup]]\n[[Category:Fruit recipes]]\n[[Category:Boiled or simmered]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#apricotandlentilsoup #lentils #lemon #juice #unusualrecipes #vegetablestock #driedapricots #simmer #potato #parsley #boil </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
