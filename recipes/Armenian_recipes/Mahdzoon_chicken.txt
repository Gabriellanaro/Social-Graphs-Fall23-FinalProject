I rescued this by thickening with a little [[cornflour]]. Using [[cr\u00e8me fraiche]] instead of [[yogurt]] would prevent this problem and produce an equally good dish. \n===Serving suggestions===\nProbably not very authentic, but this dish went really well with [[spaghetti]]!.\n==See also==\n* {{See also - Jointing a chicken}}\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes|Mahdzoon chicken]]\n[[Category:Armenian recipes|Mahdzoon chicken]]\n[[Category:Main courses|Mahdzoon chicken]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes|Mahdzoon chicken]]\n[[Category:Poultry recipes|Mahdzoon chicken]]\n[[Category:Cooking with wine|Mahdzoon chicken]]\n[[Category:Favourite recipes|Mahdzoon chicken]]\n[[Category:Boiled or simmered]]\n[[Category:Pan fried]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#mahdzoonchicken #chicken #basil #oliveoil #onions #yoghurt #marinade #garlic #yogurt #cornflour #wine </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
