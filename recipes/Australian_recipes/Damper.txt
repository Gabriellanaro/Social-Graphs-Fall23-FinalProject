As you can see from the photo, the top flew off from the base on one side of the loaf.  I think that to rectify this I should either flatten the dough once I have shaped it into a ball and reduce the amount of baking powder.  It also tasted too salty.\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Australian recipes]]\n[[Category:Bread and baking]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#damper #dough #bake #wholemealflour #bakingpowder #bread #butter #miseenplace #unsaltedbutter #coolingrack #unusualrecipes </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
