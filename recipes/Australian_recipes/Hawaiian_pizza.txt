Often versions will have mixed [[Peppers|peppers]], [[Mushrooms|mushrooms]] and [[Bacon|bacon]]. Another variety consists of [[Pineapple|pineapple]] and Canadian [[Bacon|bacon]]. It is the most popular pizza in Australia, accounting for 15% of pizza sales. ''Wikipedia''.\n\nThis version is the [[Ham|ham]], [[mozzarella]] and [[Pineapple|pineapple]] version - and very good it is too.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| 1 portion [[Pizza dough|pizza dough]]\n| 4 tablespoons [[Tomato sauce for pizza]]\n| 250 g pack of sliced cooked [[Ham|ham]]\n| 2 balls of [[Mozzarella cheese|mozzarella cheese]], torn into small pieces\n| 280g can of [[Pineapple|pineapple]] slices or chunks (about 280g)\n| [[Olive oil]]\n| [[Sea Salt|sea salt]] and [[Freshly ground black pepper|freshly ground black pepper]]\n| 1/2 an [[Onion|onion]], peeled and sliced, optional\n| [[Fine yellow cornmeal|fine yellow cornmeal]] for dusting\n\n}}\n\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n\n* If using a [[Pizza stone|pizza stone]], preheat the [[Pizza stone|pizza stone]] under a very hot [[Grill|grill]] for about 20 minutes. Place it about 8 cm (3\") from the heat source.\n* Leave the [[Pineapple|pineapple]] pieces draining in a [[Sieve|sieve]] while you prepare the [[Pizzas|pizzas]] - too much [[Juice|juice]] can make a soggy [[Pizza|pizza]].\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| Preheat the [[Grill|grill]] to high as you can get it\n| Set the [[Pizza stone|pizza stone]] about 8 cm (3\") below the heat source or the [[Pizza|pizza]] may burn\n| Dust the work surface with [[Fine yellow cornmeal|fine yellow cornmeal]] and then stretch or roll the [[Dough|dough]] into two thin rounds\n| Prick the pizzas all over with a fork. This prevents it puffing up too much and burning while it is cooking.\n| [[Grill]] the [[Pizza|pizza]] for about 2 minutes on one side only or until [[Browned|browned]].\n| Remove from the [[Oven|oven]], flip over and add the topping.\n| First give a little drizzle of [[Olive oil|olive oil]] then layer the [[Ham|ham]] [[Cheese|cheese]] and [[Pineapple|pineapple]] over the [[Pizza|pizza]].\n| Add a drizzle of [[Olive oil|olive oil]] and [[Bake|bake]] for for 3 to 5 minutes (depending on how hot your [[Oven|oven]] is) or until the [[Cheese|cheese]] browns a little. Watch it carefully as it's easy to burn at such a high heat.\n| Serve!\n}}\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Australian recipes]]\n[[Category:North American recipes]]\n[[Category:Bread and baking]]\n[[Category:Cheese recipes]]\n[[Category:Fruit recipes]]\n[[Category:Pizza recipes]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#pineapple #pizza #ham #hawaiianpizza #oliveoil #pizzastone #cheese #grill #fineyellowcornmeal #bacon #pizzas </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
