I used a tablespoon of butter instead of dripping, one whole large onion, peeled and sliced fairly thickly.  The fillet rested on the onion slices with the remaining onion placed on top. I used [[Gruy\u00e8re cheese]] and 4 tablespoons of sour cream.\n\nThe fillet was cooked for 30 minutes as stated above, but then only for another 20 minutes covered.\n\nI find gravy made with lamb fat rather cloying and unpleasant so I drained the fat when the fillet was cooked, cut into medallions and served with the lovely caramelised onions.  Do ensure you get all of the crispy melted cheese! Instead of gravy, I used the remaining [[sour cream]] as a dressing for the boiled potatoes.\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Australian recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Lamb recipes]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n[[Category:Favourite recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#sourcreamlambchops #bake #sourcream #lamb #dripping #cream #cheddarcheese #fat #bakingtin #cornflour #cayennepepper </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
