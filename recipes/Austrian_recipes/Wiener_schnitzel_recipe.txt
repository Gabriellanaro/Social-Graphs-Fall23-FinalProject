This is due to the way in which the animals are transported and the conditions in which they are kept.  However, these issues mainly relate to continental produced veal and there is British veal available which has been produced from happy animals.   Look out for British 'ros\u00e9' [[veal]], which is pinker than the continental variety.  As far as I am aware, it is available from Marks and Spencer, Tesco and Waitrose.\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes|Wiener schnitzel]]\n[[Category:Austrian recipes|Wiener schnitzel]]\n[[Category:Beef recipes|Wiener schnitzel]]\n[[Category:Main courses|Wiener schnitzel]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes|Wiener schnitzel]]\n[[Category:Veal recipes|Wiener schnitzel]]\n[[Category:Deep fried]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#veal #flour #breadcrumbs #butter #egg #unusualrecipes #greaseproofpaper #wienerschnitzel #lemonslices #groundblackpepper #cheese </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
