You do need a big pot though!\n\nIf you enjoy your food spicy, try '''[[Lamb tangia]]''', it's very similar to this recipe and I think it's even nicer.\n\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 1 leg of [[Lamb|lamb]]\n| [[Olive oil]] for [[Frying|frying]]\n| 6 rashers of [[Home smoked bacon|home smoked bacon]], chunky streaky [[Bacon|bacon]] or a small packet of [[Lardons|lardons]]\n| 4 [[Cloves|cloves]] of [[Garlic]], peeled and crushed\n| 3 [[Onions|onions]], peeled and cut into 4\n| 4 large [[Potatoes|potatoes]], peeled and cut into chunks\n| 5 [[Carrots|carrots]], peeled and cut in half, lengthwise\n| 2 [[Parsnips|parsnips]], peeled and cut in half, lengthways\n| 3 [[Celery|celery]] stick, cut into thick 'moons'\n| A few handfuls of [[Fresh herbs|fresh herbs]]\n| 2 [[Bay leaves|bay leaves]]\n| 1 bottle of [[Dry white wine|dry white wine]]\n| [[Sea Salt|sea salt]] and [[Freshly ground black pepper|freshly ground black pepper]]\n}}\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Jamies 4 hour lamb ready to stew.jpg|Ready for the oven\nImage:Jamies 4 hour lamb ingredients.jpg|Ingredients for 4, using [[lamb shanks]] instead of a leg of lamb and [[chorizo]] instead of [[bacon]]\n</gallery>\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Preheat the oven to 160\u00b0 C (325\u00b0 F - gas 3 - Moderately slow/Warm)\n| If you are using a glass casserole dish, do the [[Frying|frying]] in a separate pan, otherwise..\n| Add a few splashes of [[Olive oil|olive oil]] to a huge ovenproof pot or deep [[Roasting dish]] and [[Brown|brown]] the [[Lamb|lamb]] all over\n| Remove the [[Lamb|lamb]] for the next stage\n| [[Fry]] the [[Onions|onions]], [[Garlic|garlic]] and [[Bacon|bacon]] and [[Celery|celery]] for 4 minutes\n| Add a splash of [[White wine|white wine]] and [[Deglaze|deglaze]] the pan\n| Add your [[Lamb|lamb]] back (or move everything to your casserole dish)\n| Add the remaining [[Wine|wine]] and an equal amount of water and all of the remaining ingredients\n| Cover, with [[tin-foil]] if you are using a [[roasting tray]]\n| Roast for 4 to 5 hours - I find 4 hours sufficient although we don't use a particularly large cut of [[Meat|meat]]\n| Season the gravy to taste with [[Salt|salt]] and [[Black pepper|black pepper]]\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\n\nServe hot with crusty [[Bread|bread]] to soak up the delicious gravy\n\n===Variations===\nUse any [[Vegetables|vegetables]] you have knocking around at the time, just cut them (equally) on the large size, bearing in mind the time that it's cooking for.  We have lots of winter [[Squashes|squashes]] at the moment so I think I may use half a small [[Butternut squash|butternut squash]] instead of the [[Parsnips|parsnips]] - not my favourite [[Vegetables|vegetables]]!\n===Chef's notes===\nEnsure that you use a dry white wine.  I have made this with a medium/sweet wine and it was a little too sweet for my taste.\n==See also==\n\n* [[Slow roast recipes]]\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes|Lamb]]\n[[Category:Lamb recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses|Lamb]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes|Lamb]]\n[[Category:Cooking with wine]]\n[[Category:Stews and casseroles]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Favourite recipes]]\n[[Category:Stewed, braised or pot roasted]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#lamb #vegetables #bacon #whitewine #chorizo #oliveoil #parsnips #onions #potatoes #lambshanks #4hourlambstew </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
