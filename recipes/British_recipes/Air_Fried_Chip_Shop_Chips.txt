You only need a few tablespoons of [[Olive oil|olive oil]] to cook chips for two people.\n\nYou need a few kitchen gadgets to make these, but it is well worth the effort.

We've found this helps to really crisp them and make them evenly golden.\n===Chef's notes===\nWe have found that the paddle-type of [[Air Fryer|air fryer]], such as the Tefal Actifry makes the best [[Chips|chips]] - superior to the non-paddle type.\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Snacks and light bites]]\n[[Category:Tapas, mezze and antipasti]]\n[[Category:Vegan recipes]]\n[[Category:Potato recipes]]\n[[Category:Air fried recipes]]\n[[Category:Cookery cheats]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:12032020'>#potatoes #chips #oliveoil #speedpeeler #airfryer #sophitopotatochipper #saladspinner #maltvinegar #salted #starch #unusualrecipes</code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
