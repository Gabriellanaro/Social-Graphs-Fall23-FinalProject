Always use large potatoes and cut them either in halves or into quarters. The tumbling action of the air-fryer tends to bump the corners and fluff them up.  Small whole potatoes tend to become 'polished' and don't 'fluff-up' at all.   They are still very crispy, but not as good as square-cut potatoes whole potatoes (pictured).\n\nAnother good way to get 'fluffy' roasties is to crush them slightly, halfway through the cooking process.\n\nA list of the best potato varieties for making [[roast potatoes]] can be '''[[:Category:Potato_recipes#ROAST_POTATOES|found here]]'''.\n\nNote to self: 45 minutes is probably an ideal time to aim for.\n\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Air fried recipes]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Accompaniments]]\n[[Category:Vegan recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes]]\n[[Category:Potato recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegetable recipes]]\n[[Category:Favourite recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#onion #roastpotatoes #oliveoil #airfriedroastpotatoes #airfry #bayleaves #potatoes #boiling #airfried #favouriterecipes #airfrier </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
