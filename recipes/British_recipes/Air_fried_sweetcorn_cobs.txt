The [[Corn|corn]] cobs need to be cut in half to fit in the [[Air fryer|air fryer]], but this is also how they are often sold (in the UK).\n\nThe [[Tefal ActiFry AL806040 Air Fryer]] is still my favourite cooking tool.  It's so ugly it needs to be stored in the conservatory but it's still brought into use a couple of times a week.  It is also a ''must-have'' for the motorhome!\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| 1 [[Sweetcorn|sweetcorn]] cob cut into two halves\n| Pinch of [[Salt|salt]]\n| 1 teaspoon of [[Butter|butter]]\n}}\n\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| Pop the halved [[Sweetcorn|sweetcorn]] cobs in the airfryer with a teaspoon of [[Butter|butter]] and a pinch of [[Salt|salt]].\n| [[Air fry]] for 20 minutes.\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe with a little extra [[Butter|butter]]\n===Chef's notes===\nThe start photograph shown 1 tablespoon of [[Butter|butter]], but that was far too much.
