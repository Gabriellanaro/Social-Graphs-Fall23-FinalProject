No oil used so nice and healthy too\n\nI've actually used [[basa]] as it's half the price of cod, I prefer it to [[cod]].\n\nI already have batches of frozen [[tomato sauce for pizza]], which is what I've used in this recipe. You could use any bottled tomato sauce, it's just used as flavouring and to help the breadcrumbs stick to the fish.\n\nWe have a huge list of [[Tomato ketchup|tomato sauce recipes here]].  If none of those take your fancy, use good old Heinz tomato ketchup, it will be fine!\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| 2 [[Cod|cod]] or [[basa]] fillets of around 250g or once large 500g steak cut in two\n| 5 heaped tablespoons of [[Breadcrumbs|breadcrumbs]]\n| 5 tablespoons freshly [[Grated|grated]] [[Parmesan cheese|parmesan cheese]]\n| 100g [[tomato sauce for pizza]] (or [[tomato sauce]] of your choice) - about 4 tablespoons\n| [[Olive oil to grease the [[baking tray]]]]\n| [[Freshly ground black pepper]] - no [[salt]] needed as [[Parmesan]] is already quite salty.\n}}\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n\n* Check and remove any pin-[[bones]] from the [[Cod|cod]] or [[basa]] fillets\n* Preheat the [[Oven|oven]] to 180\u00b0 C (350\u00b0 F - gas 4), [fan oven 160\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]\n\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| Put the [[Breadcrumbs|breadcrumbs]] into a bowl and add the [[Grated|grated]] [[Parmesan]] and a pinch of [[Black pepper|black pepper]] and mix well to combine.\n| \n| Paint the fish fillets with a tablespoon of [[tomato sauce]] per side.\n| Arrange half of the breadcrumb mixture onto a large plate and press the fish down so the breadcrumbs stick. \n| Repeat with both fillets on both sides.\n| Lightly [[Brush|brush]] or [[Spray|spray]] a [[Baking tray|baking tray]] with [[Olive oil|olive oil]] and lay the fillets on the tray skin side down if your fillets have skin.\n| Sprinkle the remaining breadcrumbs over the top.\n| [[Bake]] for 20 minutes without turning over and finish under the [[Grill|grill]] for a few minutes if needed.\n}}\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Baked cod with tomato and parmesan crust ready to bake.jpg|Parmesan and Panko crust, ready to bake\nImage:Baked cod with tomato and parmesan preparation.jpg|My breadcrumbing station!\n</gallery>\n===Serving suggestions===\nThis went nicely with [[mashed potato]], [[peas]] and [[sweetcorn]].\n==See also==\n* http://www.fishonline.org/fish/cod-atlantic-cod-30\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Cheese recipes]]\n[[Category:Fish recipes]]\n[[Category:Sea fish recipes]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#basa #cod #grated #bakingtray #breadcrumbs #parmesan #bakedcodwithtomatoandparmesancrust #tomatosauce #oliveoil #grill #peas </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
