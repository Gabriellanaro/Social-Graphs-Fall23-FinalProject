[[Taco shells]] have the same ingredients, but thankfully no added slat or flavours (yet!)\n\nI've pre-cooked the [[Squash|squash]] first as some [[Squashes|squashes]] take longer than others to soften and the dish would be pointless in a [[Rock|rock]] hard squash, over cooked squashes however, are fine.\n\nPre cooking the [[Squash|squash]] allows you to blot up any liquid released during cooking before you add the [[Cheese|cheese]].\n\nIf you know how long your [[Squash|squash]] will take to soften then you could [[Bake|bake]] it with the [[Cheese|cheese]] from the start.\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| 1 small [[Squash|squash]] ([[Butternut squash|butternut squash]] would be fine)\n| [[Garlic]] to taste, peelded and crushed or very thinly sliced - I used 3 [[Cloves|cloves]] to cook the [[Squash|squash]] and 3 to fill the [[Cheese|cheese]].\n| 2 teaspoons of [[Olive oil|olive oil]]\n| [[Salt]] & [[Freshly ground black pepper|freshly ground black pepper]]\n| 1 whole [[Camembert cheese]] (I used a third of the wheel per person)\n| 2 tablespoons of [[shaved D\u017eiugas cheese]] (or [[Parmesan]])\n| 30ml of [[Sherry|sherry]]\n}}\n==== to serve====\n{{RecipeIngredientsNB\n| 6 [[Taco shells]]\n| A few [[Tomatoes|tomatoes]]\n}}\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n\n* Preheat your [[Oven|oven]] to 180\u00b0 C (350\u00b0 F - gas 4), [fan oven 160\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Baked squash filled with melted camembert cheese cheese loaded.jpg|The cheese loaded, ready for the last 15 minutes\nImage:Baked squash filled with melted camembert cheese part-baked squash.jpg|The squash, partially baked\nImage:Baked squash filled with melted camembert cheese ingredients.jpg|The basic ingredients\n</gallery>\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| Halve the [[Squash|squash]] top to tail (through the stem), [[Scoop|scoop]] out the [[Seeds|seeds]] and discard.\n| Crush a few [[Cloves of garlic|cloves of garlic]] with a pinch of [[Salt|salt]] and [[Freshly ground black pepper|freshly ground black pepper]], mix with a few teaspoons of [[Olive oil|olive oil]] and rub around the inside of the [[Squash|squash]].\n| [[Bake]] on an [[Oven tray|oven tray]] for 20 to 30 minutes or until it starts to soften.\n| Remove from the [[Oven|oven]] and use a [[Kitchen towel|kitchen towel]] to swab any excess liquid that may have formed during the cooking. \n| Cut the [[Camembert]] into thirds, and save the last third for another time.
