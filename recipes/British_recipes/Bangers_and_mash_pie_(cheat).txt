As I had a few spare [[spring onions]] in the fridge, I chopped them up and added them to the mash and the gravy.  I also added a little [[squash mash]] to the mash and also sprinkled a little grated cheese over the top.  For 2 greedy people, I made half of the mash quantity but kept the other ingredients the same. \nA very nice recipe!\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Cookery cheats]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:Pork recipes]]\n[[Category:Favourite recipes]]\n[[Category:Student recipes]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n[[Category:Grilled, griddled or barbecued]]\n[[Category:Boiled or simmered]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#potatoes #sausages #gravy #butter #bake #boiling #diced #mash #springonions #pickle #branstonpickle </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
