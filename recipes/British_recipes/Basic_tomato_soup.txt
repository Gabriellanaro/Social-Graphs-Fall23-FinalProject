Re-heat by simmering only.\n===Chef's notes===\nYou can use fresh [[Tomatoes|tomatoes]] instead of tinned, providing they are tasty and ripe.  The flavourless, under-ripened ones commonly sold in British supermarkets are not suitable.  For my personal taste, I think a teaspoon of [[sugar]] is needed, but does depend on the acidity of your [[tomatoes]].\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes|Tomato soup basic]]\n[[Category:British recipes|Tomato soup basic]]\n[[Category:Historic recipes|Tomato soup basic]]\n[[Category:Snacks and light bites|Tomato soup basic]]\n[[Category:Soup and stock recipes|Tomato soup basic]]\n[[Category:Starters|Tomato soup basic]]\n[[Category:Pork recipes|Tomato soup basic]]\n[[Category:Vegetable recipes|Tomato soup basic]]\n[[Category:Boiled or simmered|Tomato soup basic]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#soup #tomatoes #diced #herbs #vegetables #cornflour #basictomatosoup #parsley #bacon #dripping #lard </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
