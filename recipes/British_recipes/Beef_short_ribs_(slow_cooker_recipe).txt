As they make such a substantial meal, I just used 2 [[Ribs|ribs]] for 2 people.  This meant cutting the now [[Frozen|frozen]] 4 ribs (pictured) in half.  You need a clean [[hacksaw]] for this, it's no job for a knife!\n\nNormally I would [[Brown|brown]] the [[Meat|meat]] and [[Onions|onions]], but I thought I would try to make this a speed preparation that you could throw in the [[Slow cooker|slow cooker]] before going out for the day.  I'll cook it on low so all the collagen breaks down into lovely [[gravy]].\n\nIf you get a chance, it helps to skim any excess [[Fat|fat]] and give it a stir halfway through, however, it will be fine without.\n\n[[Beef short ribs]].jpg\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| 600g [[Beef short ribs|beef short ribs]] - (2 ribs), half the quantity pictured\n| 1 teaspoon [[Mustard powder|mustard powder]]\n| 1 tablespoon [[Fine yellow cornmeal|fine yellow cornmeal]] ([[Plain flour|plain flour]] would be fine)\n| pinch of [[Salt|salt]] and [[Freshly ground black pepper|freshly ground black pepper]]\n| 1 tablespoon [[Olive oil|olive oil]]\n| 160 grams [[bacon lardons]]\n| 1 [[Oxo cube|oxo cube]], crumbled into 150 ml boiling water\n| 2 tablespoons of [[tomato puree]]\n| 6 [[Banana shallots|banana shallots]], peeled and cut into rings\n| 2 [[Cloves of garlic|cloves of garlic]], peeled, smashed and roughly chopped\n| 300 ml [[Red wine|red wine]]\n| A splash of [[Port|port]]\n| [[Juice]] and [[Zest|zest]] of a [[Lime|lime]]\n| A small [[Bouquet garni|bouquet garni]] (I used [[Thyme|thyme]], [[Sage|sage]], 2 [[Bay leaves|bay leaves]], [[Rosemary|rosemary]] and [[Parsley|parsley]])\n}}\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n\n* Switch the [[Slow cooker|slow cooker]] on to the low setting before you start to prepare.\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:IMG 4920.jpg|thumb|After 10 hours in the slow cooker\nImage:Beef_short_ribs.jpg|I used half the quantity pictured\n</gallery>\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| Mix the [[Mustard|mustard]], [[Yellow cornmeal|yellow cornmeal]] together and add to a plate\n| Rub 1 tablespoon of [[Olive oil|olive oil]] over the [[Ribs|ribs]]\n| Roll the [[Ribs|ribs]] in the [[Flour|flour]] to coat\n| Add the [[Ribs|ribs]] to the [[Slow cooker|slow cooker]] with any leftover [[Flour|flour]].

You don't want back ribs as these are not the same.  I understand from talking to a butcher that this particular cut of [[beef]] is also known as 'Jacob's ladder'.\n\nI've found it difficult to obtain [[beef short ribs]] from anywhere but a specialist butchers and even then, they needed to be ordered in advance.  I was delighted to discover [[F. Conisbee specialist butchers]] had them in stock. 4 [[Argentine ribs]] for \u00a321.04.  Robert cut them in half again lengthwise with the bandsaw. One of these half-ribs per person is plenty!\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Beef recipes]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:Cooking with wine]]\n[[Category:Slow cooker recipes]]\n[[Category:Slow cooked]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#beefshortribs #ribs #slowcooker #fat #oliveoil #bouquetgarni #argentineribs #flour #redwine #thyme #miseenplace </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
