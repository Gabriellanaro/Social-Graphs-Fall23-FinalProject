You'll need thin [[Fish|fish]] filets that don't fall apart when cooked.\n\nIdeally serve with [[Chips|chips]].\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| 2 Thin [[Fish|fish]] fillets (suggested: [[Cod|cod]] fillets, [[basa]] fillets, [[Catfish|catfish]] fillets, [[tilapia]], or [[Flounder|flounder]])\n| [[Oil]] with a high smoke point ([[Groundnut oil|groundnut oil]], [[Canola oil|canola oil]], [[Sunflower oil|sunflower oil]])\n| 1 [[Egg white]], whisked\n| 1 cup [[Plain flour|plain flour]] ([[All purpose flour|all purpose flour]])\n| \u00bd pint (236 ml, 1 cup) [[Beer|beer]] or [[Lager|lager]], or \u00bd pint (236 ml, 1 cup) cold water\n| &#189; teaspoon [[Baking powder|baking powder]]\n| extra [[Flour|flour]] to dust the [[Fish|fish]]\n}}\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| Start heating the [[Oil|oil]]. This recipe is intended for fast cooking in very hot [[Oil|oil]].\n| Get the [[Batter|batter]] ingredients ready to mix.\n| [[Microwave]] the [[Fish|fish]], to ensure that the inside is hot. Flip the [[Fish|fish]] as you [[Microwave|microwave]] it. When done, the fish should be hot and should look half-cooked.\n| Mix the [[Flour|flour]], [[Egg white|egg white]], and [[Beer|beer]].\n| Pat a [[Fish|fish]] dry with a [[Paper towel|paper towel]], then lightly dust it with [[Flour|flour]] to ensure that it is really dry.\n| [[Dip]] the [[Fish|fish]], and your [[Hand|hand]], into the [[Batter|batter]].

Turn the [[Fish|fish]] over as it cooks.\n| Remove the [[Fish|fish]] when it looks good, then serve it immediately.\n}}\n===Recipe source===\n* [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cookbook:Fried_Fish Wiki Cookbook]\n===See also===\n{{SeeAlso-chips}}\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Historic recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Cooking with beer]]\n[[Category:Fish recipes]]\n[[Category:Freshwater fish recipes]]\n[[Category:Sea fish recipes]]\n[[Category:Deep fried]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#fish #beerbatteredfriedfish #flour #batter #beer #hand #microwave #eggwhite #fried #canolaoil #groundnutoil </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
