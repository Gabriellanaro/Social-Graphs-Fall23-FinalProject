It's easier to 'stuff' the egg.\n\nThe [[Bramblebee farm]] Scotch eggs are really easy to make at home - if you can't get a tube of [[Bramblebee farm]] sausage meat, you can always remove the sausage meat from normal sausages.  You'll need about 180g of meat for each Scotch egg.\n\nOnly use small or medium sized [[eggs]] or you won't have enough sausage meat to cover the Scotch eggs.\n\nThese don't need to be coated with anything providing you cook them on [[greaseproof paper]].  Or you could sit them on a patch of [[breadcrumbs]] or a square of bread.\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| A tube of [[Bramblebee Farm]] Lincolnshire sausage meat - ''about 975g''.\n| 5 small or medium [[Free range eggs|free range eggs]] - '''ensure the [[Eggs|eggs]] are at least 4 days old or you will be unable to peel them easily'''.\n}}\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n\n* Add the [[Eggs|eggs]] to a pan of warm water and bring to the [[Boil|boil]].  Once the water is boiling, time the eggs for exactly 5 minutes.  Remove the pan from the heat and allow to cool.\n* Peel the [[Hard-boiled eggs|hard-boiled eggs]] using a teaspoon.  Doing this under a trickle of water sometimes makes the task a little easier.\n* Preheat your [[Oven|oven]] to 180\u00b0 C (350\u00b0 F - gas 4), [fan oven 160\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]\n\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Bramblebee Farm Scotch egg ingredients.jpg|970g tube of Bramblebee Farm Lincolnshire sausage meat [\u00a33.50 - March 2018] & six local eggs\nImage:Hard boiled eggs on sausage meat patties.jpg|Press the sausage meat out into round-ish patties and place the eggs in the middle\nImage:Forming Bramblebee Farm Scotch eggs with your hands.jpg|Form the sausage meat with your hands\nImage:Forming the Bramblebee Farm Scotch eggs with your hands.jpg|Work the meat around the egg\nImage:Bramblebee Farm Scotch eggs - ready to cook.jpg|Ready to cook\nImage:Bramblebee Farm Scotch eggs - cooked.jpg|Cooked, don't worry if they split a little, they'll still taste great\n</gallery>\n\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| If you are going to add any flavourings to the [[Sausage meat|sausage meat]], do this now.\n| Divide the sausage meat into 5 equal portions and press each portion into a round 'burger-type' pattie, about 13 cm [5 inches] in diameter.\n| Place a [[Hard-boiled egg|hard-boiled egg]] in the centre of the pattie and work it into a ball, ensuring there is no ''seam''.\n| Place the [[Eggs|eggs]] on o non-stick [[Baking tray|baking tray]] or a [[Baking|baking]] tray covered with [[Grease-proof paper|grease-proof paper]].\n| [[Bake]] in the [[Oven|oven]] for 35 minutes, turning once if you get the chance.\n| Allow to cool and serve.\n}}\n===Variations===\nRoll in with [[Breadcrumbs|breadcrumbs]], [[Poppy seeds|poppy seeds]] or [[Sesame seeds|sesame seeds]] before cooking.\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Snacks and light bites]]\n[[Category:Starters]]\n[[Category:Beef recipes]]\n[[Category:Egg recipes]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:Pork recipes]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#bramblebeefarmscotcheggs #eggs #bramblebeefarm #breadcrumbs #poppyseeds #bakingtray #miseenplace #sausagemeat #baking #greaseproofpaper #sesameseeds </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
