Not wanting to compromise on the pulled pork I'm not making any attempt to use the rind as crackling.\n\nThis really is best if it can [[Marinate|marinate]] for 8 hours before the cooking.  Just make sure that you plan this one well ahead.\n\nThe trick to this recipe is cooking it on a low heat for 8 hours and making sure it does not dry out.\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| 1.2 kg [[Bramblebee farms|bramblebee farms]] Old Spot [[Pork|pork]] joint, not rolled\n}}\n====for the marinade====\n{{RecipeIngredientsNB\n| 300 ml [[Guinness]]\n| 1 whole bulb of garlic, that's about 8 cloves of garlic, peeled and crushed\n| 50 ml [[Olive oil|olive oil]]\n| 30 ml [[Worcestershire sauce]]\n| [[Juice]] of 1 [[Lemon|lemon]]\n| 1 tablespoon [[Black treacle|black treacle]]\n| 1 teaspoon [[Curry paste|curry paste]]\n| 3 teaspoon sweet [[Paprika|paprika]]\n| 1 teaspoon [[Smoked paprika|smoked paprika]]\n| 2 [[Bay leaves|bay leaves]], crumpled\n| Bunch of [[Sage leaves|sage leaves]], picked\n| A few pinches of fresh [[Thyme leaves|thyme leaves]] \n| Good pinch of [[Salt|salt]]\n| Good pinch of [[Freshly ground black pepper|freshly ground black pepper]]\n}}\n====for ''the bed''====\n{{RecipeIngredientsNB\n| 1 [[Red onion|red onion]], peeled and sliced\n| Skin of 1 [[Lemon|lemon]] torn into pieces\n| 1 peeled, cored and sliced bramley [[Apple|apple]]\n| Bunch of [[Sage leaves|sage leaves]], picked\n}}\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n\n* Cut a few slashes in the rind so the [[Marinade|marinade]] can penetrate the [[Meat|meat]] from both sides\n* Mix the [[Marinade|marinade]] ingredients together and stir well.\n* Add to a large [[Lock&lock box|lock&lock box]] together with the unrolled [[Pork|pork]], pop the lid on, shake really well and leave in the [[Fridge|fridge]] for 8 hours or mare, shaking and inverting now and again to get an even [[Marinade|marinade]].\n\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Bramblebee Farms Old Spot slow roast pork roughly shredded.jpg|Removed from the roasting tray and roughly shredded\nImage:Bramblebee Farms Old Spot slow roast pork after seven hours.jpg|After seven hours of slow roasting\nImage:Marinaded Bramblebee Farms Old Spot slow roast pork.jpg|Marinaded and ready to slow roast\nImage:Bed for Bramblebee Farms Old Spot slow roast pork.jpg|Onion slices, apple slices and herbs make a good bed for the pork\n</gallery>\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| Preheat the [[Oven|oven]] to 140\u00b0 C (257\u00b0 F - gas 1), [fan oven 120\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour] before you begin cooking\n| Place the ''bed'' items evenly in a large [[Roasting tray|roasting tray]]\n| Join 2 large sheets of [[Tin foil|tin foil]] to make an air-tight seal so they will cover the [[Roasting tray|roasting tray]] so the joint does not dry out\n| Lay the Old Spot [[Pork|pork]] joint on top of the ''bed'', rind-side up\n| Loosely cover the [[Roasting tray|roasting tray]], rolling the [[Foil|foil]] around the edges to the [[Steam|steam]] does not escape\n| [[Roast]] for 7 hours.  [[Baste]] at least three times, replacing the [[Foil|foil]] everytime\n| After the seven hours, remove the meat from the roasting tray and place on a cutting board, remove and discard the rind and any large pieces of fat.  Roughly shred the pork.\n| From the gravy, discard the lemon, most of the onion slices and any wood herbs.  Use a potato masher to mash the apple and any remaining onion.\n| Pop the pork back into the gravy and shred more finely with a pair of forks\n| Cover and return to the oven for the final hour, then serve with as much gravy as you need\n}}\n\n===Serving suggestions===\nThis works equally well as a hot meal with [[Roast potatoes|roast potatoes]] and [[Vegetables|vegetables]] as it does warm, with a [[Salad|salad]] and [[Pitta breads|pitta breads]].\n\nCover any leftovers with the [[Gravy|gravy]] and [[Refrigerate|refrigerate]] once cooled.
