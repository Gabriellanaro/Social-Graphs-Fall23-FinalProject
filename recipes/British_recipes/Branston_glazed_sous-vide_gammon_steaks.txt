To be fair, it's not really a glaze, more of a flavouring.  The gammon was sweet all the way through and not a bit salty.\n\nThe times and temperatures are fairly flexible providing the gammon reaches the safe temperature of 62 \u00b0C (145 \u00b0F): [[Safe minimum cooking temperatures]]\n\nThe the flavourings again are also flexible.  I chose [[Branston pickle|branston pickle]] and [[Apple sauce|apple sauce]] as they were to hand - and an excellent choice though I say so myself!\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| 2 x 200g [[Gammon steaks|gammon steaks]]\n| 2 tablespoons [[Branston pickle|branston pickle]]\n| 2 tablespoons [[Apple sauce]]\n| Pinch of [[Taste Sensation Lime Juice Powder]] (or teaspoons [[Lime juice|lime juice]])\n}}\n\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| Add the [[Gammon steaks|gammon steaks]], [[Branston pickle|branston pickle]], [[Apple sauce|apple sauce]] and [[Lime juice|lime juice]] to a [[Sous Vide|sous vide]] [[Vacuum bag|vacuum bag]]\n| [[Vacuum seal]] the bag and squish the flavourings around to coat the [[Gammon steaks|gammon steaks]]\n| Cook [[Sous-vide]] for 6 hours at 67\u00b0C [152.6\u00b0F]\n| You could use the liquid for a [[Sauce|sauce]], but we found the steaks had enough flavour already.\n| Discard the liquid and serve the [[Gammon steaks|gammon steaks]]\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe with [[Roast potatoes|roast potatoes]], [[Cauliflower|cauliflower]] and [[Carrots|carrots]] and a [[Cheese sauce|cheese sauce]] to pour over the [[Vegetables|vegetables]].\n===Variations===\nThis works equally well with the standard round 125g [[gammon steaks]].\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:Pork recipes]]\n[[Category:Sous vide recipes]]\n[[Category:Sous vide cooking]]\n{{Template:Sous Vide, Smoking and Curing UK}}\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:12032020'>#gammonsteaks #applesauce #branstonpickle #limejuice #britishrecipes #cauliflower #vacuumbag #sousvide #branstonglazedsousvidegammonsteaks #meatrecipes #vacuumseal</code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
