It's an economical and fairly healthy way to use one [[Chicken breast|chicken breast]] to serve two (or more) people.\n\nIn America I believe this is confusingly as ''Chicken Fried Steak''!\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| 1 large [[Chicken breast|chicken breast]] - if you can leave it partly [[Frozen|frozen]], it slices easily.\n| 1 [[Egg|egg]], beaten\n| 6 tablespoons of [[Panko]] [[Breadcrumbs|breadcrumbs]] - or make your own from leftover stale [[Bread|bread]]\n| 1 teaspoon of [[Dried|dried]] [[Rosemary|rosemary]]\n| [[Sea Salt|sea salt]] and [[Freshly ground black pepper|freshly ground black pepper]]\n| 2 tablespoons of [[Olive oil]]\n}}\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n\n* Add 2 tbs of [[Olive oil|olive oil]] to a large [[Frying pan|frying pan]] and place over a medium heat\n\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n|  \n| One large [[Chicken breast|chicken breast]], leave part [[Frozen|frozen]] so it slices easily and neatly.  Lay the [[Chicken|chicken]] breast on a chopping board and put flat of [[Hand|hand]] on the top and carefully slice in slices just under 1cm thick.\n| Beat the [[Egg|egg]] well and pour onto a small plate\n| Mix the [[Breadcrumbs|breadcrumbs]], [[Dried|dried]] [[Rosemary leaves|rosemary leaves]], [[Salt|salt]] and [[Black pepper|black pepper]] together and tip onto another small plate.\n| One by one, [[Dip|dip]] the slices in the [[Egg|egg]] mixture and then onto the [[Breadcrumbs|breadcrumbs]], pressing down so they stick well.\n| Pop the [[Breaded|breaded]] [[Chicken|chicken]] slices into the hot pan and [[Fry|fry]] for a few minutes a side.\n| Because the [[Chicken|chicken]] is sliced so thinly, the chicken is cooked once the [[Breadcrumbs|breadcrumbs]] are [[Browned|browned]].\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe with [[Chips|chips]] and [[Salad|salad]] or [[Mashed potato]] and [[Vegetables|vegetables]].\n\nMaureen especially likes the original Bisto [[Gravy|gravy]] on hers!\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Snacks and light bites]]\n[[Category:Egg recipes]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:Poultry recipes]]\n[[Category:Cookery cheats]]\n[[Category:Pan fried]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#breadcrumbs #egg #chicken #chickenbreast #dried #breadedchickenslices #frozen #oliveoil #bread #panko #browned </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
