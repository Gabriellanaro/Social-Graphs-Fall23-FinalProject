The ingredients for butterscotch are similar to toffee; the major difference is that the sugar is boiled to the [[soft crack stage]] for butterscotch and the [[hard crack stage]] for toffee. Butterscotch sauce is often made into a syrup, which is used as a topping for ice cream (particularly sundaes).\n\nA [[Jam|jam]] making or [[sugar thermometer]] is required for this recipe.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 450 g (1 lb) of [[Granulated sugar|granulated sugar]]\n| 150 ml (1/4 pint) of water\n| 90 g (3 oz) [[Butter|butter]], preferably unsalted\n| 1 teaspoon [[Lemon juice|lemon juice]]\n| &#188; teaspoon [[Cream of tartar|cream of tartar]]\n| &#188; teaspoon [[vanilla essence]] or [[vanilla extract]]\n| A little [[Oil|oil]] for greasing\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Grease a shallow 28 cm x 18 cm (11\" x 7\") [[baking tray]]\n| Add the water and [[Lemon juice|lemon juice]] to a heavy-based pan and warm on a low heat\n| Add the [[Sugar|sugar]] and stir until it has completely dissolved.
