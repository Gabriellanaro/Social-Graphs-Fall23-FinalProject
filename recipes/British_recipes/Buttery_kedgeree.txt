Then it was commonly eaten at breakfast time. It's a bit much for breakfast but it makes a superb evening meal. This recipe is based on Delia Smith's famous buttery kedgeree recipe.\n\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 225 ml [[basmati rice]]\n| 450 ml of the water that the fish was cooked in\n| 700g [[smoked haddock]], [[smoked basa]] or [[hoki]] fillets\n| 110g [[butter]]\n| 1 [[onion]], chopped finely\n| &#189; to &#190; teaspoon [[harissa paste]], [[curry powder]] or [[curry paste]] ( vindaloo paste gives a unique flavour for the hot-heads!)\n| 4 hard boiled [[eggs]], peeled and quartered\n| 4 tablespoons chopped [[parsley]]\n| Juice of 1 [[lime]] or [[lemon]]\n| Sea [[salt]] and freshly ground [[black pepper]]\n| 1 tablespoon chopped [[chives]] to garnish\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Rinse the rice in a sieve for 1 minute under cold running water to remove the excess starch and leave in a colander to drain\n| Put the fish fillets in a pan and cover with 570 ml cold water.  You can leave the skins on as they will fall off later anyway\n| Bring the fish to the boil and simmer for 8 minutes\n| Reserve 450ml of the haddock water in a [[measuring jug]]\n| Place the [[haddock]] in a covered bowl and keep warm\n| Using the same pan, melt 55g of the [[butter]] and soften the [[onions]] for 6 minutes.  Don't brown them\n| Mix in the [[curry paste]] and cook for a few seconds, stirring well\n| Stir in the rice and add the reserved haddock water\n| Once it reaches a simmer, give it a quick stir to lift any rice that has stuck to the base of the pan, cover with a layer of [[tin foil]] and then put on the pan lid so you have a really good seal\n| Simmer for 15 minutes then remove from the heat\n| Remove the skin from the fish and flake it into the rice using a fork\n| Add the hard boiled eggs, remaining [[butter]], [[parsley]], [[lemon]] juice and season with [[salt]] and [[black pepper]]\n| Cover the pan with tin foil, replace the lid and gently heat for 5 minutes.  Don't be tempted to stir it or lift the lid until then\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\n\nGarnish with chopped [[chives]] and serve immediately.\n\n===Chef's note===\n\nIf you and your partner both cook, this recipe, a glass of wine and some good music is a great way to spend some time together.\n\n==See also==\n\nA baked version with garlic and chili, [[Salmon kedgeree]] and [['Greasy spoon' kedgeree]] which speaks for itself.\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes|Kedgeree]]\n[[Category:Breakfast recipes]]\n[[Category:Fish recipes|Kedgeree]]\n[[Category:Sea fish recipes|Kedgeree]]\n[[Category:Indian recipes|Kedgeree]]\n[[Category:Main courses|Kedgeree]]\n[[Category:Rice recipes|Kedgeree]]\n[[Category:Spicy recipes|Kedgeree]]\n[[Category:British recipes|Kedgeree]]\n[[Category:Favourite recipes|Kedgeree]]\n[[Category:Boiled or simmered]][[Category:Poached]]\n\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#butterykedgeree #butter #blackpepper #parsley #lemon #chives #currypaste #eggs #unusualrecipes #onions #measuringjug </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
