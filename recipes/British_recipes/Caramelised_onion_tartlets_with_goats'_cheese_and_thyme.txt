'''\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Sift the [[Flour|flour]] into a large bowl, and then add the [[Butter|butter]]. \n| Take a knife and begin to cut it into the [[Flour|flour]] until it looks fairly evenly blended, and then add the [[Parmesan]], [[Mustard|mustard]] and a pinch of [[Cayenne pepper|cayenne pepper]], plus about 1&frac12; tablespoons cold water to make a smooth [[Dough|dough]], before discarding the knife and bringing it together with your fingertips. \n| Then place the [[Dough|dough]] in a plastic food bag and put it into the [[Fridge|fridge]] to rest for 30 minutes. \n| In the meantime, preheat the [[Oven|oven]] to gas mark 4, 350\u00b0F (180\u00b0C).\n| After that, roll it out as thinly as possible, use the cutter to stamp out 24 rounds and line the tins with them. (The [[Pastry|pastry]] will stand proud of the rim of the cups to allow for shrinkage.) \n| Then prick the bases and [[Brush|brush]] with the beaten [[Egg|egg]]. Now [[Bake|bake]] on the middle and top shelves of the [[Oven|oven]] (swapping them over halfway through to ensure even [[Browning|browning]]) for about 10 minutes, or until the [[Pastry|pastry]] is just cooked through, then cool them on a wire rack.\n}}\n'''For the filling.'''\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Melt the [[Butter|butter]] in a large [[Frying pan|frying pan]] and cook the [[Onions|onions]] very gently, uncovered and stirring often, for about 30 minutes, or until they have turned a lovely golden [[Brown|brown]] [[Caramel|caramel]] colour. \n| Then leave to cool and set aside until needed.\n| Now whisk the [[Egg|egg]] with the [[Cream|cream]] and [[Mustard|mustard]] in a jug and add some seasoning. \n| Next, spoon a little of the [[Onion|onion]] mixture into each [[Pastry|pastry]] case, spread it out evenly and pour the [[Egg|egg]] mixture over. \n| Cut each [[Cheese|cheese]] log into 12 thin slices (wiping the knife between slices to cut more cleanly; the cheese is quite soft, so you may have to reshape a few slices into rounds). \n| Place a slice on the top of each tartlet, then top with a sprig of [[Thyme|thyme]] and a sprinkling of [[Cayenne pepper|cayenne pepper]]. \n| [[Bake]] for 20 minutes, or until puffy and golden, swapping the tins again halfway through cooking.\n}}\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:British Onions recipes]]\n[[Category:Recipes from other sites]]\n[[Category:Cheese recipes]]\n[[Category:Pies tarts and flans]]\n[[Category:Snacks and light bites]]\n[[Category:Starters]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n[[Category:Tapas, mezze and antipasti]]\n{{Template:British Onions attribution}}\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#pastry #egg #cayennepepper #butter #caramelisedoniontartletswithgoatscheeseandthyme #thyme #cheese #flour #parmesan #bake #mustardpowder </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
