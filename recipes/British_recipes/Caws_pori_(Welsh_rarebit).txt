Tomorrow I shall be making this for my daughter's breakfast - yes, I know, a day late, but when I thought about it yesterday afternoon, there were no shops open for me to buy the [[Beer|beer]]!\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 225g strong [[Welsh cheese]], such as [[Black bomber cheese|Black bomber cheese]], [[Grated|grated]]\n| 1 tablespoon [[Butter|butter]]\n| 2 teaspoons [[Worcestershire sauce]]\n| 1 teaspoon dry [[Mustard|mustard]]\n| 2 teaspoons [[Flour|flour]]\n| A pinch of [[White pepper|white pepper]]\n| 60ml [[Beer|beer]] \n| 4 large slices of [[Bread|bread]]\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| In a saucepan, mix the first 6 ingredients.\n| Stir in the [[Beer|beer]], but do not make it too wet.\n| Place the pan on a gentle heat, stirring until the [[Cheese|cheese]] has melted and has become a thickish paste.\n| Swivel the mixture around the pan, remove from heat and allow to cool a little.\n| Meanwhile, toast the [[Bread|bread]] on one side only.\n| Spread the mixture over the untoasted side and [[Brown|brown]] under a hot [[Grill|grill]].\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe either as a breakfast dish, a [[Snack|snack]] or as a [[Light lunch|light lunch]] with a side [[Salad|salad]].\n===Variations===\n[[Cheddar cheese]] is often suggested in recipe books as being the best for this dish, so do use it if you are unable to find a suitable hard [[Welsh cheese]].  \nAlso you can substitute [[Milk|milk]] for the [[Beer|beer]].\n===Chef's notes===\nDo not use [[Caerphilly]] (yummy though it is) as it is too crumbly and in any case most [[Caerphilly]] is now made in Somerset!  \nDo not use [[Lager|lager]] - you need [[Bitter|bitter]] really.  If you can find a Welsh one, then so much the better.\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes|Welsh rarebit]]\n[[Category:British recipes|Welsh rarebit]]\n[[Category:Breakfast recipes|Welsh rarebit]]\n[[Category:Snacks and light bites|Welsh rarebit]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes|Welsh rarebit]]\n[[Category:Cheese recipes|Welsh rarebit]]\n[[Category:Grilled, griddled or barbecued]]\n[[Category:Toasted]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#beer #caerphilly #welshcheese #bread #bitter #snack #salad #lightlunch #flour #worcestershiresauce #grated </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
