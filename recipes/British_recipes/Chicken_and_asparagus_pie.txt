If you can't be bothered to make [[Chicken|chicken]] [[Stock|stock]], rather than using a [[Stock cube|stock cube]]  you might be better off cheating and using a good quality tin of chicken & [[Asparagus|asparagus]] or chicken & [[Mushroom|mushroom]] soup.  I would omit the [[Flour|flour]] if you do it this way.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| A few home [[Smoked|smoked]] [[Bacon|bacon]] rashers, chopped - or just nice quality bacon.\n| 500 g ( 1lb 2 oz) [[Chicken|chicken]] breasts, [[Diced|diced]].\n| 1 [[Onion|onion]], peeled and chopped\n| 1 [[Clove|clove]] of [[Garlic|garlic]], peeled and crushed (optional)\n| [[Olive]] [[Oil|oil]] for [[Frying|frying]]\n| 2 tablespoons freshly chopped [[Parsley|parsley]]\n| 8 [[Asparagus|asparagus]] spears, chopped into 2.5 cm (1\") lengths\n| Handful of [[Mushrooms|mushrooms]], brushed clean and sliced\n| 284 ml (1/2 pint) [[Chicken|chicken]] [[Stock|stock]]\n| 2 tablespoons plain [[Flour|flour]]\n| Sea [[Salt|salt]] and freshly milled [[Black pepper|black pepper]]\n| 225g/8oz ready rolled [[Puff pastry|puff pastry]]\n\n}}\n\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n* Preheat the oven to 200\u00b0 C (400\u00b0 F - Gas 6 - Moderately hot)\n** If your electric oven has the options of upper, lower, both elements, use the lower element.\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Take the pack of pastry out of the fridge and allow to reach room temperature before using (step 8)\n| Heat a few tablespoons of [[Olive|olive]] [[Oil|oil]] in a pan or a [[Wok|wok]] and [[Fry|fry]] the [[Onions|onions]] (and [[Garlic|garlic]] if using) for 3 minutes\n| Season the [[Flour|flour]] with [[Salt|salt]] and [[Pepper|pepper]] and toss the [[Chicken|chicken]] pieces in the flour. \n| Add the [[Chicken|chicken]] to the [[Onions|onions]] and [[Brown|brown]], turning often.\n| Arrange the [[Chicken|chicken]], [[Bacon|bacon]], [[Onions|onions]], [[Mushrooms|mushrooms]] and [[Asparagus|asparagus]] in an oven proof dish.\n| Pour the [[Chicken|chicken]] [[Stock|stock]] or soup over the ingredients.\n| Roll out the pastry so it is large enough to cover your dish.\n| [[Brush]] the edge of the dish with water to [[Help|help]] the pastry stick.\n| Trim away any excess and crimp the edge all the way round with the tines/prongs of a fork - I forgot to do this! A pastry wheel or crimper is also good for this eg [http://www.amazon.co.uk/Pastry-15-5cm-Polyamid-Guaranteed-quality/dp/B0030I1XW8/ref=sr_1_25?ie=UTF8&s=kitchen&qid=1280680434&sr=1-25 metal crimper] or [http://www.amazon.co.uk/Pastry-Cutter-Boxwood-Guaranteed-Quality/dp/B003NIGNLQ/ref=sr_1_34?ie=UTF8&s=kitchen&qid=1280680434&sr=1-34 wooden version]\n| Cut a 1cm (&frac12;\") hole in the top to allow [[Steam|steam]] to escape or even better, put in a [[pie funnel]].\n| [[Bake]] for 25 to 30 minutes in the middle of the oven until the pastry is golden [[Brown|brown]].\n| Check after 20 minutes and if the crust looks as though it might be starting to burn, lay a sheet of [[tin foil]] over the top.\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\n\nServe with hot [[Jacket potatoes|jacket potatoes]].\n\n==See also==\n* {{See also - Jointing a chicken}}\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:Poultry recipes]]\n[[Category:Pies tarts and flans]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Favourite recipes]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#chicken #stock #onions #flour #asparagus #chickenandasparaguspie #olive #mushrooms #bacon #garlic #diced </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
