All you need are [[Chicken|chicken]] pieces, a pot of [[Yogurt|yogurt]] and a jar of ready made ''[[Curry paste|curry paste]]''.  I've used vindaloo paste but you could use whatever you fancy.\n\nThe long you can leave the chicken pieces [[Marinading|marinading]], the better it will be.  I try to leave it a few days if I have managed to think that far ahead.\n\nThis will be cooked in an oven but could just as easily be cooked under a [[Grill|grill]], or on a [[barbecue]] grid or hot-plate.\n\nWe have a more authentic [[Chicken tikka|chicken tikka]] recipe here if you want to make it from scratch.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 4 [[Chicken|chicken]] legs and 4 [[chicken]] thighs (or similar selection)\n| 500g pot of [[Natural yogurt|natural yogurt]]\n| 3 tablespoons of your favourite [[Curry paste|curry paste]]\n| [[Lemon juice]] (optional)\n| [[Sea Salt|sea salt]] (optional)\n}}\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Chicken tikka (cheat)_resting.jpg|Rest for 4 minutes then serve\nImage:Chicken tikka (cheat)_ready_to_cook.jpg|After 2 days its ready to cook\nImage:Chicken tikka (cheat)_yogurt_curry_paste.jpg|Add the curry paste to the yogurt\nImage:Chicken tikka (cheat)_cut slashes.jpg|Cut deep slashes into the chicken pieces\nImage:Chicken tikka (cheat)_ingredients.jpg|Chicken tikka, the simplest of ingredients\n</gallery>\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| I like to remove the skin and trim any [[Fat|fat]].  The [[Marinade|marinade]] gets better penetration without the skin on and it's also a little healthier.\n| Cut 3 or 4 deep slashes down to the bone on each piece.  This ensures really good coverage of the [[Marinade|marinade]].\n| Optionally you can [[Marinade|marinade]] the [[Chicken|chicken]] pieces in [[Lemon juice|lemon juice]] and a good pinch of [[Salt|salt]] for a few hours before adding the [[Yogurt|yogurt]] [[Marinade|marinade]].  This [[Tenderise|tenderises]] the chicken.\n| Mix 2 to 3 tablespoons of your favourite [[Curry paste|curry paste]] into about two thirds of the [[Yogurt|yogurt]].  You don't need any more yogurt for this recipe so it leaves a little spare to make a [[Dip|dip]] or dressing to go with the [[Chicken|chicken]] pieces.\n| Add the [[Chicken|chicken]] pieces and the [[Marinade|marinade]] to a [[Lock and Lock]] style box.  replace the lid and shake like mad.\n| [[Refrigerate]] for a few days if possible shaking it now and then.\n| When you are ready to cook them, preheat the [[Oven|oven]] to 220\u00b0 C (425\u00b0 F - gas 7), [fan oven 200\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]\n| Cook on a grid over a foil-lined oven tray at the top of the [[Oven|oven]] for about 25 to 30 minutes, turning once. Check the chicken is properly cooked, rest for 4 or 5 minutes then serve.\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe with [[Plain rice|plain rice]], a simple [[Green salad|green salad]] and the remaining [[Yogurt|yogurt]] as a [[Dip|dip]].\n===Variations===\nStart with this [[Cheat|cheat]] recipe and tailor it to your liking by adding extra [[Garlic|garlic]], [[Chillies|chillies]], [[Ginger|ginger]], [[Herbs|herbs]] and [[Spices|spices]].  I'm sure that you get the idea.\n==See also==\n* [[Chicken tikka]]\n* [[Chicken tikka masala]]\n* {{See also - Jointing a chicken}}\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Indian recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Spicy recipes]]\n[[Category:Poultry recipes]]\n[[Category:Barbecue recipes]]\n[[Category:Cookery cheats]]\n[[Category:Student recipes]]\n[[Category:Marinaded]][[Category:Grilled, griddled or barbecued]][[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#chicken #marinade #yogurt #currypaste #chickentikka #lemonjuice #dip #greensalad #naturalyogurt #barbecue #marinading </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
