[[Vodka]] doesn't have much of a taste, so it is nice to have some to [[Hand|hand]] which is already spiced and therefore there is no need to add [[Tabasco]].\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| 500ml [[Vodka|vodka]]\n| 1 teaspoon [[Fenugreek seeds|fenugreek seeds]]\n| 1 teaspoon [[Cumin seeds|cumin seeds]]\n| 1 [[Cinnamon stick|cinnamon stick]]\n| [[Dried chillies]] to taste - I used 5 small ones.  Remember you need to be able to get them back out of the bottle!\n| 3 cardamon pods slightly bruised\n}}\n\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| Put all of the [[Spices|spices]] into a clean, sterlised bottle.\n| Top up with [[Vodka|vodka]], leaving a gap at the top to allow room for shaking.\n| Shake the bottle from time to time and it should be ready in two months, or a little less.\n| It will keep for up to one year.\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nMake a Bloody Mary with [[Tomato juice|tomato juice]], a little [[Lemon juice|lemon juice]] and [[Celery salt|celery salt]]\n===Chef's notes===\nIt is better to use too many [[chillies]] than too few.  If it ends up too spicy, you can always add more [[Vodka|vodka]] to tone it down a bit\n===Recipe source===\n\n* Based on a recipe by Nigella Lawson\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Drink and beverage recipes]]\n[[Category:Alcoholic beverages]]\n[[Category:Spicy recipes]]\n[[Category:Chilli pepper recipes]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n[[Category:Uncooked]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#chillivodka #vodka #spirits #hand #chillies #lemonjuice #cuminseeds #spices #driedchillies #tomatojuice #tabasco </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
