I used [[Panko]] [[Breadcrumbs|breadcrumbs]] and [[Fresh herbs|fresh herbs]], but a few tablespoons of [[Stuffing|stuffing]] would work just as well.\n\nBe careful how much you make up as there's not much room in small [[Peppers|peppers]], large ones would be better on reflection.\n\nWe've done this for two people, but I imagine we will eat all of the cheesy, meaty stuffing but we won't eat all of the [[Peppers|peppers]], our [[Chickens|chickens]] can have what we don't eat!\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| 4 [[Sweet peppers|sweet peppers]] sliced in half, lengthways\n| Try to retain some of the [[Pepper|pepper]] around the stalk area or you [[Stuffing|stuffing]] will leak out\n| 400g pack of Morrison's [[Diced|diced]] [[Chorizo|chorizo]]\n| 1 [[Mozzarella|mozzarella]] ball, torn into shreds\n| 50g [[Grated|grated]] or sliced [[Gruyere|gruyere]], or [[Cheese|cheese]] of your choosing\n| A huge good handful of freshly chopped [[Herbs|herbs]]; [[Parsley|parsley]], [[Thyme|thyme]], [[Sage|sage]], [[Chives|chives]], [[Chive|chive]] flowers\n| A tablespoon of [[Cornmeal|cornmeal]] to absorb some of the [[Fat|fat]]\n| A pinch of [[Salt|salt]] and [[Pepper|pepper]]\n}}\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n* Preheat your [[Oven|oven]] to 220\u00b0 C (425\u00b0 F - gas 7)\n* Squeezed and drain the mozzarella in a [[Sieve|sieve]] for an hour or two.  If you don't do this, the mixture will be too wet.\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| Mix all of the [[Stuffing|stuffing]] ingredients together in a large bowl, mixing really well\n| [[Spray]] the base of your [[Baking tray|baking tray]] with [[Olive oil|olive oil]]\n| Stuff the halved [[Peppers|peppers]] with the mixture\n| Place the [[Peppers|peppers]] on the greased tray\n| Cover with [[Tin-foil|tin-foil]] and [[Bake|bake]] for 1 hour\n| Remove the [[Tin-foil|tin-foil]] and [[Bake|bake]] for a further 20 minutes\n| I initially cooked these at a lower temperature and they were a little undercooked so I added some [[Marmite]] stock for the last hour and increased the heat to 220 for the final hour\n}}\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Chorizo and mozzarella stuffed peppers cooked.jpg|Cooked; after a little marmite stock was added for the last hour to steam and assist final cooking\nImage:MorrisonsDicedChorizo.jpg|Morrisons's Diced Chorizo [https://groceries.store.morrisons.com/products/104514145/details buy here]\n</gallery>\n\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe with [[Garlic|garlic]] flavoured  [[Air fried|air fried]] [[Chips|chips]]\n===Variations===\nJust one half per person would make a nice [[Accompaniment|accompaniment]] to any meal.\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Accompaniments]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Cheese recipes]]\n[[Category:Chilli pepper recipes]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:Pork recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegetable recipes]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:12032020'>#peppers #stuffing #chorizoandmozzarellastuffedpeppers #mozzarella #chorizo #bake #diced #chives #chive #cheese #chips</code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
