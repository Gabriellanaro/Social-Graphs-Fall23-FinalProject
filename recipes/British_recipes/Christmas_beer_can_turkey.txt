This is really just a personal aide-memoir, so we can create the same delicious meal again next year!\n\nFor the [[Tex-Mex]] rub and [[Beer-can chicken|beer-can chicken]] recipe, follow the [[Beer-can chicken|original]].\n\nWe had a 5.6 kg Bernard Matthews ([[Frozen|frozen]]) [[Turkey|turkey]].  Fully [[defrosted]].\n\nWe used the small oven of our [[Smeg_Opera_cooker|Smeg Opera cooker]], the contraptions that supper the oven shelves were removed to make available space wider.\n\nRemove any giblets, cut off and discard the [[Parson's nose]].\n\nIt was cooked for 3 hours, 10 minutes at 190\u00b0 C (375\u00b0 F - gas 5) then rested for 30 minutes in the same [[Oven|oven]], with the heat switched off.  Bottom heat *only* was finally used as the [[Ovens|ovens]] top heating element was too close to the top of the bird.\n\nThe [[Grillpro Stainless Steel Chicken Roaster]] was placed in a tray that was kept 1/2 filled with water to prevent burning of the [[Fat|fat]] that dripped and the top of the bird had a 'hat' of [[Tin-foil|tin-foil]].\n\nThe [[Oven|oven]] needed opening every 20 minutes of so, just to release the excess [[Steam|steam]].\n\nThe [[turkey]] was sublime.  We did not have to carve the [[Turkey|turkey]], honestly, I just placed it very heavily on the chopping board and it fell apart, yet the skin was still crispy as you can see. Even my, almost lifetime vegetarian mother was tempted into a lapse.\n===Big bird===\nThis year we had an even larger bird, 6.5kg.  At first it looked as though it would never fir in the oven, however after it was fully de-frosted and a little more of the protruding neck bone was removed, it fitted in - just.  Surprisingly it only needed an extra 20 minutes over a bird 1 kg lighter.  It was sublime.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 5.6 kg whole turkey - fully de-frosted\n| 1 [[Grillpro Stainless Steel Chicken Roaster]]\n| [[Tin foil]]\n}}\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Beer can turkey crusader.jpg|The caped crusader (2011)\nImage:Beer can turkey garlic.jpg|The garlic element (2011)\nImage:Beer can turkey stuffing.jpg|Beer, stuffing and there's the rub (2011)\n</gallery>\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Cooked for 3 hours, 10 minutes at 190\u00b0 C (375\u00b0 F - gas 5)\n| Baste regularly to ensure a crispy skin\n}}\n===Cooking times===\n'''5.6 kg whole [[turkey]] - fully de-frosted'''\n* Wing tips wrapped in [[tin-foil]]\n* A sheet of [[foil]] placed loosely over the top of the bird.\n* Cooked for 3 hours, 10 minutes at 190\u00b0 C (375\u00b0 F - gas 5)\n* Bottom element only to prevent top burning.\n* Rested for 30 minutes (or more) in the same [[Oven|oven]], with the heat switched off.\n'''6.5 kg turkey - fully de-frosted'''\n* Wing tips wrapped in [[tin-foil]]\n* A sheet of [[foil]] placed loosely over the top of the bird.\n* Cooked for 3 hours, 30 minutes at 190\u00b0 C (375\u00b0 F - gas 5)\n* Bottom element only to prevent top burning.\n* Rested for 30 minutes (or more) in the same [[Oven|oven]], with the heat switched off.\n===Cooking without the GrillPro gizmo===\nI've cooked chickens many many times without the gadget without any problems, you just need a method to ensure the bird does not fall over as the flesh cooks and starts to fall away from the bird.  Sitting it upright in a large pan has worked for me before now.\n{{Template:Beercan chicken - See also}}\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]][[Category:British recipes]][[Category:Main courses]][[Category:Poultry recipes]][[Category:Favourite recipes]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#turkey #christmasbeercanturkey #foil #smeg_opera_cooker #frozen #ovens #unusualrecipes #steam #fat #defrosted </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
