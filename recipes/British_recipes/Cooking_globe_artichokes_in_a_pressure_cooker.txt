However, not everyone has a [[Pressure cooker|pressure cooker]], so the next best thing is to [[Steam|steam]] them.  It will take twice as long but the results will be the same.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| 2 [[Globe artichokes|globe artichokes]]\n| A selection of [[Dips|dips]] to serve, eg:\n| ''[[garlic mayonnaise]]''\n| ''[[Lemon butter for fish|lemon butter]]''\n| ''[[Balsamic vinegar and olive oil dip]]''\n| ''[[Sour cream and chive dip]]''\n}}\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Cooking globe artichokes in a pressure cooker recipe.jpg|Remove the hairy centre and you're down to the heart of the choke\nImage:Trim a third of the choke and discard.jpg|Trim a third of the choke and discard\nImage:Globe artichokes peeled.jpg|Peel the stem and trim to 2.5 cm\nImage:Two globe artichokes ready to prepare.jpg|Globe artichokes ready to prepare\n</gallery>\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| Some suggest trimming the spike from each 'leaf' or 'petal', however, on mine there is not much of a spike and that feels rather unnecessary as there is no culinary benefit in doing this\n| Using a [[Speed peeler|speed peeler]], remove the skin from the stem as it can make the choke [[Bitter|bitter]]\n| Trim the stem to about 2.5 cm (1 \")\n| Remove the top third of the [[Artichoke|artichoke]] and discard\n| Add a squeeze of [[Lemon juice|lemon juice]] over the cut area\n| Fill the [[Pressure cooker|pressure cooker]] to just under the trivet with [[Boiling|boiling]] water\n| Smash a [[Clove|clove]] of unpeeled [[Garlic|garlic]] under the flat of a knife and add to the water\n| If you have the squeezed [[Lemons|lemons]] add these together with the [[Artichokes|artichokes]] to the [[Steamer|steamer]] basket and sit on the trivet\n| Cook for 7 minutes on high pressure and let the [[Cooker|cooker]] depressurise naturally\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe warm or cold with a selection of [[dips]].\n\nYou'll need a large bowl for all of the discarded nibbles.\n\nPull each 'leaf' out, dip and pare the buttery part of the leaf with your teeth and then discard it.\n\nWhen you have nibbled all of the leaves, remove the hairy centre and you are at the heart of the choke. You can scoop this out with a spoon or quarter the 'cup', dip and nibble the quarters.\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:French recipes]]\n[[Category:Accompaniments]]\n[[Category:Historic recipes]]\n[[Category:Snacks and light bites]]\n[[Category:Starters]]\n[[Category:Tapas, mezze and antipasti]]\n[[Category:Vegan recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegetable recipes]]\n[[Category:Boiled or simmered]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#pressurecooker #cookingglobeartichokesinapressurecooker #dips #globeartichokes #garlicmayonnaise #steamer #artichoke #bitter #boiling #unusualrecipes #garlic </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
