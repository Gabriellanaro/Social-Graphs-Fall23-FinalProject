Yes, you will need to start this the evening before!  \n\nAlso please read Chef's Notes below, before attempting to make this [[Bread|bread]].\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 225ml sparkling water at room temperature\n| 7g fresh [[Yeast|yeast]]\n| 340g [[Strong white bread flour|strong white bread flour]]\n| 110g strong [[Wholemeal|wholemeal]] [[Bread|bread]] [[Flour|flour]]\n| 5g [[Salt|salt]] \n}}\n===Method===\n\n'''The sponge'''\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Place the water in a jug and add the [[Yeast|yeast]].\n| Weigh out half quantities of each of the [[Flours|flours]] (170g white and 55g wholemeal) and place in a large bowl.\n| Once the [[Yeast|yeast]] has dissolved, empty the jug into the bowl with the [[Flour|flour]].  Do not add [[Salt|salt]] at this stage!\n| Beat into a thick [[Batter|batter]], preferably using your [[Hand|hand]], but a whisk would be fine.\n| Cover with [[Clingfilm|clingfilm]] and keep at room temperature overnight.  \n}}\n'''The [[Dough|dough]]'''\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Mix the remaining [[Flour|flour]] and the [[Salt|salt]] into the sponge to form a fairly stiff, but not too stiff, [[Dough|dough]].\n| Allow to rest, covered for 10 minutes\n| Knead for about 15 minutes or until the [[Dough|dough]] quickly springs back when poked.\n| Form into a ball, place in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with [[Clingfilm|clingfilm]] and allow to prove for about an hour.\n| Knock back and repeat steps 3 and 4.\n}}\n'''Shaping'''\n{{RecipeMethod\n| [[Knock back]] the [[Dough|dough]], weigh it, and break off a piece which is rather under a third of the weight of the whole.\n| Roll each piece into a ball, turning the folds underneath .\n| Leave each piece to rise separately, covering each one with a large upturned bowl, for 45 minutes.  It is better to allow the larger piece to rise on the [[Baking|baking]] tin or stone on which it will be [[Baked|baked]].\n| Carefully flatten the top of the bottom piece and using a sharp knife or [[Grignette|grignette]], cut a 4cm cross in the middle.\n| Flatten the bottom of the topknot and moisten the bottom with some water.\n| Place in the centre of the larger piece of [[Dough|dough]].\n| Using the handle of a wooden spoon, make a hole through the centre of the topknot down into the body of the bottom piece.\n| If you wish to slash the bread, do so at this stage.\n| Cover with a [[Tea towel|tea towel]] and leave to prove for a further 10 minutes.\n}}\n'''[[Baking]]'''\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Carefully put the [[Bread|bread]] onto the lowest rack in the [[Oven|oven]] and switch it on now, setting it at 230\u00b0 C (450\u00b0 F - gas 8), [fan oven 210\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour].\n| [[Bake]] for about 30 minutes, then reduce the heat to 200\u00b0 C (400\u00b0 F - gas 6), [fan [[Oven|oven]] 180\u00b0C] for the remaining 10 minutes.\n| Remove from [[Oven|oven]] and allow to cool on a wire rack.\n}}\n===Chef's notes===\nMaking a sponge first encourages the [[Yeast|yeast]] to act vigorously without the hindrance of [[Salt|salt]], which is why the salt is only added at the [[Dough|dough]] stage.\n\nIf you find the sponge [[Fermenting|fermenting]] too rapidly, [[Refrigerate|refrigerate]] whilst you are in bed and first thing in the morning, put it back in the kitchen for a while to come back to room temperature.\n\nThe process of using the end of a wooden spoon to make a hole in the [[Bread|bread]], is known as 'bashing' and is done to join the top and bottom halves of the loaf.\n\nThe reason the [[Oven|oven]] is not switched on until the loaf is in it is that it will have a chance to expand further and recover from its 'bashing'.\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Bread and baking]]\n[[Category:Vegan recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes]][[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#dough #yeast #bread #cottageloaf #flour #baking #clingfilm #knockback #wholemeal #batter #refrigerate </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
