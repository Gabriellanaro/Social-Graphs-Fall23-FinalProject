Both recipes are an ideal way to use up [[Courgettes|courgettes]].  They are best when about 15 cm (6 in). At this size they still have a lovely shine - once the surface turns matt they should really be treated as [[Marrows|marrows]].\n\nTo shred the [[Courgette|courgette]] ([[Zucchini|zucchini]]) into '[[Spaghetti|spaghetti]]' I found the [[Oxo Good Grips Julienne peeler]] to be the quickest and simplest way.  With the strips of courgette this thin, they can be cooked in a few minutes.\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| 1 medium [[Onion|onion]], peeled and sliced\n| 3 [[Fat|fat]] [[Cloves of Garlic, peeled and crushed|cloves of garlic, peeled and crushed]]\n| 4 tablespoons [[Olive oil|olive oil]]\n| big pinch of [[Freshly ground black pepper|freshly ground black pepper]]\n| 3 or 4 small [[Courgettes|courgettes]], trimmed (topped and tailed)\n| 1 tablespoon fine [[Salt|salt]]\n| 100g [[Jarlsberg]] cheese or your strong cheese of choice\n| 6 tablespoon of good [[Tomato sauce|tomato sauce]] (I've used some of my [[Tomato sauce for pizza]])\n| [[Salt]] to taste\n| Freshly picked [[Tomatoes|tomatoes]] to garnish ([[Sungold|sungold]])\n}}\n\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| Shred the [[Courgettes|courgettes]] into [[Spaghetti|spaghetti]] with the [[Oxo Good Grips Julienne peeler]]\n| To reduce the water content of the [[Courgette|courgette]], add the strips to a [[Sieve|sieve]] with 1 tablespoon fine [[Salt|salt]] and leave to drain while the [[Onions|onions]] cook. \n| Add the [[Olive oil|olive oil]] to a pan or a [[Wok|wok]] together with a big pinch of [[Salt|salt]] and [[Stir fry|stir fry]] the leeds for 3 or 4 minutes\n| Add the [[Crushed garlic|crushed garlic]] and [[Saute|saute]] for no more than a minute, stirring often.\n| Rinse the [[Salted|salted]] [[Courgette|courgette]] [[Spaghetti|spaghetti]] under cold running water and dry in a [[Salad spinner|salad spinner]]\n| Toss the [[Courgette|courgette]] strips into the [[Onions|onions]] and mix well\n| [[Stir fry]] for 3 or 4 minutes - if you like your [[Courgettes|courgettes]] really well cooked, pop a lid on the pan as that helps to [[Steam|steam]] them\n| Heat the [[Tomato sauce|tomato sauce]] and spread on the base of the serving plates -  a few seconds in the [[Microwave|microwave]] is an ideal way to do this\n| MIx the [[Grated|grated]] [[Cheese|cheese]] into the cooked '[[Spaghetti|spaghetti]]' toss really well and serve immediately so the cheese melts on the place\n| Garnish with [[Tomatoes|tomatoes]] and serve\n}}\n===Variations===\nI used a small [[Leek|leek]] instead of an [[Onion|onion]] as we have plenty at this time of year so it's nice to use as much of our garden produce as we can!\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:North American recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Snacks and light bites]]\n[[Category:Tapas, mezze and antipasti]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes]]\n[[Category:Cheese recipes]]\n[[Category:Garlic recipes]]\n[[Category:Pasta recipes]]\n[[Category:Squash recipes]]\n[[Category:Pan fried]]\n[[Category:Stir fried]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#courgette #courgettes #spaghetti #onions #oliveoil #onion #tomatoes #pasta #tomatosauce #stirfry #sieve </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
