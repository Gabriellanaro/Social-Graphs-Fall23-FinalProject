When Anne came in with the ingredients, she surprised me with a pack of peeled [[Brown shrimps|brown shrimps]] so I combined the two and made a fabulous pizza.\n\nThe only downside was the amount of liquid in the [[Crabmeat|crabmeat]], added to increase the nett weight rather than for any culinary reason.  It made the [[Pizza|pizza]] a little wet.  Next time I make this I will spin the crabmeat in a [[Salad spinner|salad spinner]] to reduce the amount of liquid.  If you don't have a [[Salad|salad]] spinner just sit the crabmeat in a [[Sieve|sieve]] for 30 minutes.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| 1 portion of [[Pizza dough]] (makes 2 [[Pizzas|pizzas]])\n| About 6 tablespoons of [[Tomato sauce for pizza]] or [[Passata|passata]]\n| 1 small [[Onion|onion]], very finely chopped\n| 90g peeled [[Brown shrimp|brown shrimp]] (1 small pack)\n| 100g white & [[Brown|brown]] [[Crab meat|crab meat]] (1 small pot)\n| 2 balls [[Mozzarella cheese|mozzarella cheese]] torn into small pieces(about 250g in total)\n| [[Chili oil]] to taste\n| [[Sea Salt|sea salt]] and [[Freshly ground black pepper|freshly ground black pepper]]\n}}\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n\n* Preheat the [[Grill|grill]] to high - with a [[Pizza stone|pizza stone]] if you have one\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Pizza mozzarella Brown shrimp and crabmeat added.jpg|Mozarella added...\nImage:Pizza Brown shrimp and crabmeat added.jpg|Base part-baked and brown shrimp and crabmeat added\nImage:Brown shrimp and crabmeat pizza.jpg|The uncooked base with the crabmeat and brown shrimp\n</gallery>\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| Divide the [[Pizza dough|pizza dough]] into two and roll out into two [[Pizzas|pizzas]]\n| Make each [[Pizza|pizza]] individually and place the first one in the [[Oven|oven]] to keep warm whilst the second pizza completes\n| [[Grill]] the [[Pizza|pizza]] for about 2 to 3 minutes per side with no toppings added\n| Removed the part-[[Baked|baked]] [[Pizza|pizza]] and spread with [[Tomato sauce for pizza]] or [[Passata|passata]]\n| Sprinkle with the finely chopped [[Onions|onions]]\n| Add the peeled [[Brown shrimp|brown shrimp]] and cover with the [[Crabmeat|crabmeat]]\n| Arrange the torn [[Mozzarella|mozzarella]] over the [[Seafood|seafood]].
