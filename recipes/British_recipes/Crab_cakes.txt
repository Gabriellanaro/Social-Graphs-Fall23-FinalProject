However, if you want to fiddle about getting the [[Meat|meat]] out of claws etc, then that is fine!\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 225 g white [[Crab|crab]] [[Meat|meat]]\n| 225 g [[Brown|brown]] [[Crab|crab]] [[Meat|meat]]\n| Breadcrumbs from 3 or more thick slices of stale wholemeal [[Bread|bread]], crusts removed.\n| 2 heaped tablespoons [[Mayonnaise|mayonnaise]]\n| 1 tablespoon [[Worcestershire sauce]]\n| 2 heaped teaspoons hot [[English mustard]] or 2 teaspoons of [[mustard powder]], mixed with a little water.\n| [[Flour]] or [[cornmeal]]\n| 2 beaten [[Eggs|eggs]]\n| 12 rounded tablespoons [[Breadcrumbs|breadcrumbs]]\n| 4 tablespoons [[Sunflower oil|sunflower oil]]\n| 50 g [[Butter|butter]]\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Mix the [[Crab|crab]], wholemeal [[Breadcrumbs|breadcrumbs]], [[Mayonnaise|mayonnaise]], [[Worcestershire sauce]] and [[English mustard]] thoroughly in a bowl.\n| Divide the mixture into 6 and form into rounds of about 2 cm thick (see Chef's notes below).\n| Put some [[Flour|flour]] on a plate, pour the [[Egg|egg]] onto another plate and the [[Breadcrumbs|breadcrumbs]] onto a third plate.\n| Dust the [[Crab|crab]] [[Cakes|cakes]] firstly in [[Flour|flour]], then coat in the beaten [[Egg|egg]] and finally in the [[Breadcrumbs|breadcrumbs]].\n| Leave to rest in the [[Freezer|freezer]] for an hour or so.\n| Heat the [[Oil|oil]] and [[Butter|butter]] in a [[Frying pan|frying pan]] to a medium heat and cook the [[Crab|crab]] [[Cakes|cakes]] for about 4 minutes on each side.\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe with [[Tomato sauce|tomato sauce]] and/or [[Salad|salad]].\n===Chef's notes===\nThe consistency of the [[Crab|crab]] [[Cakes|cakes]] should be fairly firm, which is why the [[Bread|bread]] quantity is not specific.  You need to get the mixture so that you can easily shape them without them falling apart.\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes|Crab cakes]]\n[[Category:British recipes|Crab cakes]]\n[[Category:Fish recipes|Crab cakes]]\n[[Category:Main courses|Crab cakes]]\n[[Category:Shellfish recipes|Crab cakes]]\n[[Category:Starters|Crab cakes]]\n[[Category:Pan fried]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#crabcakes #crab #breadcrumbs #cakes #flour #butter #egg #bread #englishmustard #mayonnaise #worcestershiresauce </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
