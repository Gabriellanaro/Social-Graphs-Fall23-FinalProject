This takes a lot longer, however, if you have the time it is well worth the wait.  Most of the time is spent waiting, not doing so it's still an easy meal.\n\nYou don't have to [[Baked potatoes|salt the potatoes]] first, its just that this step removed moisture from the skins to make them extra crispy. The [[Salt|salt]] is washed off so does not make them the least bit salty.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| 2 large [[Baking|baking]] [[Potatoes|potatoes]]\n| 1 x 340 g tin of [[Corned beef|corned beef]]\n| 2 tablespoons [[Olive oil|olive oil]]\n| 1 [[Red onion|red onion]], peeled and thinly sliced\n| 2 [[Cloves of Garlic, peeled and crushed|cloves of garlic, peeled and crushed]], optional\n| 1 tablespoon [[Worcestershire sauce]]\n}}\n''' to serve'''\n{{RecipeIngredientsNB\n| [[Olive oil]]\n| 6 medium [[Tomatoes|tomatoes]]\n| 2 large [[Free range eggs|free range eggs]]\n| [[Salt]] and [[Freshly ground black pepper|freshly ground black pepper]]\n}}\n\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n\n* Salt the Jacket potatoes [[Baked potatoes|as show here]]\n* Preheat the [[Oven|oven]] to 220\u00b0 C (425\u00b0 F - gas 7), [fan oven 200\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\n[[Image:Skins dehydrated after 3 hours.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Salt the potatoes for 2 or 3 hours then rinse the salt off with cold water.
