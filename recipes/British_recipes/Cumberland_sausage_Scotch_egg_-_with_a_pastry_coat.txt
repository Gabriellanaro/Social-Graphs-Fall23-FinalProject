Drain, then cool under cold water and peel carefully.\n| Meanwhile, squeeze the [[Sausage|sausage]] mixture of the skins and mix it together with the [[Onions|onions]] using your hands.\n| Roll out a block of [[Pastry|pastry]] until large enough to cut 3 x 18cm circles (use a good sized [[Cereal|cereal]] bowl or a side plate as a template). Re-roll the trimmings; you should get 4 further circles from each. Prepare 2 [[Baking|baking]] sheets by dusting with a little [[Flour|flour]].\n| Using slightly wet hands, [[Squash|squash]] out an eighth of the [[Sausage|sausage]] mix over each of the rounds of [[Pastry|pastry]], going almost right to the edges. Slightly wet the edges of the pastry. Sit a peeled [[Egg|egg]] in the middle of the sausage, grind over a little [[Salt|salt]] and [[Pepper|pepper]], then pull the sides up over the egg and seal. Crimp the edges and put onto the [[Baking sheet|baking sheet]].\n| [[Bake]] for 25 to 30 minutes until the [[Pastry|pastry]] is golden [[Brown|brown]].\n}}\n===See also===\n* [[Udi's Gluten Free Products|Udi's Gluten Free baking products]]\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Historic recipes]]\n[[Category:Snacks and light bites]]\n[[Category:Starters]]\n[[Category:Tapas, mezze and antipasti]]\n[[Category:Egg recipes]]\n[[Category:Gluten free recipes]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:Pork recipes]]\n[[Category:Debbie&andrew's sausage recipes]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n[[Category:Boiled or simmered]]\n{{Template:DebbieAndAndrew attribution}}\n[[Category:Recipes from other sites]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#pastry #eggs #egg #glutenfree #sausage #bake #baking #piccalilli #flour #onions #cereal </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
