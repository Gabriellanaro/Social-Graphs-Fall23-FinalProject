When you can no longer feel the suet with your fingers, gradually add a few tablespoons of cold water and mix to form a soft but not sticky [[dough]].\n| Adjust the consistency of the dough by adding extra flour or water if required.\n| Divide into 6 to 8 and form into balls\n| Drop then into a stew or casserole about 20 to 30 minutes before the end of cooking\n| Alternatively, [[boil]] in water or [[stock]] for 20 to 30 minutes\n}}\n===Method: Crispy suet dumplings===\n# Preheat the oven to 200\u00b0 C (400 \u00b0F - gas 6)\n# Follow steps above\n# Gently float on top of a stew or casserole\n# Baste with a little of the gravy\n# Bake (uncovered) at the top of the oven for 30 minutes or so - the dumplings should be cooked and crispy on the top\n===Serving suggestions===\nDumpling are really nice, crisped under a grill once they have cooked. Especially [[cheese]] dumplings\n===Variations===\nAdd 2 tablespoons of [[grated]] [[Cheddar cheese]] to make [[cheese]] dumplings\n===Extend the shelf life of shredded suet===\nSuet, once opened, has a very limited shelf life and will go rancid.  Once opened, if you do not need to use the whole packet, freeze the remainder; once properly defrosted it is a good a fresh suet, and it lasts for years in the freezer.\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes|Dumplings]]\n[[Category:Accompaniments|Dumplings]]\n[[Category:Historic recipes|Dumplings]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Student recipes]]\n[[Category:Boiled or simmered]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#dumplings #cheese #selfraisingflour #bicarbonateofsoda #boiledorsimmered #dough #cheddarcheese #shredded #grated #suet #stock </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
