The [[Rest|rest]] of the ingredients were  odds and ends.\n\nI find the [[French]] bottled [[mogettes]] \u00e0 la paysanne to be a little cloying so I tried to adjust this with the [[Creme fraiche|creme fraiche]].  Serving with the [[Steamed broccoli|steamed broccoli]] was almost like a palate cleaner. The result was excellent and will be made again.\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| 1 medium [[Onion|onion]], peeled and chopped\n| 4 [[Cloves of Garlic, peeled and crushed|cloves of garlic, peeled and crushed]]\n| A good pinch of [[Black pepper|black pepper]]\n| 2 tablespoons [[Olive oil|olive oil]]\n| 6 [[Toulouse sausages]], cut in half\n| 850 ml jar of [[mogettes \u00e0 la paysanne]] - not sure if you would find these in the UK but they are very common in mid-France\n| 2 tablespoons of [[Tomato puree|tomato puree]]\n| 2 teaspoons of [[Old India Taco Seasoning]] or [[Tex-Mex seasoning]]\n| 2 tablespoons of ruby [[Port|port]]\n| 5 tablespoons of [[Creme fraiche|creme fraiche]]\n}}\n\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| Add the [[Olive oil|olive oil]] and [[Black pepper|black pepper]] to a [[Dutch Oven|dutch oven]], when hot add the chopped [[Onions|onions]] and the halved [[Toulouse sausages]] and [[Saute|saute]] for 4 minutes\n| Stir in the [[Crushed garlic|crushed garlic]] and [[Saute|saute]] for a minute or so\n| Tip in the mogettes and the [[Taco seasoning]] and [[Tomato puree|tomato puree]] and mix well\n| Bring to a [[Simmer|simmer]], reduce the heat to very low and simmer for about 40 minutes. As you can get quite a lot of [[Steam|steam]] from this you can adjust the consistency to your liking by [[Simmering|simmering]] covered or with the lid half on.\n| When there is about 5 minutes left to go, begin [[Steaming|steaming]] the [[Broccoli|broccoli]].\n| Stir in the [[Port|port]] and [[Creme fraiche|creme fraiche]] and mix well.  Bring back to a [[Simmer|simmer]] and remove from the heat. Ensure the mixture does not [[Boil|boil]]\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe with [[Steamed broccoli|steamed broccoli]] and sliced [[Ciabatta bread|ciabatta bread]]\n===Variations===\nOdd [[Vegetables|vegetables]] can be mixed in too.
