Perhaps this picture will remind me next time!]]\nAnother recipe that has come about as a result of my recent craze, making quiches.  This time I thought I would use some of our Home smoked bacon and fresh eggs from our hens.\n\nI'm using Jus Rol ready made shortcrust pastry and find that 1 500g pack is too much pastry for a (shallow) 10\" [[Push-out flan dish]], so this time I used about half - which means I can make another one tomorrow!\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 250 g (9 oz) from block of ready-made [[shortcrust pastry]]\n| 2 [[free range eggs]], beaten\n| 45 ml (4 tablespoons) of [[milk]]\n| 3 tablespoons of [[mascarpone cheese]]\n| 5 rashers of cooked [[bacon]], [[home smoked bacon]] or [[ham]], chopped into tiny pieces.\n| [[freshly ground black pepper]]\n| Slices of [[tomato]] or [[red pepper]] or [[green pepper]] or a mixture of all to garnish\n\n}}\n\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n* Allow the pastry to get to room temperature before rolling it out.\n\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Preheated the oven to 200\u00b0 C (400\u00b0 F - Gas 6)\n| Roll the pastry and use it to line a greased 20 cm (8\") [[push-out flan dish]]\n| [[Blind baking|Bake blind]] at 200\u00b0 C (400\u00b0 F - Gas 6) for 10 minutes\n| Beat the [[eggs]], [[milk]], [[mascarpone cheese]] and season to taste with [[pepper]] -  [[salt]] won't be needed with the bacon\n| Stir in the bacon pieces\n| Pour the egg and bacon mixture into the blind-baked flan case\n| Decorate with whatever you have to hand, I used half of a [[green pepper]], sliced, but use whatever you have to hand, [[tomatoes]] look and taste are good.\n| Reduce the heat of the oven to 180\u00b0 C (350\u00b0 F - Gas 4)\n| [[Bake]] for a further 40 minutes\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\n\nServe hot or cold\n===Notes===\nOur [[bacon]] is smoked and dried for 4 months so can be eaten without cooking rather like ham. If you're using normal bacon I would cook it first.\n\n{{Quiche - See also}}\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Starters]]\n[[Category:Egg recipes]]\n[[Category:Pies tarts and flans]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#eggandbaconflan #mascarponecheese #bacon #greenpepper #homesmokedbacon #greaseproofpaper #eggs #blindbaking #tomato #tomatoes #ham </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
