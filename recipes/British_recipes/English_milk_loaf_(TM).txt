For those of you in Australia, I found some on E-bay (Australia), but unfortunately they don\u0092t seem to be available in Canada or the USA.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 7g [[Dried yeast|dried yeast]] or 15g fresh\n| 270g [[Milk|milk]]\n| 450g strong [[Bread|bread]] [[Flour|flour]]\n| 1 tablespoon [[Dried|dried]] full-[[Fat|fat]] [[Milk powder|milk powder]]\n\n| 2 tablespoons [[Oil|oil]]\n| &frac12; teaspoon [[Salt|salt]]\n}}\n\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Put the [[Yeast|yeast]] in the bowl with the [[Milk|milk]] '''3 minutes / 37\u00b0 / Speed 1'''\n| Add the remaining ingredients in the order given '''15 seconds / Speed 4'''\n| Then '''2&frac12; minutes / Speed [[Knead]]'''\n| Leave in the bowl until the [[Dough|dough]] is pushing up the MC then '''10 seconds / Speed 4'''\n| Leave to rise again as before (optional)\n| Tip the [[Dough|dough]] out onto a lightly floured surface\n| Lightly, but thoroughly grease the [[Milk|milk]] loaf pan with an [[Oil|oil]] such as [[Groundnut|groundnut]] which is low in monounsaturates and shake over a light dusting of [[Flour|flour]]. \n| Shape the [[Dough|dough]] into a cylinder the same length of the tin. \n| Place the [[Dough|dough]] into the bottom of the tin, engage the tabs and clip the tin together. \n| Set the tin aside in a [[warm place]] to allow the [[Bread|bread]] to rise - watch the [[Dough|dough]] through the small vision hole at the top. \n| Heat the [[Oven|oven]] to 200\u00b0 C (400\u00b0 F - gas 6). \n| As soon as the [[Dough|dough]] can be seen rising towards the hole, [[Bake|bake]] for 30 minutes ([[Fan-assisted oven|fan-assisted oven]]) or 35 minutes ([[Conventional oven|conventional oven]]). \n| Allow the tin to cool for 2-3 minutes before unclipping and turn out onto a [[Cooling rack|cooling rack]].\n}}\n===Recipe source===\n* Adapted for [[Thermomix]] from the recipe supplied with the tin.  You don\u0092t get one now, probably because it was appalling (the quantities were wrong and too small to allow the [[Dough|dough]] to rise to the top of the tin.)\n==See also==\n* [[Milk loaf recipe]]\n* [[English milk loaf]]\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Bread and baking]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes]]\n[[Category:Breadmaker recipes]]\n[[Category:Thermomix recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#dough #thermomix #flour #bread #englishmilkloaf #yeast #driedyeast #coolingrack #warmplace #milkpowder #amazon </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
