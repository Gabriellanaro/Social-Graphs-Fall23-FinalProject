Anitra has, by daughter-proxy, given us a huge pile of [[Jerusalem artichokes]] that I am determined to use.  This shall be the first attempt.\n===Update===\nGerard had something here.  Pretty non-descript, this, even with all the [[Garlic|garlic]] and [[bay leaves]].  Sweet tasting, rather similar to [[parsnip]] or [[sweet potato]], neither of which are my favourites.  These are also quite a fiddle to prepare and there is a fair deal of waste too.  I would feed these to worms. \n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 600 g (1lb 2 oz) [[Jerusalem artichokes]] (peeled weight)\n| A few glugs of [[Olive oil|olive oil]], flavoured with a few good grinds of [[black pepper]].\n| 4 Cloves of [[Garlic|garlic]], peeled and sliced thinly\n| 6 [[Bay leaves|bay leaves]] - you can use less, but if you have a [[Bay|bay]] tree to [[Hand|hand]], why not?  Let's go for big flavour here.\n| 2 tablespoons [[Sherry vinegar|sherry vinegar]]\n| [[Sea Salt|sea salt]] and [[Freshly ground black pepper|freshly ground black pepper]]\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Peel the [[Artichokes|artichokes]] and cut into even side pieces, about the size of halved ping-pong balls\n| Heat a [[Wok|wok]] or [[Frying pan|frying pan]] with a few glugs of [[Olive oil|olive oil]] and [[Saute|saute]] over a fairly high heat until they have golden edges\n| Lower the heat a little, add the [[Garlic|garlic]] and [[Fry|fry]] it off a little\n| [[Deglaze]] the pan with the [[Sherry vinegar|sherry vinegar]], add the [[Bay leaves|bay leaves]], seasoning, cover and cook for 25 to 30 minutes\n| Remove the cover and the [[Bay leaves|bay leaves]], turn up the heat and crisp up the [[Artichokes|artichokes]] for 3 or 4 minutes\n| Season and serve immediately\n}}\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Accompaniments]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegan recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegetable recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes]]\n[[Category:Pan fried]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#bayleaves #garlic #jerusalemartichokes #artichokes #sherryvinegar #oliveoil #sweetpotato #panfried #bay #saute #blackpepper </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
