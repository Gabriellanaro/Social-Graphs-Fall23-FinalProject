It originated in England in the mid 1700s, and it reached its peak of popularity in the early 1900s. The original recipe requires only ginger, sugar, and water, to which is added a gelatinous substance called \"ginger beer plant\" (see below).\n \n[[Fermentation]] over a few days turns the mixture into ginger beer. [[Lemon]] may be added. A simple version of this recipe can be made at home today in which the following is bottled in a 2 litre bottle: [[Grated|grated]] [[Fresh ginger|fresh ginger]], sugar, a small amount of baker's [[Yeast|yeast]], and (optionally) [[Lemon juice|lemon juice]]. \n\nIt is sealed at room temperature for a day or two before refrigerating.\n\nInstead of using the ginger [[Beer|beer]] plant, some other form of live culture may be used to produce [[Fermented|fermented]] ginger beer. This is often baker's or [[Brewer's yeast|brewer's yeast]], but can also be a culture of [[Lactic acid|lactic acid]] bacteria, [[Kefir|kefir]] [[Grains|grains]], or tibicos. [[Ginger]] beer is fizzy due to carbon dioxide. \n\nThe [[Alcohol|alcohol]] content when produced by the traditional process can be high, up to 11%, although it is possible to [[Ferment|ferment]] ginger beer in such a way as to produce little alcohol. Ginger beer may be mixed with beer (usually a British [[Ale|ale]] of some sort) to make one type of shandy, and with Gosling's Black Seal [[Rum|rum]] to make a drink, originally from Bermuda, called a Dark 'N' Stormy. The soda version of ginger beer is the main ingredient in the Moscow Mule cocktail.\n\nThe [[Beverage|beverage]] produced industrially today is often not brewed ([[Fermented|fermented]]). Such ginger [[Beer|beer]] is [[Carbonated|carbonated]] with pressurised carbon dioxide, does not contain [[Alcohol|alcohol]], and is sold as a [[Soft drink|soft drink]]. [[Ginger]] beer is similar to ginger [[Ale|ale]] except that it has a significantly stronger ginger taste, often being described as ginger ale with a kick to it. \n\nIts other distinctive properties include its traditional cloudy appearance, its predominately [[Citrus|citrus]] sour taste base and its spicy ginger bite.\n\nThis recipe is taken from \"Modern practical cooking\" - circa 1900\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 1 gallon [[Boiling|boiling]] water\n| 14 oz loaf [[Sugar|sugar]]\n| 1 [[Lemon|lemon]]\n| &frac34; oz lump of [[Ginger|ginger]], bruised\n| &frac12; oz solid [[Yeast|yeast]]\n| 2 teaspoonfuls of [[Castor sugar|castor sugar]]\n| 1 teaspoonful of [[Cream of tartar|cream of tartar]]\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Wipe the [[Lemon|lemon]] and peel very thinly\n| put the rind in a large jar or pan, and add the lump [[Sugar|sugar]], [[Ginger|ginger]] and [[Cream of tartar|cream of tartar]]\n| Pour [[Boiling|boiling]] water over these ingredients, and stir together. Leave until lukewarm.\n| Mix the [[Yeast|yeast]] and [[Castor sugar|castor sugar]] together until they become liquid, then stir into the other ingredients with the [[Lemon juice|lemon juice]].\n| Partly cover\n| Leave in a warm place for 12 hours\n| Remove the scum, strain the [[Ginger|ginger]] [[Beer|beer]] and bottle\n| Cork the bottles very securely and tie the corks with wire\n| Leave for about 4 to 5 days\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nPour into a glass, being careful to leave the sediment behind\n===Modernising this recipe.===\nI would be inclined to use [[Jaggery|jaggery]] in place of 'lump [[Sugar|sugar]]', or just use [[Brown sugar|brown sugar]] or [[Castor sugar|castor sugar]].\n\nUse a little more than 1/2 a teaspoon of brewers [[Yeast|yeast]] instead of solid [[yeast]].\n\nStore the bottles in a cool place and take very great care when handling or opening.  Even I can remember my Grandfather's legendary tales of ginger beer bottles exploding in the night and setting up a chain reaction.\n{{Template:PeelingGinger}}\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Accompaniments]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Historic recipes]]\n[[Category:Snacks and light bites]]\n[[Category:Sweets and desserts]]\n[[Category:Vegan recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes]]\n[[Category:Uncooked]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#gingerbeer #ginger #beer #yeast #lemon #castorsugar #carbonated #softdrink #ale #boiling #fermented </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
