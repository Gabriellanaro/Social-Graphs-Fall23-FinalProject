This is a treat for my husband who for the best part of the year restricts his consumption of [[saturated fat]].  The recipe is vaguely based on a healthier '''[http://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/9098/sticky-slowroast-belly-of-pork James Martin recipe]'''.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 1.4 kg [[Belly pork|belly pork]], boned and scored\n| 2 teaspoons [[Goose fat|goose fat]]\n| 2 teaspoons green [[Peppercorns|peppercorns]], crushed\n| [[Sea Salt|Coarse sea salt]]\n| 1 teaspoon dried [[thyme]]\n| 3 large [[Onions|onions]], sliced\n| [[Garlic]] to taste, separated, but not peeled\n| 2 tablespoons of extra [[Goose fat|goose fat]]\n\n}}\n\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n* Preheat the [[Oven|oven]] to 180C/fan 160C/gas 4.\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Place the [[Pork|pork]], skin-side up, on a rack in a [[Roasting|roasting]] tin. \n| Smear with 2 teaspoons [[Goose fat|goose fat]], then lightly press on the crushed [[Peppercorns|peppercorns]], a sprinkling of [[Coarse sea salt|coarse sea salt]] and [[thyme]]. \n| Put in the [[Oven|oven]], then cook for 1 hour. \n| Remove from the [[Oven|oven]] and [[Baste|baste]] with the juices. Continue to cook for a further 1&frac12; hours, [[Basting|basting]] every 30 minutes.\n| Put the sliced [[Onions|onions]] and [[Garlic|garlic]] in the [[Roasting|roasting]] tin underneath the [[Pork|pork]]. \n| [[Brush]] 2-3 tablespoons of [[Goose fat|goose fat]] over the [[Pork|pork]], then increase the [[Oven|oven]] to 200C/fan 180C/ gas 6. \n| Cook for a further 30-40 mins, [[Basting|basting]] occasionally. Once cooked and tender (this can be easily tested by piercing the flesh with a knife), remove [[Pork|pork]] from the [[Oven|oven]], then leave to rest for 10-15 mins.\n| While the [[Pork|pork]] is resting, heat the tin on the stove with the [[Onions|onions]], adding 2 tablespoons of water. This will lift any residue from the pan, creating a moist cooking [[Liquor|liquor]]. Season the onions with [[Salt|salt]] and [[Pepper|pepper]], then divide between 6 plates. \n| Carve [[Pork|pork]] into 6 portions, then serve on top of the [[Onions|onions]] and pour over the cooking [[Liquor|liquor]].  Squeeze the [[Garlic|garlic]] over the top.\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe with [[Roast potatoes|roast potatoes]], [[Vegetables|vegetables]] and [[white wine gravy]].\n===Chef's notes===\nIf making in smaller quantities you will need to reduce the cooking times in proportion to the weight of the [[pork]].\n{{Template:ThinkPig}}\n==See also==\n* '''[[Meat cooking time calculator Metric|A comprehensive guide to roast meat cooking times]]''' - give the time you want to carve your roast and we'll give you a timed step by step roasting guide\n* [[Slow roast recipes]]\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes|Pork belly]]\n[[Category:British recipes|Pork belly]]\n[[Category:Main courses|Pork belly]]\n[[Category:Garlic recipes|Pork belly]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes|Pork belly]]\n[[Category:Pork recipes|Pork belly]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#pork #onions #goosefat #goosefatroastedbellypork #garlic #peppercorns #basting #liquor #roasting #thyme #whitewinegravy </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
