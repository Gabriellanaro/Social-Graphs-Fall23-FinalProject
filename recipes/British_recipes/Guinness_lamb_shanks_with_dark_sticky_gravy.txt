This one from Jamie Oliver's new book: \"Jamie's Great Britain\" uses [[Lamb shanks|lamb shanks]]. After 3 hours cooking they just disintegrate and soak up the sticky sweet gravy - wonderful!\n\nI've adapted the recipe for 4 people and like to serve it with [[Squash mash|squash mash]], [[Spring onions|spring onions]] and [[Jamie's mint oil]].\n\nJamie comes up trumps again with this book, a big [[Coffee|coffee]] table hardback, full of neat twists on standard recipes.  It's a bit pricey at \u00a330, but you can probably find a copy for less than a tenner if you shop around: \n*\"Jamie's Great Britain\" - Jamie Oliver: ISBN 978-0718156817\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| [[Olive oil]] for saut\u00e9ing \n| [[Sea Salt|Sea salt]] and [[Freshly ground black pepper|freshly ground black pepper]]\n| 3 [[Red onions|red onions]], peeled and chopped\n| 70g of dried mixed fruit ([[Raisins|raisins]], [[Sultanas|sultanas]] & [[Dried apricots|dried apricots]])\n| 2 heaped tablespoons of chunky [[Marmalade|marmalade]]\n| 1 tablespoon of Heinz [[Tomato sauce|tomato sauce]]\n| 1.5 tablespoons [[Worcestershire sauce]]\n| 200 ml [[Guinness]], [[Porter|porter]] or [[Brown ale|brown ale]]\n| 4 [[Lamb shanks|lamb shanks]]\n| 4 sprigs of fresh [[Rosemary|rosemary]] (see ingredients photo)\n| 500 ml [[Chicken stock|chicken stock]]\n}}\n''' to garnish'''\n{{RecipeIngredientsNB\n| A Large [[Sprig of mint|sprig of mint]] leaves\n| 5 tablespoons of [[Olive oil|olive oil]]\n| 3 large [[Spring onions|spring onions]]\n| 5 tablespoons [[Cider vinegar]]\n| A handful of [[Mint leaves|mint leaves]], picked from the stems\n}}\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Guinness lamb shanks with dark sticky gravy ingredients.jpg|[[Guinness]] [[Lamb shanks|lamb shanks]] with dark sticky [[Gravy|gravy]]; the basic ingredients\nImage:Jamie Oliver's spring onion and cider vinegar dressing.jpg|[[Jamie Oliver's spring onion and cider vinegar dressing]]\nImage:Jamie Oliver's mint oil dressing.jpg|[[Jamie Oliver's mint oil dressing]]\n</gallery>\n===Method===\n'''[[Mint oil]]'''\n''Make this now so it has time to infuse''\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Add the chopped picked [[Mint leaves|mint leaves]] to a [[Mortar and pestle|mortar and pestle]] with a good pinch of [[Sea Salt|sea salt]] and crush well\n| Mix with 5 tablespoons of [[Olive oil|olive oil]], set to one side\n}}\n'''[[Guinness]] [[Lamb shanks|lamb shanks]] in sweet gravy'''\n{{RecipeMethod\n| A a slug of [[Olive oil|olive oil]] to a large metal pan, add a good grind of [[Black pepper|black pepper]], heat the [[Oil|oil]] and add the [[Onions|onions]] and a pinch of [[Salt|salt]].\n| Saut\u00e9 for 5 or 6 minutes until they have take some colour.\n| Lower the heat a little and stir in the stock, [[Guinness]], [[Dried fruit|dried fruit]], [[Marmalade|marmalade]], tomato sauce and [[Worcestershire sauce]] - leave a little Guinness to de-glaze the [[Frying pan|frying pan]] later. \n| Mix well and keep it [[Simmering|simmering]] while you [[Brown|brown]] off the [[Lamb shanks|lamb shanks]]\n| [[Brown]] the [[Lamb shanks|lamb shanks]], two at a time in a large [[Frying pan|frying pan]]. Use a little little [[Olive oil|olive oil]] to start them off.\n| Keep turning them until they have take some colour and add the [[Browned|browned]] shanks to the [[Onions|onions]] when they are done.\n| Add a little more [[Oil|oil]] and saut\u00e9 the [[Rosemary|rosemary]] sprigs, being careful not to burn them.\n| Add the whole [[Rosemary|rosemary]] sprigs to the [[Casserole dish|casserole dish]], de-glaze the pan with the last drop of [[Guinness]] and pour it all into the [[Casserole|casserole]].\n| Place a lid on the [[Casserole dish|casserole dish]] and simmer quite vigorously for about 3 hours. Turn the shanks about halfway through, being careful not to let them break up.\n| Carefully remove the cooked shanks and keep warm.\n| Remove the [[rosemary sprigs]] and discard.\n| Whizz the gravy mixture into a smooth sauce using a [[food processor]] or a [[stick blender]].\n| Return to the heat and reduce the gravy by about half.  This might take up to 15 minutes but it's better to reduce and concentrate the flavour rather than by adding a [[thickening agent]].\n}}\n'''Mashed potatoes'''\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Allow up to 40 minutes to cook your [[Mashed potatoes]]\n}}\n'''Spring onion dressing'''\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Finely chop 3 [[Spring onions|spring onions]], mix with a pinch of [[Salt|salt]] and up to 5 tablespoons [[Cider vinegar|cider vinegar]]\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe on a bed of [[Squash mash|squash mash]], sprinkled with the [[Spring onion|spring onion]] dressing and [[mint oil]], dressed with a sprinkling of [[Mint leaves|mint leaves]].\n===Variations===\nYou can find a variety of [[mashed potato recipes|mashed potato recipes here]], or try [[celeriac mash]] for a change.\n===Chef's notes===\nThe original recipe used 1 litre of stock and 200 ml Guinness (for 6), even so I would think that was too much.  I used a total of 850 ml and that was really more than was needed - it took a vigorous 15 minute reduction to get it any where close to sticky.  \n\nMaking it again, as long as the casserole was not too large, I would sit the shanks thick-side down, add the [[ale]] and then top-up with enough stock to the cover the start of the bone.\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Lamb recipes]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:Stewed, braised or pot roasted]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#lambshanks #guinness #oliveoil #guinnesslambshankswithdarkstickygravy #springonions #rosemary #mintleaves #worcestershiresauce #mintoil #onions #squashmash </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
