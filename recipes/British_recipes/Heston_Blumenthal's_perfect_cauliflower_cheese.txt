Cooking the [[Cauliflower|cauliflower]] in three separate ways, [[Vinaigrette|vinaigrette]], [[Deep fried|deep fried]] and boiled, gives an extra contrast to this dish.\n\nThe cheese sauce is sublime, but the cleverest idea is soaking some of the cauliflower in a vinaigrette.  It adds a fantastic random taste\n\n'''for the [[Cauliflower|cauliflower]]'''\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 50g [[Caster sugar|caster sugar]]\n| 100ml [[White wine vinegar|white wine vinegar]]\n| 1 large [[Cauliflower|cauliflower]], broken into florets and separated into thirds\n| [[Groundnut oil]]\n}}\n'''for the [[Cheese sauce|cheese sauce]]'''\n{{RecipeIngredientsNB\n| 500ml [[Chicken stock|chicken stock]], reduced to 200ml and kept warm\n| 300ml [[White wine|white wine]], reduced to 30ml\n| 120g [[Grated|grated]] gruy\u00e8re [[Cheese|cheese]]\n| 20g [[Cornflour|cornflour]]\n| 20g soft [[Cheese|cheese]]\n| Knob of [[Butter|butter]]\n| Drops of [[Truffle oil|truffle oil]]\n| 25g extra [[Grated|grated]] Gruy\u00e8re [[Cheese|cheese]] or [[Cheddar cheese|cheddar cheese]] for gratinating\n\n}}\n\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n* Reduce the [[White wine|white wine]] from 500 ml to 30 ml, or [[Cheat|cheat]] and use [[Dry sherry|dry sherry]]!\n* Reduce the [[Chicken stock|chicken stock]] from 500 ml to 200 ml\n* Preheat the [[Grill|grill]] to maximum once the [[Cauliflower|cauliflower]] has been cooked\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Using a small pan, stir the [[Sugar|sugar]] into the [[Vinegar|vinegar]] and  bring to the [[Boil|boil]]\n| Put a third of the [[Cauliflower|cauliflower]] florets  into a bowl, pour the [[Vinegar|vinegar]] mix over the florets and [[Refrigerate|refrigerate]] for at least half an hour\n| Fill another small pan &#190; full with [[Groundnut oil|groundnut oil]] and heat over a medium high heat.
