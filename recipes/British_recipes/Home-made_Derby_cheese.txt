However, not having my own [[Cows|cows]], this is not possible, and unless you live near a farm that is registered to supply [[Unpasteurised|unpasteurised]] milk, probably not for you either.  This version is made with [[Pasteurised|pasteurised]] shop bought milk.\n\nThe quantity given will fit a small [[Ascott]] hard [[Cheese mould|cheese mould]] measuring 82 x 82 x 90 mm.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 4 [[Litres|litres]] [[Pasteurised|pasteurised]] full-fat [[Milk|milk]]\n| A small pinch of [[DVI]] or 2 ml [[Liquid starter|liquid starter]]\n| 1.5 ml [[Calcium Chloride|calcium chloride]], mixed with a little cooled, [[Boiled|boiled]] water\n| 1.5 ml [[Rennet|rennet]] (animal or vegetarian), mixed with a little cooled, [[Boiled|boiled]] water\n| [[Salt]]\n| [[Brine]], made with 180 ml [[Salt|salt]] [12 level tablespoons] per 1 litre of water\n\n}}\n\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n* [[Sterilise]] all equipment\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Heat the [[Milk|milk]] slowly, using a [[Double boiler|double boiler]] until it has reach a temperature of 29 [[Degrees|degrees]] C.\n| Stir in the [[DVI]] or [[Liquid starter|liquid starter]] and leave for 15 minutes.\n| Add the [[Calcium Chloride|calcium chloride]] and stir throughly.\n| Stir in the [[Rennet|rennet]], stir and leave in a warm place for 45-60 minutes, until set.\n| [[Cut the curds]] into 1.2 cm cubes and slowly heat, stirring until the temperature reaches 36 [[Degrees|degrees]].  This should take 15 minutes.\n| Allow to settle for 15 minutes.\n| Drain off as much of the [[Whey|whey]] as you can and transfer the [[Curds|curds]] to a piece of [[Cheesecloth|cheesecloth]].\n| Tie the cloth at the top and tighten every 15 minutes for one hour as the [[Whey|whey]] drains.  A sterilised plastic clothes peg is useful for this.\n| Take the [[Curd|curd]] from the cloth and cut the curd into 4 strips.\n| Stack the strips on top of each other and cover.\n| After 30 minutes, put the inner [[Curd|curd]] strips on the outside and leave for another 30 minutes.\n| You then need to [[Dry-salt|dry-salt]], so weigh the [[Curd|curd]], cut it into [[Pea|pea]] sized pieces. \n| Add the [[Salt|salt]].  If you have a kilo of [[Curd|curd]], add 14g of salt, or for 500g curd add 7g.  You will need to work this out accurately depending on your exact weight!\n| Mix well.\n| Line your [[Mould|mould]] with clean [[Cheesecloth|cheesecloth]] (although personally, I did not actually line mine).\n| Press lightly for 1 hour and then increase the pressure a little for each hour afterwards.\n| Then leave under full pressure for 24 hours.\n| Remove the [[Cheese|cheese]] from the [[Mould|mould]], turn, and replace in a clean [[Cheesecloth|cheesecloth]].\n| Press under maximum pressure for a further two days.\n| Briefly place the [[Cheese|cheese]] in [[Brine|brine]] (for about and hour), then seal in water at 66 [[Degrees|degrees]] C for one minute.\n| Allow to dry, paint with [[rapeseed oil]] and wrap in a bandage until mature - about 2 months.\n| Unless you have a cave handy, the [[fridge]] is probably the best place to mature your [[homemade cheese]] although it's really going to be too cold. After discovering the top shelf of my often-opened fridge could be as much as 5\u00b0 C warmer than the bottom, I've decided to mature my cheeses there.  As all fridges differ, check various areas of your fridge with a thermometer to find the area that is around 11\u00b0C [51\u00b0 F], the ideal 'cave' temperature.\n}}\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes|Derby cheese]]\n[[Category:Cheese making|Derby cheese]]\n[[Category:British recipes|Derby cheese]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes|Derby cheese]]\n\n[[Category:Uncooked]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#curd #cheesecloth #cheese #degrees #homemadederbycheese #whey #calciumchloride #liquidstarter #mould #brine #pasteurised </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
