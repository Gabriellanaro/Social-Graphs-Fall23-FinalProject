This neat idea gets you not only the buttermilk, but alos the butter to spread on the bread once it's made.  All you need is 700 ml of double cream (heavy cream) and a hand whisk.\n\nOnce you over-beat the [[Double cream|double cream]], the [[Butter|butter]] begins to separate into [[Buttermilk|buttermilk]] and butter.\n\nThis can be done by [[Hand|hand]] if you have the time and the energy.  ''tip''; Have an electric whisk to hand for when you give up !\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 700 ml [[Double cream|double cream]]\n| &#188; to &#189; a teaspoon of fine [[Salt|salt]], optional for salted butter\n}}\n\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Pour the [[Double cream|double cream]] into a large bowl\n| Start by using the beating attachment and whisk until the [[Cream|cream]] starts to solidify - this took about 3 minutes of continual whisking.\n\n| Once the [[Butter|butter]] starts to appear, I found it easier to continue with the dough-hook attachment as butter starts to clog the whisk.\n| To prevent covering the kitchen in [[Buttermilk|buttermilk]] it's probably a good idea to decant the buttermilk you have at this stage to another container.\n| Another few minutes with the [[Dough|dough]] hook and the separation should be complete.\n| Strain off the remaining [[Buttermilk|buttermilk]], whisk in a &#188; to &#189; a teaspoon of fine [[Salt|salt]] if you want [[Salted|salted]] [[Butter|butter]].\n| On a cool day you can pat the [[Butter|butter]] into shape.  If it's very warm you can do this by [[Hand|hand]] in a bowl aof very cold water.\n| Use your [[Buttermilk|buttermilk]] to make the [[Bread|bread]] and the [[Butter|butter]] to spread on it\n}}\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Home-made butter and buttermilk recipe_ingredients.jpg|thumb|300px|right| Beginning to separate\nImage:Home-made butter and buttermilk recipe_by_hand.jpg|thumb|300px|right|700 ml of double cream and a hand whisk\n</gallery>\n===Chef's notes===\nThis is probably a long-winded method of making butter, but it's very nice butter and quite fun, if not a little messy.
