Don't overwork the pastry here of you won't get a crumbly pastry\n| Keep adding the [[milk ]]until you can form the mixture into a ball, which will hold together, but not be sticky\n| Wrap in [[cling-film]] and place in the [[Fridge|fridge]] for half-an-hour before use.\n| This can be made in a [[Food processor|food processor]], in which case process the [[Flour|flour]], [[Sugar|sugar]], [[egg]] and [[Butter|butter]] together, using the pulse setting.  Slowly add the milk and the mixture should automatically form itself into a ball when enough milk has been added.  Do not over-process though, as it will make the mixture too warm.\n}}\n===Chef's notes===\nOnce the [[Pastry|pastry]] has rested in the [[Fridge|fridge]], roll it out according to your recipe's instructions and add the other ingredients.  However, I always put it back in the fridge at this stage for a further 30 minutes, before I put it into the preheated oven.  I do this even with ready-made pastry.\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes|Pastry shortcrust]]\n[[Category:Bread and baking|Pastry shortcrust]]\n[[Category:British recipes|Pastry shortcrust]]\n[[Category:Pies tarts and flans|Pastry shortcrust]]\n[[Category:Historic recipes]]\n\n[[Category:Uncooked]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#butter #flour #icingsugar #fridge #egg #homemadesweetshortcrustpastry #breadcrumbs #lemonzest #pastry #desserts #foodprocessor </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
