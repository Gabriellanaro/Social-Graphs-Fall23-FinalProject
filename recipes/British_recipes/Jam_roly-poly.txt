Usually served with English homemade [[custard]]!\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 250 g (8 oz) [[self-raising flour]]\n| 125 g (4 oz)  [[shredded suet]] - eg: [[Suet|Atora]]\n| 8 tablespoons water\n| 4 tablespoons [[raspberry]] [[jam]]\n| 1 [[egg]], beaten\n| [[Caster sugar]] for dusting\n| [[Milk]] for brushing\n| Pinch of table [[salt]]\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Preheat the oven to 200\u00b0 C (400\u00b0 F - gas 6 - Moderately hot)\n| In a sieve, sift the [[flour]] into a bowl with the pinch of table [[salt]]\n| Add the water and [[suet]] and [[Kneading bread|knead]] to make a soft, dryish [[dough]] - not sticky\n| Tip the [[dough]] onto a floured surface and roll into a rectangle, about 20 cm x 30 cm (8\" x 12\")\n| Warm the jam for a few seconds in the microwave or over a bowl of hot water so it can be brushed easily\n| [[Brush]] the jam onto the pastry., leaving a 1 cm (1/2\") gap all around the edges\n| [[Brush]] the border with [[milk]]\n| With the short side nearest you, loosely roll up, away from you\n| Lightly pinch the edges to seal\n| Sit the roly-poly (long sealed edge) on a greased baking sheet\n| [[Brush]] with the beaten [[egg]] and sprinkle with [[caster sugar]]\n| [[Bake]] in the oven for 35 to 40 minutes. It should be golden brown when done\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\n\nSprinkle with a little [[caster sugar]] and serve hot with [[homemade custard]]\n===Shelf life===\nI have found that packet suet has a limited shelf life once opened. I thought I was unable to make decent [[dumplings]] until I threw out what turned out to be rancid suet and made them with a fresh packet!\n<span class=\"review\">\n<span class=\"reviewHeader\">\n====Best recipe review====\n</span>\n''<span class=\"reviewTitle\">Too heavy for my tum.</span>''\n\n<span style=\"line-height:180%\"><span style=\"font-size:180%;\"><span class=\"reviewScore\">4.3</span>/5 </span>\n\n<span class=\"reviewDesc\">This was fine when I was 12 but now it's just too stodgy for my liking - sorry</span> \n\n<span class=\"reviewAuthor\"> [[User:PSmith|Paul&nbsp;R&nbsp;Smith]] </span></span>\n\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Sweets and desserts]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#brush #castersugar #egg #jamrolypoly #suet #dough #custard #dumplings #raspberry #homemadecustard #kneadingbread </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
