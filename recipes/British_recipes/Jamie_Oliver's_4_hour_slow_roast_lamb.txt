So here is what I remember of the program.\n\nIt uses shoulder of [[Lamb|lamb]], which, because of the time spent cooking at a very low heat, will be tender and just fall off the bone when the dish is done.\n\nCooking does not get much simpler (and tastier) than this!\n\nWe have a large selection of '''[[slow roast recipes]]''' that are similar to this one.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 1.5 kg shoulder of [[Lamb|lamb]] on the bone\n| 1 whole [[Garlic|garlic]] bulb\n| Sea [[Salt|salt]] and freshly ground [[Black pepper|black pepper]]\n| Lots and lots of fresh of [[Rosemary|rosemary]] stems.\n| [[Olive]] [[Oil|oil]] for drizzling\n}}\n\n'''For the hot [[caper]] and [[Mint|mint]] [[Sauce|sauce]]'''\n* 1 tablespoon plain [[Flour|flour]]\n* 2 big handfuls of freshly picked [[Mint|mint]] leaves\n* 4 tablespoons [[Capers|capers]]\n* 1 pint of [[Chicken|chicken]] [[Stock|stock]]\n* 2 tablespoons [[Sherry|sherry]] [[Vinegar|vinegar]]\n\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n* Preheat the oven to its '''hottest''' setting.\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Slow roast lamb out of the oven.jpg|Just out of the oven, resting for a while...\nImage:Jamie Oliver's 4 hour slow roast lamb recipe.jpg|It's 4pm and we're ready to roast\nImage:Hot mint and caper sauce recipe.jpg|Hot mint and caper sauce\n</gallery>\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| With a sharp knife, score the skin of the joint every 2.5 cm (1\"). Cut about halfway through the [[Fat|fat]].\n| Using plenty of [[Salt|salt]] and [[Pepper|pepper]], season the [[Lamb|lamb]] on both sides, ensuring you get plenty into the slashes you have made.\n| Smash the [[Garlic|garlic]] bulb to separate all of the [[Cloves|cloves]] and place half of them, unpeeled, in the base of a suitable sized [[roasting tray]].\n| Distribute most of the [[Rosemary|rosemary]] stems evenly into the base of the tray.\n| Sit the [[Meat|meat]], skin-side upwards, into the [[roasting tray]] and place the remaining [[Garlic|garlic]] [[Cloves|cloves]] on the top of the skin, together with the remaining [[Rosemary|rosemary]] stems.\n| Drizzle 3 or 4 tablespoons of [[Olive|olive]] [[Oil|oil]] over the skin of the [[Lamb|lamb]].\n| Cover with 2 layers of [[tin-foil]] and fold the edges over the edge of the [[roasting tin]] to ensure a good seal.\n| Check that the oven has reached its highest temperature and place the joint in the oven on the top shelf and '''immediately turn the oven down to 160\u00b0 C (325\u00b0 F - gas 3)'''\n| Leave to roast slowly for 4 hours.\n| After 4 hours, remove the [[Lamb|lamb]], together with the [[Garlic|garlic]], and put the meat on a preheated plate. Cover loosely with a piece of foil and leave to rest for a while before carving and serving with the sauce. \n}}\n\n'''To make the hot mint and caper sauce'''\n# Discard most of the [[Rosemary|rosemary]] and any excess [[Oil|oil]], leaving just the lovely caramelised juices from the [[roasting]].\n# Heat the [[roasting tray]] on the hob and add a tablespoon of plain [[Flour|flour]] and stir well to soak up all of the lovely juices.\n# Roughly chop the [[Mint|mint]] leaves and the [[Capers|capers]] and add to the [[roasting tray]].\n# Squeeze a few of the roasted garlic cloves into the gravy.\n# Add the [[Chicken|chicken]] [[Stock|stock]] to the tray, stirring well to thicken, but don't cook it for ages.\n# Add a final splash of [[Sherry|sherry]] [[Vinegar|vinegar]] to the gravy, stir and serve.\n\n===Serving suggestions===\n\nServe hot with [[squash mash]] and [[Parmesan turnip tops]].\n\n===Chef's note===\nIf you are using a smaller joint then you can reduce the cooking time; a small (800g) joint would only need half the cooking time.  However, it wont hurt to cook it longer as it will just do a better job of breaking down the collagen and sinews.  It's also worth noting that Lamb is safe to eat rare.\n\nDon't be put off a recipe that calls for a leg of lamb because of the high cost.  This recipe can be adjusted for [[Frozen lamb - what great value!|half a leg of lamb and you buy that (frozen)]] for just \u00a36.00! (March 2013).\n\n==See also==\n* '''[[Meat cooking time calculator Metric|A comprehensive guide to roast meat cooking times]]''' - give the time you want to carve your roast and we'll give you a timed step by step roasting guide\n* [[Slow roast recipes]]\n* [[Roast potatoes]]\n* [[Roast vegetables]]\n* [[Gravy recipes]]\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes|Lamb]]\n[[Category:Lamb recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses|Lamb]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes|Lamb]]\n[[Category:Stews and casseroles|Lamb]]\n[[Category:British recipes|Lamb]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#lamb #jamieolivers4hourslowroastlamb #roastingtray #garlic #rosemary #mint #chicken #vinegar #sherry #stock #slowroastrecipes </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
