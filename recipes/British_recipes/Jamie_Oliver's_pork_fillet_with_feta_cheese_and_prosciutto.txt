The [[Feta cheese|feta cheese]] adds a really interesting flavour, sour, almost [[Lemon|lemon]]-like.  I only used 150g of [[Pork fillet|pork fillet]] as that was what was in the [[Freezer|freezer]].  As it was it was plenty for 2 people.\n\nNext time I would try this with a nice [[Ham|ham]] or very thinly sliced [[Bacon|bacon]]. [[Prosciutto]] is probably a bit fiddly for this recipe.  jamie made an impression with his thumb to put the cheese in; I found using cocktail sticks meant that you could leave the cheese as photographed here.\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| 2 tablespoons of [[Olive oil|olive oil]]\n| Pinch of [[Freshly ground black pepper|freshly ground black pepper]]\n| 150 g [[Pork fillet|pork fillet]] (half of 1 fillet, sliced lengthwise)\n| 100g [[Feta cheese|feta cheese]] (half a pack)\n| 1 pack of [[Prosciutto|prosciutto]] (or thinly sliced streaky [[Bacon|bacon]], see above)\n| 2 medium [[Onions|onions]], peeled and chopped\n| A good pinch of [[Dried oregano|dried oregano]]\n}}\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:150g pork fillet perfectly cooked.jpg|Cooked to perfection and nothing fell out!\nImage:150g pork fillet first fry.jpg|Frying begins\nImage:150g pork fillet oregano added.jpg|Covered with dried oregano and black pepper\nImage:150g pork fillet bashed flat.jpg|Bashed flat under a baking mat\nImage:150g pork fillet.jpg|150g pork fillet, cut into squares\n</gallery>\n\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| Cut the [[Pork fillet|pork fillet]] into squares\n| Spread the [[Pork fillet|pork fillet]] pieces evenly on a chopping board and cover with a [[Silicone baking mat|silicone baking mat]] (or [[Clingfilm|clingfilm]]) and bash flat with a [[Rolling pin|rolling pin]]\n| Measure out your [[Feta cheese|feta cheese]] and put the pack back in the [[Fridge|fridge]] - it's very easy to get the [[Cheese|cheese]] cross-contaminated in preparing a recipe like this.\n| Meanwhile gently [[Fry|fry]] the [[Onions|onions]] in a little [[Olive oil|olive oil]].\n| Roughly distribute the [[Cheese|cheese]] on the flattened [[Pork|pork]] squares - you don't have to be that neat, the [[Cocktail sticks|cocktail sticks]] will save the day!\n| Shake [[Dried oregano|dried oregano]] and [[Black pepper|black pepper]] over the [[Cheese|cheese]].\n| Roll up each square in a sheet of [[Prosciutto|prosciutto]] (or [[Bacon|bacon]]) and pin with a [[Cocktail stick|cocktail stick]].\n| Leaving the [[Onions|onions]] in th epan, place each pice of [[Pork|pork]] in the pan making sure it contacts the base of the pan.\n| [[Pan-fry]] for about 5 minutes.\n| Tun over and [[Fry|fry]] the other side for a further 5 minutes.\n| Pick the thickest piece of [[Pork|pork]] to make sure it's properly cooked.\n| Serve!\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe with [[Mashed potatoes|mashed potatoes]], [[Vegetables|vegetables]] and [[Onion gravy|onion gravy]].\n===Recipe source===\n\n* Jamie Oliver TV program\n===Variations===\nUse thinly sliced streaky [[Bacon|bacon]] instead of [[Prosciutto|prosciutto]]\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Cheese recipes]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:Pork recipes]]\n[[Category:Favourite recipes]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n[[Category:Pan fried]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#bacon #prosciutto #porkfillet #cheese #pork #fetacheese #onions #jamieoliversporkfilletwithfetacheeseandprosciutto #driedoregano #fry #oliveoil </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
