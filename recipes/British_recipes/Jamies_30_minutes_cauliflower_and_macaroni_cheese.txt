We regularly have variations of a similar recipe but using [[Broccoli|broccoli]] instead of [[cauliflower]]. I thought it would be fun to try it 'Jamies way'.  I really liked the idea of the topping he used with the slices of [[Pancetta|pancetta]] and [[Breadcrumbs|breadcrumbs]]. \n\nI won't be attempting to do the whole meal in 30 minutes - just preheating the [[Oven|oven]] breaks that one!\n\nYou will need a [[Food processor|food processor]] with a [[Grating|grating]] attachment and a metal blade for this recipe.\n\nI must say, the great tip taken from this recipe was to cook the [[cauliflower]] in quarters (leaves 'n all) with the [[pasta]] and just mash it when you assemble the dish. Genius, thanks Jamie!\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| 1 medium [[Cauliflower|cauliflower]]\n| 500g [[Dried pasta|dried pasta]] (small [[Macaroni|macaroni]] is good for this)\n| 250 g freshly [[Grated|grated]] mature [[Cheddar|cheddar]] or similar strong 'melting [[Cheese|cheese]]'\n| 2 [[Cloves of Garlic, peeled and crushed|cloves of garlic, peeled and crushed]]\n| 250 g [[Creme fraiche|creme fraiche]]\n| [[Sea Salt|sea salt]] and [[Freshly ground black pepper|freshly ground black pepper]]\n}}\n'''[[Bacon|bacon]] [[Crumble topping|crumble topping]]'''\n{{RecipeIngredientsNB\n| 8 slices of [[Pancetta|pancetta]] or similar thin cut, high quality [[Cured|cured]] [[Ham|ham]]\n| 3 [[Brown|brown]] [[Bread rolls|bread rolls]] or 6 slices of good [[Brown bread|brown bread]]\n| 2 [[Cloves of Garlic, peeled and crushed|cloves of garlic, peeled and crushed]]\n| Leaves picked and chopped from a bunch of [[Fresh herbs|fresh herbs]] of your choice\n| [[Olive oil]]\n| [[Sea Salt|sea salt]] and [[Freshly ground black pepper|freshly ground black pepper]]\n\n}}\n\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n\n* Preheat the [[Oven|oven]] to 220\u00b0 C (425\u00b0 F - gas 7), [fan [[Oven|oven]] 200\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]\n* Fill and [[Boil|boil]] a [[Kettle|kettle]] of water\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| Using no [[Oil|oil]], lay the [[Pancetta|pancetta]] or [[Bacon|bacon]] out in the base of an [[Oven|oven]]-proof [[Baking tray|baking tray]]\n| Place in the middle of the preheated [[Oven|oven]] for about 6 minutes or until the [[Pancetta|pancetta]] is nice and crispy.\n| Quarter the [[Cauliflower|cauliflower]] together with the surrounding leaves and pop in a large pan.\n| Add the [[Pasta|pasta]] to the same pan and fill with [[Boiling|boiling]] water, ensuring  the [[Cauliflower|cauliflower]] is covered.  Stir the pan to ensure the [[Macaroni|macaroni]] does not start to stick. ''It's heartening to see that even Jamie manages to get [[Macaroni|macaroni]] stuck to the base of the pan''! \n| Add 1.5 teaspoons of [[Sea Salt|sea salt]], cover with a lid and bring to the [[Boil|boil]].\n| If you saw the TV program, Jamie lets it boil over (you know it's boiling then!) and then turns it down to a simmer and rests a wooden spoon under the lid to lift it up and prevent it boiling over again.\n| Put a metal blade in the [[Food processor|food processor]] and add the crispy [[Pancetta|pancetta]] and any of the [[Oil|oil]] left after the cooking.\n| Tear the rolls into a few pieces and add those to the [[Pancetta|pancetta]].\n| Pick the leaves from your chosen [[Herbs|herbs]] and add those.\n| Season with [[Salt|salt]] and [[Pepper|pepper]], add 2 [[Cloves|cloves]] of [[Crushed garlic|crushed garlic]] and 2 tablespoons of [[Olive oil|olive oil]].\n| Blitzt into [[Breadcrumbs|breadcrumbs]].\n| Once the [[Pasta|pasta]] and [[Cauliflower|cauliflower]] is cooked to your liking, drain, reserving 400 ml of the water it was cooked in.\n| Put the tray that the bacon was cooked in n the hob and heat it up.\n| Using the fat remaining from the bacon, or a little extra [[olive oil]] if needed, saut\u00e9 the crushed [[garlic]] with a little black pepper until it is slightly coloured. \n| Tip the [[Cauliflower|cauliflower]] and [[Pasta|pasta]] into the [[Baking tray|baking tray]] the [[Pancetta|pancetta]] was cooked in and roughly [[Mash|mash]] with a [[Potato masher|potato masher]].\n| Add the [[Grated|grated]] [[Cheddar|cheddar]] and mix with 420 ml of the cooking liquid.\n| Stir in the [[Creme fraiche|creme fraiche]] and mix everything really well to make a gorgeous [[Sauce|sauce]].\n| Tip the [[Breadcrumb|breadcrumb]] mixture over the top of the [[Pasta|pasta]] and top with a sprinkling of [[Parmesan cheese|parmesan cheese]].\n| Place in the top of the [[Oven|oven]], lay a sheet of [[tin-foil]] over the top to prevent it burning and [[Bake|bake]] for about 15 minutes or until nice and golden.\n}}\n<gallery widths=270px heights=270px perrow=5>\nImage:Cauliflower and macaroni cheese_ingredients.jpg|The basic ingredients\nImage:Roughly trim the cauliflower.jpg|Roughly trim the cauliflower\nImage:Lay the pancetta in an oven tray.jpg|Lay the pancetta in an oven tray\nImage:Hold the lid open.jpg|Hold the lid open with a wooden spoon\nImage:Blitzing bacon.jpg|Blitz the bacon with the breadcrumbs\nImage:Mashing genius.jpg|Mashing genius!\nImage:Not wet dont worry.jpg|Don't worry about too much water - even with this much liquid, this turned out too dry\nImage:Bacon breadcrumbs.jpg|Bacon, herb and breadcrumb topping\nImage:Cauliflower and macaroni cheese recipe.jpg|Cauliflower mac'n'cheese in 30 minutes (almost)\n</gallery>\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe with a [[Green salad|green salad]].\n===Variations===\nUse [[Bacon|bacon]] instead of [[Pancetta|pancetta]], though you will probably need to increase the cooking time because it's quite a bit thicker than [[Pancetta|pancetta]] and we want it to be crispy for this dish.\n===Chef's notes===\nI've increased the original 400 ml of liquid to 420 ml as I found it a little on the dry side.  I would also lay a sheet of tin-foil over the  breadcrumbs on the final bake as ours burnt a little.\n\nFollow the [[RSPCA Think Pig Checklist]] to make sure that your [[Pork|pork]] has come from pigs that have been reared to higher welfare standards.\n\n* http://bit.ly/rspcathinkpig\n\n==See also==\n\n* [http://www.channel4.com/programmes/jamies-30-minute-meals/4od#3213866 A video of Jamie Oliver cooking this recipe] (registration required)\n* [http://www.strandsofmylife.com/jamie-olivers-30-minute-cauliflower-macaroni-cheese/ A similar recipe] on a nice New Zealand cookery blog I've discovered.\n\n{{Template:YoutubePastaDough}}\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:North American recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Cheese recipes]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:Pasta recipes]]\n[[Category:Pork recipes]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n[[Category:Boiled or simmered]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#pancetta #cauliflower #pasta #oliveoil #bacon #macaroni #foodprocessor #grated #cremefraiche #breadcrumbs #jamies30minutescauliflowerandmacaronicheese </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
