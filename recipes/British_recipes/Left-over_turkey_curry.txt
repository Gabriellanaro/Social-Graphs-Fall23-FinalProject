All supermarkets sell many brands of curry paste and they are all good.  Look out for Thai green curry paste or Thai red curry paste.  My favourite is Cok Brand [[Curry]] Paste but I've only seen it in [[Oriental stores]].\n[[Image:Left-over turkey curry ingredients.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Left-over [[Turkey|turkey]] [[Curry|curry]] - the ingredients]]\n\nThe resulting [[Curry|curry]] is just warmly spicy, but not hot.  Use this as the base curry and as chopped fresh [[Green chillies|green chillies]] or [[Chilli sauce|chilli sauce]] to add the actual heat.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 1.5 tablespoons [[Oil|oil]] or [[Butter|butter]] for [[Frying|frying]]. Margerine or butter spreads don't really work very well.\n| 1 large [[Onion|onion]], peeled and chopped\n| 1 tablespoon [[Curry paste|curry paste]]\n| 400 ml [[Coconut milk|coconut milk]]\n| Enough leftover cooked [[Turkey|turkey]] for two people\n| 1 handful of [[Dried fruit|dried fruit]] such as [[Raisins|raisins]], [[Sultanas|sultanas]], [[Apricots|apricots]] etc. (optional)\n| Chopped fresh [[Green chillies|green chillies]] or [[Chilli sauce|chilli sauce]] (optional)\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Heat the [[Oil|oil]] in a [[Frying pan|frying pan]], saucepan or [[Wok|wok]]. Not too hot, don't let it start to smoke.\n| [[Fry]] the chopped [[Onions|onions]] for 5 or 6 minutes util they turn golden [[Brown|brown]].\n| Stir in the [[Curry paste|curry paste]] so it coats the [[Onions|onions]].\n| Turn down the heat and pour in the [[Coconut milk|coconut milk]] and stir well.\n| Add the cooked [[Turkey|turkey]] and the [[Dried fruit|dried fruit]] (optional) and gently [[Simmer|simmer]] for about 10 minutes while the [[Boiled rice|boiled rice]] is cooked.\n| You can serve the [[Curry|curry]] immediately or leave it for an hour or so and just reheat when you want to serve it.\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe with [[Boiled rice|boiled rice]] and chopped fresh [[Chillies|chillies]] or [[Chilli sauce|chilli sauce]].\n===Variations===\nIf everyone wants a hot [[Curry|curry]], stir in [[Chilli powder|chilli powder]] to taste (about 1 to 2 teaspoons) with the [[Curry paste|curry paste]].\n\nIf you need to bulk this out to stretch to four people, add a can of [[kidney beans]] or similar.  If you need a little more liquid, add a slug of [[beer]] or [[lager]].\n===Chef's notes===\nMany curry pastes are water-based so do not keep well in the fridge, however, they freeze very well and often the contents can be spooned out while the paste is still 'frozen'.\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Spicy recipes]]\n[[Category:Chilli pepper recipes]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:Student recipes]]\n[[Category:Boiled or simmered]]\n[[Category:Thai recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#curry #leftoverturkeycurry #currypaste #turkey #chillisauce #boiledrice #driedfruit #greenchillies #onions #coconutmilk #chillipowder </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
