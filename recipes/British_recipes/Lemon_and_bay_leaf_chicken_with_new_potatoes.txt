Cut large potatoes into   fairly small even-sized pieces so they cook at the same rate.\n\nIf you have free access to fresh bay leaves, use them!  Scatter a handful into the vegetable mix at the start.  The same for any left over lemon pieces, squeeze the lemon juice over the vegetables and scatter the pieces over the vegetables.  They can be discarded at before serving but they add a little more aroma and flavour to the dish.\n\nNot being a white-[[Wine|wine]] drinker, but having [[Sherry|sherry]] for cooking, if [[White wine|white wine]] is called for I often mix [[Dry sherry|dry sherry]] with a little water instead.\n==See also==\n* {{See also - Jointing a chicken}}\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:Potato recipes]]\n[[Category:Poultry recipes]]\n[[Category:Cooking with wine]]\n[[Category:Stewed, braised or pot roasted]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#newpotatoes #chicken #lemonandbayleafchickenwithnewpotatoes #garlic #lemon #greensalad #oliveoil #whitewine #bellpeppers #redonion #bayleaf </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
