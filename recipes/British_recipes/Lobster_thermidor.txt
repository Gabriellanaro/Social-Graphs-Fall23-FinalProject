Large supermarkets sell them now, as do good fishmongers.\n\nI got lucky when I went to buy the (cooked) lobster from Tesco's as they were reduced, so I got the lobster for \u00a37.49, which meant lobster thermidor for two cost less than a tenner! (''August 2008'')\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 1 whole [[Lobster]], cooked\n| 25 g ( 1 oz) [[butter]]\n| 1 [[shallot]] or small [[onion]], finely chopped\n| 284ml (1/2 pint) very good quality [[Fish stock|fish stock]] - &#189; a tin of good [[lobster bisque soup]] is an excellent substitute, if not better\n| 50 ml (2 fl oz) [[white wine]]\n| 100 ml (4 fl oz) [[double cream]]\n| 2 tablespoons fresh [[parsley]], chopped\n| &#189; teaspoon [[English mustard]] powder\n| Juice from half a [[lemon]]\n| Pinch of chopped [[lemon]] [[zest]]\n| Splash of [[brandy]]\n| [[Sea salt]] and [[freshly ground black pepper]]\n| 25 g (1 oz) [[Parmesan cheese]], freshly [[grated]]\n| [[Lemon]] quarters to garnish\n}}\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:How to make Lobster thermidor.jpg|Stock - reduced\nImage:Cooking Lobster thermidor.jpg|Before the sauce\nImage:How to prepare Lobster thermidor.jpg|\u00a37.50 !\n</gallery>\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Twist off the claws and smash open with a hammer to remove the [[meat]]. Reserve.\n| Lay the lobster on its back and split in half from head to toe.\n| Scoop out the [[meat]] from the head and body and reserve\n| Chop the [[meat]] into small pieces, mix up a bit and arrange back in the shell\n| Heat the [[butter]] in a pan, [[sweat]] the chopped [[shallot]] until translucent - about 5 minutes on a low heat\n| Add the [[stock]], [[wine]], [[brandy]] and bring to the [[boil]]. Reduce until it is half of its original volume, less if using soup. Add the [[mustard]], [[lemon juice]], [[zest]] and [[double cream]] \n| Season with [[salt]] and [[pepper]] and mix in half of the chopped [[parsley]]\n| Preheat the grill\n| Spoon the [[sauce]] over the [[lobster]] meat\n| Sprinkle the [[grated]] [[Parmesan cheese]] over the  top and add a twist of [[pepper]]\n| Heat under the grill for about 4 minutes - just enough make the [[cheese]] bubble\n| Sprinkle the remaining parsley over the top \n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\n\nServe immediately with lemon quarters as a garnish\n\nI served this with [[lemon rice]] which worked really well as an accompaniment.\n\nEqually good accompaniments would be [[new potatoes]] and a [[green salad]], or a [[tomato and onion salad]] to cut through the richness of the sauce, and then some [[Basic French loaf|crusty French bread]] to soak up all the juices.\n\n==See also==\n{{Template:Lobster recipes}}\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Fish recipes]]\n[[Category:Shellfish recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Cooking with wine]]\n[[Category:Boiled or simmered]]\n[[Category:Grilled, griddled or barbecued]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\nHector Acosta: All I just want to add is this: This is MY FAVOURITE DISH EVER!!!\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#lobsterthermidor #lemon #shallot #zest #grated #butter #parsley #lobster #doublecream #parmesancheese #brandy </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
