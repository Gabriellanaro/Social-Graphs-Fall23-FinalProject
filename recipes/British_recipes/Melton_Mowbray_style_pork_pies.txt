Don't over do it or you will end up with meat paste\n}}\n'''Hot water crust pastry''' \n{{RecipeMethod\n| Sift the [[salt]] and [[flour]] into a bowl\n| Mix the water and [[milk]] into a small pan gently heat\n| Cut the [[lard]] into small pieces and drop into the [[milk]]/water mix\n| Once the [[lard]] has completely melted, raise the heat and bring to the [[boil]] and then immediately remove from the heat\n| Pour into the [[flour]] and using a wooden spoon, mix well\n| Dust a chopping board with a little extra [[flour]] and [[Kneading bread|knead]] the [[dough]] for a minute or two\n| Use 2/3rds of the [[dough]] for the pies and 1/3 for the lids\n| Divide 2/3rd into 6 and roll into balls, using your hands, mould each ball into a pie shape\n| Divide the filling into six portions and fill the pies\n| Using a pastry [[brush]], paint a little of the [[egg yolk]] around the rim of each pie\n| Divide the remaining 1/3rd into six pieces, roll into balls and then roll each ball flat to make the pie lids\n| Crimp the lids to the pies with the tines of a fork and glaze the pies with any remaining [[egg yolk]]\n| Make a little [[steam]] slash in the top of each pie and [[bake]] on a tray for about 50 to 55 minutes\n| Allow to cool on a wire rack\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\n\nServe warm or cold\n\n===Chef's notes===\n\nHaving made these, I would suggest that this quantity is better suited to 4 slightly larger pies.  Although unconventional, to prevent them collapsing, I would bake them in [[muffin trays]].\n\n===Authenticity===\n\nPlease note: True Melton Mowbray Pork Pies do not and never have contained cured pork (''bacon'').\n\n{{Template:ThinkPig}}\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Historic recipes]]\n[[Category:Pork recipes]]\n[[Category:Pies tarts and flans]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#meltonmowbraystyleporkpies #flour #eggyolk #lard #pork #dough #anchovyessence #plainflour #muffintrays #groundallspice #boil </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
