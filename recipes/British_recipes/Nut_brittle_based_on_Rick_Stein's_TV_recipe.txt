I have lots of lovely [[Nuts|nuts]] from RealFoodSource bought from [[Amazon]] recently so I thought I would make something similar. I'm only interested in the [[Nut|nut]] brittle and I'm going to use [[Brazil nuts]], [[Cashew nuts]] and [[Almonds|almonds]].  I've blitzed &#190; of the nuts and left the remaining nuts whole.\n\nGo easy when consuming this as it contains a massive amount of [[Sugar|sugar]]!\n\nSee '''Chef's notes''' below for ''improvements'' I've made to Rick's recipe.\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| 2 tablespoons of [[Butter|butter]]\n| &#189; a [[Cup|cup]] of [[Granulated sugar|granulated sugar]]\n| &#189; a [[Cup|cup]] of [[Muscovado sugar|muscovado sugar]]\n| 100 ml water\n| 1 teaspoon [[Sea Salt|sea salt]]\n| 1 [[Cup|cup]] of mixed [[Nuts|nuts]] of your choice - some broken, some whole.\n}}\n\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| Line a [[Baking tray|baking tray]] with [[Greaseproof paper|greaseproof paper]] - check that it will fit in the [[Fridge|fridge]]! \n| Add the [[Butter|butter]], [[Sugar|sugar]] and water to a heavy based pan and heat over a medium flame\n| Carefully stir until everything has combined\n| [[Boil]] for about 10 minutes until it reaches 'hard-crack' stage\n| Threads should be formed as you pull a spoon away and the threads should break easily when cooled\n| If you have a [[Jam|jam]] [[Thermometer|thermometer]] your looking for about 146\u00b0-155 \u00b0 C (295\u00b0-310\u00b0 F).\n| Do not let the [[Sugar|sugar]] burn or it will be brittle\n| Stir in the [[Nuts|nuts]], mix well and quickly pour the mixture onto the [[Greaseproof paper|greaseproof paper]] and spread out with a [[Spatula|spatula]].\n| [[Refrigerate]] for around 30 minutes, then break up the brittle into bite-sized pieces.\n}}\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nNut brittle based on Rick Stein's TV recipe.jpg|The original, rather soft version\n</gallery>\n===Chef's notes===\nAfter finding that this was far too sweet for me, and rather too soft, I made some improvements:\n* I tipped everything into a big [[saucepan]].\n* Added a further 2 cups of mixed nuts.\n* Heated for 10 minutes, stirring all the time.\n* Even after this, the nuts actually tasted soft, not what I wanted.\n* I put the oven on a very low grill [120\u00b0] and tipped the sticky nut mixture onto an unlined oven tray.\n* Grill/baked the nut mixture for about 15 minutes.\n* Allow to cool completely\n* Smash the toffee mixture into smaller pieces and store in a [[Lock and Lock box]]\n* '''They are now perfect''' (for my taste)\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Snacks and light bites]]\n[[Category:Sweets and desserts]]\n[[Category:Vegan recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes]]\n[[Category:Student recipes]]\n[[Category:Boiled or simmered]]\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:12032020'>#nuts #cup #greaseproofpaper #butter #almonds #nutbrittlebasedonricksteinstvrecipe #nut #snacksandlightbites #bakingtray #sweetsanddesserts #refrigerate</code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
