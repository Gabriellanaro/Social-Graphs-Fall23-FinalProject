Remember that if your [[Ice cream maker|ice cream maker]] doesn't have a built in [[Freezer|freezer]], you will need to [[Freeze|freeze]] your bowl for at least 12 hours before use.\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| 3 [[Litres|litres]] full [[Fat|fat]] [[Milk|milk]]\n| 2 teaspoons finely [[Grated|grated]] [[Orange|orange]] rind\n| 180g condensed milk ([[Thermomix]] owners can [[Condensed milk 1 (TM)|make their own]])\n| 15g liquid [[Glucose|glucose]]\n| [[Orange]] extract, to taste (I use Sainsbury's Taste the Difference Valencian Orange Extract)\n}}\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n\n* Place a bowl of cold water into the [[Freezer|freezer]] for about an hour - the bowl should be large enough to hold the bowl in which you will be mixing the ingredients\n\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| Bring the [[Milk|milk]] to the [[Boil|boil]] with the [[Orange|orange]] rind in a [[Saucepan|saucepan]] and keep on the heat until you are left with about 1.1 [[Litres|litres]].\n| Meanwhile, mix the [[Condensed milk|condensed milk]] and the [[Glucose|glucose]] in a bowl.\n| Once the [[Milk|milk]] has reduced, stir it into the bowl.\n| Cool the mixture as quickly as possible, by putting the bowl inside the one that you have placed in the [[Freezer|freezer]].\n| Mix in the [[Orange|orange]] extract, a little at a time until it is to your taste.  However, remember that once [[Frozen|frozen]], the orange taste will be less pronounced.\n| Once the mixture is cooled, put it in the [[Fridge|fridge]] to chill further.  This is optional, but preferable if your [[Ice cream maker|ice cream maker]] is one without a built [[Freezer|freezer]], ie where you need to [[Freeze|freeze]] the bowl before use.\n| Pour the mixture into your [[Ice cream maker|ice cream maker]] and churn according to the manufacturer's instructions - it should still be slightly soft.\n| Transfer to a container and [[Freeze|freeze]] until required.\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nRemove from the [[Freezer|freezer]] a short while before serving, so that it is able to be scopped out.  Will go nicely with other [[Citrus|citrus]] [[Desserts|desserts]] or with [[Chocolate|chocolate]] and [[Strawberries|strawberries]]\n===Recipe source===\n\n* Adapted from a recipe for [[Milk]] [[Ice cream|ice cream]] in '''Gordon Ramsay *** Chef''' ISBN 1849491909\n===Variations===\nPlay about with different flavourings using various extracts and [[Fruits|fruits]]\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Sweets and desserts]]\n[[Category:Fruit recipes]]\n[[Category:Ice-cream recipes]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n[[Category:Frozen]]\n[[Category:Boiled or simmered]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#freezer #orange #freeze #icecreammaker #icecream #glucose #litres #orangemilkicecream #fat #grated #frozen </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
