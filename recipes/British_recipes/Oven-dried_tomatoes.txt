This year, our Sungold tomatoes were not the same as they usually are, they had tough, flavourless skins and were pretty nasty, truth be told.  I tried this experiment on the remaining harvest and from a preliminary taste while they are still cooking, I wish I had more of them!\n\nThis makes a brilliant [[pizza]] topping.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 30 [[Tomatoes|tomatoes]], washed and halved (top to bottom). Cut larger ones into smaller pieces so they are all a similar size.\n| 5 [[Cloves|cloves]] of [[Garlic]], peeled and crushed\n| 2 teaspoons [[Fennel seeds|fennel seeds]], crushed in a [[Pestle and mortar|pestle and mortar]]\n| 1 tablespoon [[Demerara sugar|demerara sugar]]\n| 2 teaspoons [[Sea Salt|sea salt]]\n| [[Freshly ground black pepper]]\n| Plenty of [[Olive oil|olive oil]]\n\n}}\n\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n* Preheat the [[Oven|oven]] to 100\u00b0 C (225\u00b0 F - gas &frac14;)\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Sun-dried tomatoes at home 2.jpg|Oven-dried tomatoes -  ready for the oven\nImage:Sun-dried tomatoes at home 3.jpg|Sungold tomatoes - the colourful ingredients\nImage:Sun-dried peppers and tomatoes.jpg|A version with hot and sweet peppers and tomatoes\n</gallery>\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Lightly [[Oil|oil]] an [[Oven|oven]] tray\n| Distribute the halved [[Tomatoes|tomatoes]], skin-side down\n| Put the [[Garlic|garlic]], 3 tablespoons [[Olive oil|olive oil]], [[Sugar|sugar]], [[Fennel|fennel]] and half of the [[Salt|salt]] in a bowl and ensure that is well mixed.\n| Spoon the mixture over the [[Tomatoes|tomatoes]]\n| Season with [[Pepper|pepper]] and the remaining [[Salt|salt]] and drizzle well with [[Olive oil|olive oil]]\n| [[Roast]] for 6 hours or until there is just a tiny amount of liquid left. Keep your eye on them because once all of the liquid evaporates,, they burn really quickly. Once properly roasted they will be like little [[Toffee|toffee]] taste bombs.  If you don't eat them all immediately, store them in a [[Lock and lock|lock and lock]] box in the [[Fridge|fridge]]\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nEat like [[Sweets|sweets]] or scatter over a [[Salad|salad]]\n===Chef's notes===\nI used [[Basil|basil]] flavoured [[Olive oil]], just because I had some spare, use any flavoured [[Oils|oils]] and experiment with different [[Herbs|herbs]] and [[Spices|spices]].\n===Variations===\nI recently tried a variation using home grown [[sweet peppers]], home grown [[chili peppers]] and [[tomatoes]].  I roasted them and left them a little wetter than I normally would then blitzed them in a [[food processor]] with a metal blade.  The resulting [[pur\u00e9e]] is now in the fridge, ready for the next batch of [[pizza making]]!\n\n==See also==\n* [[Sun-dried tomato recipe]]\n* [http://yardday.com/gardening/eating-growing-tomatoes-benefits The benefits of growing and eating tomatoes - ''Yardday.com'']\n\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Accompaniments]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Pickles and preserves]]\n[[Category:Salad recipes]]\n[[Category:Snacks and light bites]]\n[[Category:Starters]]\n[[Category:Vegetable recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegan recipes]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#tomatoes #ovendriedtomatoes #oliveoil #garlic #pestleandmortar #sweets #salad #oils #spices #fennelseeds #sweetpeppers </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
