As served on Shrove Tuesday or Pancake day in the UK and Australia.  Better known in the USA as Mardi Gras or Fat Tuesday. Historically, pancakes were made on Shrove Tuesday so that the last of the fatty and rich foods could be used up before Lent.  This recipe makes 8 pancakes.\n\n===Swedish pancakes===\n\nThe recipe for traditional Swedish pancakes is the same as below, except that they might be served with a local preserve such as [[lingonberry]] jam.  They are traditionally follow [[\u00c4rtsoppa (Swedish pea soup)]] on a Thursday if what I read is to be believed.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 200 ml (7fl oz) [[milk]] mixed with 75 ml (3fl oz) cold water\n| 2 [[free range eggs]]\n| 110 g (4 oz) [[plain flour]], sifted\n| 50 g (2 oz) [[butter]]\n| pinch of table [[salt]]\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Sift the [[salt]] and [[flour]] into a large mixing bowl. Hold the sieve high so the [[flour]] gets combined with lots of air\n| Make a well in the centre of the [[flour]] and break the [[eggs]] into it.\n| With a spatula mix the [[eggs]] and [[flour]] together\n| Ideally with an electric hand mixer, gradually add the milk and water mix whilst whisking. Your goal is a smooth [[batter]] with no lumps or stray bits of [[flour]]\n| There is no need to leave the mixture to stand, make the pancakes straight away\n| Heat the [[butter]] in a heavy [[frying]] pan, swill it around so the pan is well oiled but not [[dripping]] in [[fat]].  Pour the remaining [[butter]] into a plate to use for the remaining pancakes\n| Use 2 tablespoons of [[batter]] mixture per pancake, dolloped in the middle of the pan and instantly swirl the pan around to distribute the [[batter]] around the whole of the pan\n| Cook for about 30 seconds on the first side and about 15 seconds on the other side\n| Dab a little more [[butter]] on the [[frying]] pan before every fresh pancake\n| Stack them up on a plate, separated with sheets of grease proof paper and keep them warm in a very low oven\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\n* Serve with a squeeze of [[lemon juice]] and sprinkled with [[caster sugar]]\n* Try a little pineapple or strawberry jam or a little bit of [[honey]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Breton buckwheat pancake recipe]]\n* [[Cr\u00eape recipe]]\n* [[Potato pancakes]]\n* [[Crispy duck pancake recipe]]\n* [[Crispy potato pancakes]]\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Egg recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Starters]]\n[[Category:Sweets and desserts]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Pan fried]]\n[[Category:Swedish recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#pancakes #flour #butter #batter #frying #eggs #castersugar #freerangeeggs #dripping #fat #lemonjuice </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
