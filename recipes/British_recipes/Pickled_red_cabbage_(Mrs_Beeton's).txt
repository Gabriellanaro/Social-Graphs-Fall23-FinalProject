This copy was a present for my partner's mother,  dated 1954\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 650g red cabbage (1 large red cabbage)\n| [[Salt]]\n| Water\n| 2 [[Pints|pints]] of [[Vinegar|vinegar]] 1.13 [[Litres|litres]]) - to each 2 quart (2 pints) add 1 tablespoon [[Ginger|ginger]], well bruised\n| 1oz (25 g) whole [[Black peppercorns|black peppercorns]]\n| A little cayene, if liked\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Take off the outside decayed leaves of a nice [[Red cabbage|red cabbage]], cut it into quarters, remove the stalks, and cut it across in very thin slices.\n| Lay these on a dish, and cover them plentifully with [[Salt|salt]], then cover with another dish.\n| Leave for 24 hours; turn into a [[Colander|colander]] to drain, and if necessary, wipe lightly with a clean, soft cloth. Put them in a jar; [[Boil|boil]] up the [[Vinegar|vinegar]] with the [[Spices|spices]], and when cold, pour it over the [[Cabbage|cabbage]]. | It will be fit for use in a week or two, but if kept for a very long time, the cabbage is liable to get soft and discoloured. To be really nice and crisp, and of a good red colour, it should be eaten almost immediately after it is made. A little bruised cochineal [[Boiled|boiled]] with the vinegar adds greatly to the appearance of this [[Pickle|pickle]]. Tie down with bladder, and keep in a dry place.\n}}\n\nSeasonable in July and August, but the pickle will be much more crisp if the frost has just touched the leaves.\n==See also==\n* [[Spicy pickled cabbage]] (my ''modern-day'' version of Mrs B's recipe)\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Accompaniments]]\n[[Category:Historic recipes]]\n[[Category:Pickles and preserves]]\n[[Category:Vegetable recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegan recipes]]\n[[Category:Pickled]]\n[[Category:Uncooked]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#vinegar #colander #ginger #spices #pints #spicypickledcabbage #pickle #boil #blackpeppercorns #cabbage #redcabbage </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
