Blending other [[Vinegars|vinegars]] and [[Spices|spices]] enhances the flavour of the finished [[Vinegar|vinegar]] and the addition of [[Sugar|sugar]] removes the harshness.\n\n[[Jaggery]] or other 'dark' [[Sugars|sugars]] such as [[Demerara|demerara]] and [[Muscovado|muscovado]] also adds a more interesting flavour than pure [[White sugar|white sugar]].  [[Honey]] would also be a good addition if you have a plentiful source available.\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| 300 ml [[Malt vinegar|malt vinegar]]\n| 30 ml [[Balsamic vinegar|balsamic vinegar]]\n| 20 ml Shaoxing cooking [[Wine|wine]] - basically an exotic [[Vinegar|vinegar]]\n| 2 tablespoons [[Jaggery|jaggery]] - a small ''block''\n| 1 teaspoon [[Juniper berries|juniper berries]]\n| 6 [[Clove buds|clove buds]]\n| 1 tablespoon mixed green and black [[Cardomom pods|cardomom pods]]\n| 1 teaspoon [[Szechuan peppercorns]]\n| 1 teaspoon [[Black peppercorns|black peppercorns]]\n| 3 [[Dried|dried]] [[Red chillies|red chillies]]\n}}\n\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| Add all of the ingredients to a suitable pan.\n| Bring to the [[Boil|boil]].\n| [[Simmer]] for 5 minutes.\n| Leave to cool completely.\n| Filter through a [[Paper towel|paper towel]] over a [[Sieve|sieve]], if you have added any ingredients that might cloud the [[Vinegar|vinegar]].\n| Use as required in you recipe, or just as a [[Condiment|condiment]].\n}}\n===Servings===\n350 ml of pickling vinegar\n===Variations===\nThis mixture suits my taste and also matches what I have available in my kitchen.  Experiment with a variety of [[Vinegars|vinegars]] and [[Spices|spices]]- make small batches and taste test them as you go.  You will easily find a [[Vinegar|vinegar]] that suits your taste.\n===Chef's notes===\nIf you discover you've not made enough flavoured pickling vinegar to cover your pickles, just top the mixture up with normal malt vinegar.\n\nI've found some of these [[Vinegar|vinegar]] mixes so good that once the [[Pickles|pickles]] have been eaten, they are too good to discard, so I filter them again using a [[Paper towel|paper towel]] over a [[Sieve|sieve]] and re-use them as exotic [[Vinegars|vinegars]] for [[Salad dressings|salad dressings]] etc.\n===See also===\nOur [[:[[Category:Pickles and preserves]]|full range of pickle and preserve recipes]].\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Marinades dressings and butters]]\n[[Category:Pickles and preserves]]\n[[Category:Spicy recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegan recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes]]\n[[Category:Pickled]]\n[[Category:Boiled or simmered]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:12032020'>#vinegar #vinegars #pickles #maltvinegar #papertowel #picklesandpreserves #pickling #spices #sieve #jaggery #demerara</code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
