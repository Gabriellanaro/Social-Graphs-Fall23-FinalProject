They are at their best from March to September.\n\nThis tried and trusted recipe is from Mrs Beeton's Cookery Book, circa 1945.\n\nThe only change I would make to the recipe below is to use [[pre-rolled puff pastry]], and maybe omit the pigeons feet!.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 2 pigeons\n| 340 g (3/4 lb) [[rump steak]]\n| 75 g (3 oz) [[ham]] or lean [[bacon]]\n| 284 ml (1/2 pint) good [[stock]]\n| 1 hard-[[boiled]] [[egg]]\n| 1 [[egg]] yolk\n| 500g [[Puff-pastry]] - puff-paste in Beaton-speak.\n| [[Salt]] and [[pepper]]\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Cut each [[pigeon]] into 4 pieces\n| Cut the [[beef]] into small thin slices, the [[ham]] into strips and the [[eggs]] into slices\n| Put these ingredients into a pie dish in layers, season well and pour in the [[stock]] to three-quarters fill the dish\n| Put on the cover (''[[pre-rolled puff pastry]]''), [[brush]] over with yolk of [[egg]], [[bake]] in a ''quick oven'' (see below) until the paste has risen and set, then cook at a ''lower temperature'' (again, see below) for about 1 hour\n| Have ready a few of the [[pigeon]]'s feet, scalded and the toes cut off, also the remainder of the [[stock]]\n| Before serving, pour in the [[stock]] through the centre of the pie and replace the pastry ornament with the feet, fixing them in a nearly upright position\n| The pie may be served either hot or cold; if the latter, the stock must form a jelly when cold\n}}\n===Chef's tip===\n\n'''Quick oven''' 200\u00b0 C (400\u00b0 F - Gas 6)\n\n'''Lower temperature''' 150\u00b0 C (300\u00b0 C - Gas 2)\n\nI would cover the pastry with [[tin-foil]] during the ''lower temperature'' stage to ensure it does not get over-cooked. \n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes|Pigeon]]\n[[Category:Egg recipes|Pigeon]]\n[[Category:Historic recipes|Pigeon]]\n[[Category:Main courses|Pigeon]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes|Pigeon]]\n[[Category:Poultry recipes|Pigeon]]\n[[Category:Game recipes|Pigeon]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#stock #egg #ham #pigeon #bacon #bake #rumpsteak #beef #brush #unusualrecipes #eggs </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
