When dividing your dough, use a metal dough cutter as this will give a cleaner cut.\n==See also==\n* [[Plaited bread (TM)|Here]] is a recipe for making the [[bread]] in a [[Thermomix]].\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Bread and baking]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes]]\n[[Category:Favourite recipes]][[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#plaitedbread #egg #bread #dough #yeast #fridge #flour #oliveoil #thermomix #bake #miseenplace </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
