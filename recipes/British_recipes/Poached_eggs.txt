The trick is to swirl the water vigorously first and then gently lower the egg into the centre of the pan using a ladle or a saucer.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 1 Really fresh [[egg]], free-range if possible.\n| A pinch of [[sea salt]]\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| ''Don't attempt more than 2 eggs at a time in the same pan''\n| Fill a small frying pan about 4 cm (1.5\") with boiling water and lower heat to a simmer.\n| Add a pinch of [[sea salt]]\n| Break each egg into its own saucer\n| Slide each egg off the saucer into the water. Do both in a short space of time if you can\n| Wait 3 minutes...\n| Remove each egg with a slotted spoon\n| Allow each egg to drain properly, as soggy toast is horrible\n}}\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Poached egg in a saucepan gathering the white.jpg|The swirling water gathers up the white\nImage:Poached egg swirl the water.jpg|swirl the water with another spoon and then slip the egg into the middle of the pan\nImage:Perfect poached eggs recipe.jpg|Slide the egg off a saucer\n</gallery>\n===Chef's notes===\nDon't let the water boil, it will break up the egg white.\nDon't stir the water again.\nSkim the white residue if you wish.\n===Serving suggestions===\n* Serve with hot brown buttered toast, using only real butter.\n* Pat dry and refrigerate for later use in a [[salad]].\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Egg recipes]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Student recipes]]\n[[Category:Poached]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#poachedeggs #fresheggs #salad #poached #saucepan </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
