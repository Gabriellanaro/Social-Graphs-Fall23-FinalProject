I've often used [[Fruit|fruit]] in  savoury recipes but never with [[Strawberries|strawberries]].  They have a fantastic flavour and just the right amount of tartness to cut a fatty meat such as [[pork]].\n\nAs it's August, Morrison's (and probably every other supermarket) has [[Strawberries|strawberries]] on special offer - 2 x 400g cartons of British strawberries for \u00a33.00 so what you don't use in this recipe you can enjoy with a dollop of [[Soured cream|soured cream]] as a sweet.\n\n''Most of the preparation time is spent in allowing the cooked ingredients to cool''.\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| 200g fresh [[strawberries]]\n| 2 tablespoons [[Balsamic vinegar|balsamic vinegar]] (or [[Balsamic|balsamic]] glaze)\n| [[Juice]] and [[Zest|zest]] of 1 [[Lime|lime]]\n| 1 small [[Basil|basil]] plant (supermarket-type)\n| 5 tablespoons of [[Extra virgin Olive oil|extra virgin olive oil]]\n| 200g [[Halloumi cheese|halloumi cheese]], sliced to 5mm\n| 10 fresh [[Mint leaves|mint leaves]], finely chopped\n| A small bag of tender [[Salad|salad]] leaves\n| 1 small red onion, peeled and very thinly sliced\n| 120g selection of continental [[Meats|meats]] (eg: Morrisons '[[Spanish]] Platter')\n| [[Salt]] and [[Freshly ground black pepper|freshly ground black pepper]]\n}}\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:The easy way to remove the peduncle from a strawberry.jpg|300px|thumb|right|The easiest way I've found to remove the peduncle (''petiole'') from a strawberry is with a pair of long-nosed pliers\nImage:Morrison's Spanish Platter.jpg|300px|thumb|right|Morrison's Spanish platter (120g - \u00a32)\n</gallery>\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| Pick most of the [[Basil leaves|basil leaves]] and gently [[Fry|fry]] for 5 minutes in 5 tablespoons of [[Olive oil|olive oil]]\n| Allow to cool and drain the [[Oil|oil]] in a [[Sieve|sieve]] and discard the leaves\n| [[Fry]] the sliced [[Halloumi|halloumi]] in a [[Frying pan|frying pan]] or [[Griddle|griddle]] tray for 2 minutes a side, moistening the pan with a smear of [[Olive oil|olive oil]]\n| Remove the [[Cheese|cheese]] allow to cool, then chop into smaller slices\n| De-hull the [[Strawberries|strawberries]] (my long-nosed plier tip works brilliantly on strawberries that are not over-ripe).  Cut the strawberries into thin slices. \n| When the [[Basil|basil]] infused [[Oil|oil]] has cooled, mix it with the [[Juice|juice]] and [[Zest|zest]] of 1 [[Lime|lime]] and a pinch of [[Salt|salt]] and [[Black pepper|black pepper]]\n| Add the [[Strawberries|strawberries]] and the [[Oil|oil]] to a bowl and leave them until you are ready to put the dish together.  Drain and reserve the [[Strawberry|strawberry]]/[[Basil|basil]] oil to use a a final dressing.\n| With the cold sliced [[Halloumi|halloumi]] as a base, build the [[Salad|salad]] in layers with the salad leaves, mint leaves, sliced onions, Spanish meats and the remaining fresh basil leaves. Finally drizzle with the flavoured [[Olive oil|olive oil]].\n| This dish was fantastic, I loved the idea so much that some more [[Strawberries|strawberries]] have already been bought to go with Sunday's [[Roast pork|roast pork]]!\n}}\n===Variations===\nThis would make a brilliant [[Starter|starter]] and an impressive anti-pasta dish.\n\nMake a spicy version; use [[Hugh's fried halloumi]].\n{{SeeAlso-HalloumiRecipes}}\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Spanish recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Snacks and light bites]]\n[[Category:Starters]]\n[[Category:Tapas, mezze and antipasti]]\n[[Category:Fruit recipes]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:Pork recipes]]\n[[Category:Salad recipes]]\n[[Category:Grilled, griddled or barbecued]]\n[[Category:Favourite recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#strawberries #oliveoil #basil #halloumi #zest #porkandstrawberrysaladwithgrilledhalloumicheese #fry #salad #juice #lime #spanish </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
