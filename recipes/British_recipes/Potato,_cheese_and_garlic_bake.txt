My version is rather more powerful and rustic.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 4 bulbs [[Roasted garlic|roasted garlic]], squeezed\n| 500 g [[Potatoes|potatoes]], peeled\n| Large knob of [[Butter|butter]]\n| Splash of [[Milk|milk]]\n| [[White pepper]], freshly [[Ground|ground]]\n| 180 g [[Cornish Quartz cheese]]\n| 180 g [[Parmesan cheese]]\n| 70 g fresh [[Rye|rye]] [[Breadcrumbs|breadcrumbs]]\n| Fried, sliced [[Indian green chillies]], to taste (optional)\n\n}}\n\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n* Allow an hour beforehand to [[Roast|roast]] the [[Garlic|garlic]].  Grease a shallow [[Baking|baking]] dish with [[Butter|butter]].  \n* Keep the [[Oven|oven]] on at 180\u00b0 C (350\u00b0 F - gas 4)\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| [[Boil]] the [[Potatoes|potatoes]] until they are cooked.\n| Drain thoroughly and put through a [[Ricer|ricer]] with the [[Butter|butter]] and [[Milk|milk]].\n| Add the [[Pepper|pepper]], [[Garlic|garlic]] and [[Chillies|chillies]] (if using) and mix well.\n| Add 60 g each of the two [[Cheeses|cheeses]] and mix again.\n| Layer the bottom of the [[Baking|baking]] dish with half of the [[Potato|potato]] mixture.\n| Sprinkle a further 60 g each of the two [[Cheeses|cheeses]] over the top.\n| Season again and spread the rest of the [[Potato|potato]] mixture over the top.\n| Mix the remaining [[Cheese|cheese]] with the [[Breadcrumbs|breadcrumbs]] and sprinkle them onto the [[Potato|potato]] mixture.\n| [[Bake]] in the [[Oven|oven]] for about 25-30 minutes until the [[Cheese|cheese]] has crispened.\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe with [[Vegetables|vegetables]] and any suitable [[Sauce|sauce]].  Also good with [[Salad|salad]].\n===Variations===\nUse any combination of strong [[Cheese|cheese]] you like.  I would normally include some [[Fried|fried]] [[Chilli|chilli]] slices, but as my daughter is eating this as well, I have had to omit them on this occasion.\n===Chef's notes===\n[[Cornish Quartz cheese]] is available from '''[http://www.waitrose.com Waitrose]'''\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes|Potato, cheese and garlic bake]]\n[[Category:Cheese recipes|Potato, cheese and garlic bake]]\n[[Category:Chilli pepper recipes|Potato, cheese and garlic bake]]\n[[Category:British recipes|Potato, cheese and garlic bake]]\n[[Category:Garlic recipes|Potato, cheese and garlic bake]]\n[[Category:Main courses|Potato, cheese and garlic bake]]\n[[Category:Pies tarts and flans|Potato, cheese and garlic bake]]\n[[Category:Potato recipes|Potato, cheese and garlic bake]]\n[[Category:Spicy recipes|Potato, cheese and garlic bake]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes|Potato, cheese and garlic bake]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#potatocheeseandgarlicbake #cheese #butter #potato #garlic #breadcrumbs #baking #cheeses #cornishquartzcheese #potatoes #ricer </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
