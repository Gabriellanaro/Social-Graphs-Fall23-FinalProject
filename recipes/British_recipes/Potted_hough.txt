I have taken it verbatim from the wonderful, wonderful book; [[Cookbook: Food In England|Food in England - Dorothy Hartley]] which is now available again as it has been reprinted and re-issued. Recommended.\n\n===[[Servings]]===\n\nTwa-three slices o' potted hough per person!\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| [[Shin of beef]]\n| 3 [[black peppercorns]]\n|  A blade of [[mace]]\n}}\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Take the hough and bash it well with an axe.\n| No' just beark it, but have at it , 'till the pieces are no bigger than a wee hen's egg.\n| Pack it into an iron pot with the papery brown skins of onions, two or three peppercorns and a blade of mace. just cover with water, set on the lid lightly, and let it stew for four hours at least.\n| When the meat is away from the bone, tilt it all into a colander, strain the liquid back into the saucepan, and let it gallop while you are gathering up the meat from the broken [[bones]]. \n| Press the meat into a basin with straight sides, and when the meat is all in, fill up with the liquid and set aside 'til cold.\n| It should set stiff.  If it no' sets stiff, you must reduce again for it should be stiff as glue.\n}}\n===Scotch woman's tip===\n\nDo not add vegetables, or over-season with herbs, when cooking this dish, as\n\nit is not a 'made' dish, in the usual sense: it is most essentially a plain\n\ndish of solid meat.  It turns out a brawn, but the texture is much more firm.\n\nThe Scotch woman who gave me the recipe said \"All o' mie want no more than\n\ntwa-three slices o' potted hough, and a well of baked taties, and a fresh\n\nlettuce and mustard-maybe twa-three pickles would go wi' it well-and a tankard\n\nof ale-'twill fill them fine-'tis all guid meat\", and as she was a mother of\n\nfour champion blacksmiths she knew what she was strengthening.\n{{RecipeLine}}\n{{RecipeSkip}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Beef recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:historic recipes]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Stewed, braised or pot roasted]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:12032020'>#pottedhough #bones #beefrecipes #unusualrecipes #meatrecipes #recipes #historicrecipes #britishrecipes #maincourses #servings </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
