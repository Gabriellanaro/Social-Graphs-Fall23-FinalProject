If the juices run clear it is cooked, if not, cook another 5 minutes. \n|Leave quail (and black pudding) loosely covered in [[Foil|foil]], to rest for 5 minutes. \n|Meanwhile cut the top and bottom off the [[Apple|apple]] then cut it in half across the core to make 2 thick slices. \n|Remove the core.

Place the black pudding, with an apple slice on top, on two hot plates. Arrange the [[Quail|quail]] breasts and legs on top of that. \n|Heat the pan juices in the [[Roasting|roasting]] tin, adding a really good splash of [[Sherry|sherry]] or [[Wine|wine]] or water to [[Deglaze|deglaze]] it. Let it reduce a little then stir in cr\u00e8me fraiche, to taste, and fresh [[Thyme leaves|thyme leaves]].
