It is basically a hare [[Stew|stew]] with [[Vegetables|vegetables]].\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| [[Olive oil]]\n| 500 g [[Hare|hare]] [[Meat|meat]], chopped into very small pieces\n| Seasoning to taste\n| 1 large [[Onion|onion]], [[Diced|diced]]\n| 2 sticks [[Celery|celery]], [[Diced|diced]]\n| 2 [[Carrots|carrots]], [[Julienned|julienned]]\n| 2 bulbs [[Garlic|garlic]] or more, finely [[Diced|diced]]\n| 1 tin of chopped [[Tomatoes|tomatoes]]\n| [[Oregano]]\n| 4 [[Bay leaves|bay leaves]]\n| 150 ml [[Dry sherry|dry sherry]]\n| 75 ml [[Stock]], or more, if needed\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Heat a little [[Oil|oil]] in a large saucepan over a medium heat until it is [[Smoking|smoking]].\n| [[Brown]] the [[Hare|hare]] in batches of three, seasoning each batch before removing from pan.\n| Heat some more [[Oil|oil]] and [[Stew|stew]] the [[Onion|onion]], [[Carrots|carrots]] and [[Celery|celery]] until soft - stir from time to time.\n| Add in the [[Garlic|garlic]] and [[Stew|stew]] until golden.\n| Stir in the [[Tomatoes|tomatoes]], [[Herbs|herbs]] and [[Sherry|sherry]].\n| [[Simmer]] for 10 minutes and return the [[Hare|hare]] to the pan.\n| Reduce the heat and [[Simmer|simmer]] until the [[Hare|hare]] is cooked.\n| The [[Sauce|sauce]] should be thick, but you may need to top it up with small amounts of [[Stock|stock]] to stop it from being too thick or sticking.\n| Adjust seasoning if necessary.\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe on a plate of creamy [[Mashed potatoes|mashed potatoes]].\n===Variations===\nYou can use [[Rabbit|rabbit]] or [[Venison|venison]] instead of the [[Hare|hare]]. Add a square of bitter chocolate to the sauce if desired.\n===Chef's notes===\nHares are a lot larger than rabbits and as there is only one person in our household who will try it, the unused [[Meat|meat]] will form part of a mixed [[Game terrine|game terrine]].\n\nIf you are buying [[Hare|hare]] on the bone, once the [[Meat|meat]] has been removed, keep the [[bones]] in the [[Freezer|freezer]] to make [[Stock|stock]].  We have a 'bone bag' specifically for keeping [[bones]] and innards for [[stock]] making.\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes|Ragout of hare]]\n[[Category:British recipes|Ragout of hare]]\n[[Category:Game recipes|Ragout of hare]]\n[[Category:Garlic recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses|Ragout of hare]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes|Ragout of hare]]\n[[Category:Stews and casseroles|Ragout of hare]]\n[[Category:Vegetable recipes|Ragout of hare]]\n[[Category:Stewed, braised or pot roasted]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#ragoutofhare #hare #stock #diced #stew #simmer #onion #tomatoes #carrots #celery #bones </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
