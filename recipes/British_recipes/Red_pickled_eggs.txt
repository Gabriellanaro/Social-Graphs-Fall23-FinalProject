My next choice would be pre cooked, vacuum packed beetroot and in third place, you could use jarred [[Pickled beetroot|pickled beetroot]], drained from its [[Vinegar|vinegar]].\n\nFor this recipe, I have used the pre cooked vacuum packed [[Beetroot|beetroot]], as our nearest greengrocer is miles away.\n\n400g [[beetroot]] should yield about 200ml juice.  Do not overpack the jar with [[eggs]] otherwise parts of the [[eggs]] will not colour so well as others.  Therefore, use too few, rather than too many.\n\nIf you can get it, there is an excellent commercially produced '''[http://www.goodnessdirect.co.uk/cgi-local/frameset/detail/570112_Eden_Organic_Beetroot_Juice_750ml.html  organic beetroot juice]''' available.  It is so delicious, however, that you will probably want to drink it rather than use it for pickling!\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes|Pickled eggs red]]\n[[Category:British recipes|Pickled eggs red]]\n[[Category:Egg recipes|Pickled eggs red]]\n[[Category:Pickles and preserves|Pickled eggs red]]\n[[Category:Snacks and light bites|Pickled eggs red]]\n[[Category:Vegetable recipes|Pickled eggs red]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes|Pickled eggs red]]\n[[Category:Pickled]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#beetroot #eggs #juice #redpickledeggs #vinegar #pickledbeetroot #miseenplace #unusualrecipes #cocktailstick #pickling </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
