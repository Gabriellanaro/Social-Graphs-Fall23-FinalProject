This is my slightly modified version.  A nice meal for a hot summers evening that would also work as a starter or meze.\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| 5 large ripe [[Apricots|apricots]]\n| Zest and juice of half a [[lemon]]\n| 2 tablespoons of [[honey]] - '''Tip:''' Microwave ''set'' honey for 5 seconds to make it runny\n| 10g of [[butter]]\n| 20 pistachio nuts\n| 100g [[goats cheese|goat's cheese]]\n| 2 slices of orange\n}}\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n\n* As most supermarkets seem to sell [[Fruit|fruit]] that is as hard as bullets, it might be an idea to buy your fruit ahead of time to allow them to ripen properly first.\n* Preheat your [[Oven|oven]] to 180\u00b0 C (350\u00b0 F - gas 4), [fan oven 160\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]\n\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| Separate the [[Apricots|apricots]] by cutting round the middle and twisting the two halves apart. Pick out the stones and discard.  Remove any stubborn left-over bits with a sharp knife.\n| Wipe the base of a small [[Roasting tray|roasting tray]] with [[Butter|butter]] paper or [[Olive oil|olive oil]].\n| Sit the [[Apricots|apricots]] in the tray so they are an array of ''cups''.\n| fill each ''[[Cup|cup]]'' with a dot of [[Butter|butter]], half a teaspoon of [[Honey|honey]], a squeeze of [[Lemon|lemon]] and a pinch of [[Salt|salt]].\n| [[Roast]] for 15 minutes or until the [[Fruit|fruit]] is gooey and runny.\n| After 15 minutes, add a teaspoon of [[Goat|goat]]'s [[Cheese|cheese]] to each [[Apricot|apricot]] and [[Roast|roast]] for a further 5 minutes to soften the cheese.\n| Shell the [[Pistachios|pistachios]], pop them in a clean [[Tea-towel|tea-towel]] and smash them to crumbs with a [[Rolling pin|rolling pin]].\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe the warm [[Apricots|apricots]] on a bed of [[Rocket|rocket]], lightly dressed with [[Olive oil|olive oil]].\n\nSprinkle with crushed [[Pistachios|pistachios]] and dress with [[Orange|orange]] slices.\n===Recipe source===\n\n* Lindsey Bareham, The Times newspaper, Thursday 15th June 2017\n===Variations===\nTry this with other seasonal [[Fruits|fruits]] like [[Nectarines|nectarines]] or even a couple of [[Peaches|peaches]].\n\nA few freshly picked, torn [[basil]] leaves complemented this well.\n\nI wonder if a little [[Roquefort|roquefort]] blue in place of the [[Goat|goat]]'s [[Cheese|cheese]] might be nice too?\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:French recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Snacks and light bites]]\n[[Category:Starters]]\n[[Category:Tapas, mezze and antipasti]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes]]\n[[Category:Cheese recipes]]\n[[Category:Fruit recipes]]\n[[Category:Salad recipes]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n[[Category:Favourite recipes]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#apricots #roastapricotsgoatscheesesaladwithpistachios #butter #honey #fruit #roast #pistachios #lemon #cheese #oliveoil #goat </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
