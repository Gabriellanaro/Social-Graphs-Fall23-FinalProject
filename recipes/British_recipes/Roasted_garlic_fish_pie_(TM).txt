Varoma / Speed Spoon'''.\n| Check the [[Potatoes|potatoes]] have been properly cooked and is necessary, cook a few minutes more until tender.\n| Drain the [[Potatoes|potatoes]] and reserve the [[Steaming|steaming]] water.\n| Insert the '''Butterfly Whisk''' and add the butter, [[Steaming|steaming]] water, [[Milk|milk]] or [[Cream|cream]], [[Nutmeg|nutmeg]] and seasoning with the [[Potatoes|potatoes]].\n| Mix '''2-10 seconds / Speed 4''' depending on the desired consistency - I find that 4 seconds is about right.\n| Spread the [[Potato|potato]] over the [[Fish|fish]] mixture and sprinkle with breadcrumbs.\n| Dot some small pieces of [[Butter|butter]] over the [[Potato|potato]].\n| [[Bake]] at 220\u00b0 C (425\u00b0 F - gas 7), [fan [[Oven|oven]] 200\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour] for 30-40 minutes until golden [[Brown|brown]].\n| ('''AGA [[Ovens|ovens]]''':  [[Bake]] 30 minutes on rack set on lowest set of runners in the [[Roasting]] [[Oven]].)\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe with [[Steamed|steamed]] [[Peas|peas]] or [[Broccoli|broccoli]].\n===Recipe source===\n* Adapted from a recipe in '''Fast and Easy Cooking''', the [[Thermomix]] UK recipe book.\n===Variations===\nYou can also use [[Prawns|prawns]] or [[scallops]] in place of the some of the [[Fish|fish]].  You can cover with [[Puff pastry|puff pastry]] instead of [[Potato|potato]] if preferred.  Add some [[Garlic|garlic]] and/or [[onion]] - this will need be [[saut\u00e9ed]] in the TM bowl '''before''' [[steaming]] the [[fish]].\n===Chef's notes===\nUsually I find that the [[potatoes]] need cooking for 20 minutes.  If bubbling liquid starts to come through the lid, increase spees to 2.  It is best to allow the [[fish]] mixture to cool, before adding the [[potato]] or it will sink too much into the [[fish]] [[sauce]].\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Garlic recipes]]\n[[Category:Fish recipes]]\n[[Category:Potato recipes]]\n[[Category:Sea fish recipes]]\n[[Category:Thermomix recipes]]\n[[Category:Favourite recipes]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#fish #potatoes #steaming #butter #potato #garlic #thermomix #cornflour #bake #cream #mashedpotato </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
