However it is perfectly possible to slow cook a turkey crown, turkey breast or a turkey leg.\n\nIn the UK our local supermarket (Morrisons) sell a 1600g [3.5 lb] [[Turkey|turkey]] leg, separated into two pieces for just \u00a34.50, compared to \u00a324 for a turkey crown.  The leg is ideal for prolonged cooking and it '''''will''''' [[Roast|roast]] in the [[Slow cooker|slow cooker]].\n\nI've used a massive amount of [[Fresh herbs|fresh herbs]] from our garden to give this joint masses of flavour.\n\nThe [[Roasting|roasting]] occurs because the [[Turkey|turkey]] is kept out of the [[Stock|stock]] by sitting it on 5 or 6 balls of scrunched up [[Baking|baking]] [[Foil|foil]], a large [[Onion|onion]], halved and a bed of [[Herbs|herbs]].  I've used 500 ml of stock and 6 rashers of streaky [[Bacon|bacon]] to prevent the turkey from [[Drying|drying]] out. Plus some [[Garlic|garlic]] for extra flavour.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| 1.6kg [1lb 8oz] [[Turkey|turkey]] leg (separated)\n| 6 rashers of streaky [[Bacon|bacon]]\n| 1 large [[Onion|onion]], unpeeled and cut into two halves\n| 5 [[Cloves of garlic|cloves of garlic]], unpeeled and smashed under the flat of a knife\n| Large pinch of [[Freshly ground black pepper|freshly ground black pepper]]\n| Large bunch of [[Fresh herbs|fresh herbs]]. ([[Sage|sage]], [[Rosemary|rosemary]], [[Thyme|thyme]], etc). I also added the remains of a bunch of [[Dill|dill]]\n| [[Olive oil]]\n}}\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n\n* [[Roasting a chicken in a slow cooker]] - [[Tin foil|tin foil]], rub and [[Stuffing|stuffing]].jpg\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Roast turkey and trimmings.jpg|Served with [[roast potatoes]] and [[roasted vegetables]] that were cooked in a conventional oven\nImage:Cooking turkey leg in a slow cooker prepped.jpg|Prepped and ready for 10 hours of slow cooking\nImage:Cooking turkey leg in a slow cooker ingredients.jpg|The basic ingredients - all that turkey for \u00a34.50!\nImage:Roasting a turkey leg in a slow cooker - tin foil balls.jpg|Scrunch up the baking foil into small balls to give the turkey some support and keep it dry so it can roast\n</gallery>\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| Loosely scrunch up 5 or 6 balls of [[Baking|baking]] [[Foil|foil]] and place in the base of the [[Slow cooker|slow cooker]]\n| Arrange the [[Onion|onion]] halves where they will provide the best support for the [[Turkey|turkey]] leg\n| Distribute the smashed [[Garlic|garlic]] in the base of the [[Cooker|cooker]] and make a bed with your [[Fresh herbs|fresh herbs]]\n| Make up 500 ml ( almost a pint) of [[Chicken stock|chicken stock]] and pour this into the base of the [[Cooker|cooker]]\n| Lay the [[Turkey|turkey]] leg on the bed of [[Herbs|herbs]] and drizzle with a little [[Olive oil|olive oil]] and sprinkle with the [[Black pepper|black pepper]]\n| Lay the rashers of streaky [[Bacon|bacon]] over the leg\n| Loosely cover with a sheet of [[Baking|baking]] [[Foil|foil]]\n| Pop the lid on and slow cook on low for 10 hours\n| You could prepare this the night before and set the [[Slow cooker|slow cooker]] on a timer if you wanted to have this in the middle of the day\n| Discard the bacon rashers as they will now be tasteless, all their flavour has gone into the turkey and the stock.\n| Use the [[Stock|stock]] as [[Gravy|gravy]], thickening it with a tablespoon of [[gravy granules]] or few teaspoons of [[Cornflour|cornflour]] if needed\n| Carve and serve!\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe with [[Roast potatoes|roast potatoes]] and all the trimmings\n==See also==\n\n* [[Roasting a chicken in a slow cooker]]\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:North American recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:Poultry recipes]]\n[[Category:Slow cooker recipes]]\n[[Category:Slow cooked]]\n[[Category:Cookery cheats]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#turkey #slowcooker #foil #onion #bacon #baking #freshherbs #roastingaturkeyinaslowcooker #stock #oliveoil #garlic </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
