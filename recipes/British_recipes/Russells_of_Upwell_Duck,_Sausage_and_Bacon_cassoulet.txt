where the original version of this recipe can be commonly found.\n\nThis is my own recipe based on [[Treacle Cured Bacon from Russell's of Upwell's]], bacon I can buy from the [[Butchers|butchers]] I can see across the fields from my office and spare 'left-over' items.\n\nThis recipe is cooked in the [[Slow-cooker|slow-cooker]]; just starting off in a cast [[Iron|iron]] [[Frying pan|frying pan]] to [[Brown|brown]] the [[Duck|duck]], [[Sausages|sausages]] and [[Onions|onions]].\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| 1 large [[Duck|duck]] leg, skin on, from Russell's of Upwell if you're lucky enough to live in Norfolk!\n| 3 [[Pork sausages|pork sausages]] from Russell's of Upwell\n| 3 rashers of [[Treacle Cured Bacon from Russell's of Upwell's]] - (fatty back bacon [[Cured|cured]] in [[Black treacle|black treacle]])\n| 1 large [[Onion|onion]], peeled and chopped\n| 3 [[Fat|fat]] [[Cloves of Garlic, peeled and crushed|cloves of garlic, peeled and crushed]]\n| 1 teaspoon [[Sherry vinegar|sherry vinegar]]\n| 2 [[Thin Indian green chillies|thin indian green chillies]], left whole\n| 1 large [[Portobello mushroom|portobello mushroom]], chopped\n| 1 400g can of chopped [[Tomatoes|tomatoes]]\n| 1 400g can of [[Butter beans|butter beans]]\n| 300 ml [[Chicken stock|chicken stock]]\n| Big pinch of [[Taste Sensation Italian seasoning]]\n| Pinch of [[Sea Salt|sea salt]]\n| &#189;
