This version uses [[Salmon|salmon]] as an alternative and to satisfy my husband's constant need for [[Garlic|garlic]] and [[chilli]], they have been included.  You may, of course, leave them out.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 1 litre light [[Fish stock|fish stock]] or [[Court bouillon|court bouillon]]\n| 1 teaspoon [[Chilli powder|chilli powder]]\n| 1 tablespoon [[Garlic powder|garlic powder]]\n| 500 g [[Salmon|salmon]]\n| 15-20 ml [[Olive oil|olive oil]]\n| 400 g [[Basmati rice|basmati rice]]\n| 5 tablespoons [[Butter|butter]]\n| 3 [[Hard boiled eggs|hard boiled eggs]], chopped\n| 2 tablespoons flat-leaved [[Parsley|parsley]], chopped\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Bring the [[Fish stock|fish stock]] to a gentle [[Simmer|simmer]] in a pan.\n| Meanwhile, mix the [[Chilli|chilli]] and [[Garlic|garlic]] powders together.\n| Mix with a little of the [[Fish stock|fish stock]] and add to the pan.\n| Gently [[Poach|poach]] the [[Salmon|salmon]] in the [[Stock|stock]] for about 5 minutes.\n| Remove from pan, and pour [[Stock|stock]] into a jug.\n| Using the same pan, heat the [[Olive oil|olive oil]].\n| Add the [[Rice|rice]] and stir for a minute or two.\n| Remove from heat and add 800 ml of the [[Fish stock|fish stock]].  If you have less than that, make up with water.\n| Cover and [[Simmer|simmer]] until the [[Rice|rice]] has absorbed the liquid (about 15 minutes).\n| Meanwhile, preheat [[Oven|oven]] to 160\u00b0 C (325\u00b0 F - gas 3).\n| [[Flake]] and bone the [[Fish|fish]].  Skin if desired.\n| When the [[Rice|rice]] is cooked, stir in the [[Fish|fish]] and the [[Butter|butter]].\n| Transfer to a [[Baking|baking]] dish and cover with [[Tin foil|tin foil]].  Prick a a few holes in the [[Tin foil|foil]]\n| [[Bake]] for 15-20 minutes and remove from [[Oven|oven]].\n| Garnish with the chopped [[Egg|egg]] and [[Parsley|parsley]].\n}}\n===Variations===\nTry with any [[Fish|fish]] that flakes easily.  Choose [[Spices|spices]] according to taste.  If you like a smoked flavour and use non-smoked salmon. add 1 teaspoon [[Paprika#Piment\u00f3n de La Vera|Piment\u00f3n de La Vera dulce]] to the [[chilli]] and [[garlic powder]].  Use fresh, crushed [[Garlic|garlic]] instead of the powder.\n==See also==\n[[Buttery kedgeree]], a version based on Delia's book recipe and [['Greasy spoon' kedgeree]] which speaks for itself.\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes|Salmon kedgeree]]\n[[Category:Egg recipes|Salmon kedgeree]]\n[[Category:Chilli pepper recipes]]\n[[Category:British recipes|Salmon kedgeree]]\n[[Category:Fish recipes|Salmon kedgeree]]\n[[Category:Garlic recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses|Salmon kedgeree]]\n[[Category:Sea fish recipes|Salmon kedgeree]]\n[[Category:Spicy recipes|Salmon kedgeree]]\n[[Category:Breakfast recipes|Salmon k]]\n[[Category:Poached]][[Category:Baked or roasted]][[Category:Boiled or simmered]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#salmonkedgeree #fishstock #fish #rice #salmon #chilli #garlic #oliveoil #stock #simmer #butter </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
