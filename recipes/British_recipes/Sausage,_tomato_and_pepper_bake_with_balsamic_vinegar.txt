Even small [[New Potatoes|new potatoes]] would work well, although they might need to be [[Par-boiled|par-boiled]] for 15 minutes first just to ensure they soften up.  They would be great to soak up the dark sticky [[Gravy|gravy]].\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| 1 medium [[Onion|onion]], peeled and sliced\n| 4 [[Debbie and Andrew's Harrogate 97% Pork Sausages]]\n| 3 [[Cloves of Garlic, peeled and crushed|cloves of garlic, peeled and crushed]]\n| 1 [[Yellow pepper|yellow pepper]], [[Seeds|seeds]] removed and sliced\n| 1 teaspoon [[Dried oregano|dried oregano]]\n| 350g [[Cherry tomatoes|cherry tomatoes]], left uncut\n| 1 [[Sprig of rosemary|sprig of rosemary]]\n| 1 sprig of [[Thyme|thyme]]\n| 2 [[Bay leaves|bay leaves]]\n| 3 tablespoons [[balsamic vinegar]]\n| 3 tablespoons of [[Olive oil|olive oil]]\n| [[Sea Salt|sea salt]] and [[Freshly ground black pepper|freshly ground black pepper]]\n}}\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n\n* Preheat your [[Oven|oven]] to 190\u00b0 C (375\u00b0 F - gas 5), [fan oven 170\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]\n\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| Chose a fairly small [[Baking tray|baking tray]] and add 2 tablespoons of [[Olive oil|olive oil]] and a good grind of [[Black pepper|black pepper]].\n| Pop the [[Oven|oven]] try on the [[Hob|hob]] and put it on a high heat.\n| Add the [[Sausages|sausages]], sliced [[sweet pepper]] and the sliced [[Onions|onions]] and [[Brown|brown]] them.  You'll need to keep moving them about because they won't heat as evenly as they would in a [[Frying pan|frying pan]].\n| Once everything has taken a tiny bit of colour, add the [[Garlic|garlic]] and [[Stir-fry|stir-fry]] for a minute or so, then remove the tray from the heat.\n| Add the halved [[Tomatoes|tomatoes]], [[Herbs|herbs]] and [[Balsamic vinegar|balsamic vinegar]] to the sausages and stir well.\n| Season with a pinch of [[Salt|salt]] and pour over the remaining [[Olive oil|olive oil]].\n| [[Bake]] in the top half of the [[Oven|oven]] for 30 minutes, then mix everything up again and cook for a further 30 minutes.\n| If the gravy looks to be too liquid, place the baking tray on the hob on a high heat for 5 minutes, stirring now and then.\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe from the [[Oven|oven]] dish with slices of stoneground [[Bread|bread]] to soak up the delicious [[Gravy|gravy]].\n===Chef's notes===\nAlthough this [[Debbie and Andrew's]] recipe suggests heating the [[sausages]], [[peppers]], [[onions]] et al, in a [[roasting tray]], I found it more convenient to do the [[browning]] in a large [[wok]] or [[frying pan]] and then transfer the part-cooked items to a preheated [[roasting tray]] and finish in the [[oven]].\n\nThe original recipe suggested halving the [[tomatoes]] but after making this dish many times I think it's nicer to leave them whole.  There's less liquid produces and you get the exquisite flavour bombs everytime you bite into one.\n===Variations===\nAdd a chopped deseeded dried [[Chile de Arbole]] for a livelier version!\n\nSliced [[mushrooms]] added a nice meaty bite to this dish.\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:Pork recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegetable recipes]]\n[[Category:Debbie&andrew's sausage recipes]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n[[Category:Pan fried]]\n[[Category:Recipes from other sites]]\n[[Category:Favourite recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#gravy #oliveoil #sausagetomatoandpepperbakewithbalsamicvinegar #tomatoes #balsamicvinegar #onions #roastingtray #bake #sausages #newpotatoes #vegetables </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
