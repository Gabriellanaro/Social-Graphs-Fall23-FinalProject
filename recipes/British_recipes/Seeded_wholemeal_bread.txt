I was feeling lazy today and made this in my [[Breadmaker|breadmaker]].  The recipe is designed to be made with a Panasonic breadmaker.  Depending on your model, add the [[Seeds|seeds]] to the [[Nut|nut]] dispenser or into the pan when your machine bleeps.  For other [[Breadmakers|breadmakers]], follow your manufacturer's instructions regarding the order in which you add your ingredients.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 1&frac14; teaspoons fast action [[Dried yeast|dried yeast]]\n| 550g [[Strong wholemeal flour|strong wholemeal flour]] (I like to use Waitrose Very Strong Canadian [[Wholemeal flour|wholemeal flour]])\n| 1&frac12; teaspoons [[Granulated sugar|granulated sugar]]\n| 25g [[Butter|butter]]\n| 1&frac12; teaspoons [[Salt|salt]]\n| 360ml sparkling water\n| 2 tablespoons each of [[Linseeds|linseeds]], [[Sesame seeds|sesame seeds]], [[Pumpkin seeds|pumpkin seeds]], black [[Mustard seeds|mustard seeds]] and [[Sunflower seeds|sunflower seeds]]\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Add the ingredients (except the [[Seeds|seeds]]) in to your machine in the order given - non-Panasonic owners should refer to their manufacturer's instructions as to the order you should add them.\n| If you have a [[Nut|nut]] dispenser, place the [[Seeds|seeds]] into it.\n| Set to Whole [[Wheat]] - [[Bake]] [[Raisin]] and the [[Bread|bread]] will be [[Baked|baked]] in 5 hours.\n| For Panasonic machines without a dispenser, add the [[Seeds|seeds]] when you hear the beep.\n| For other machines, select a [[Wholemeal|wholemeal]] programme which kneads for roughly 15-10 minutes, rises for at least 2 hours 20 minutes and bakes for around 50 minutes.\n| When the [[Baking|baking]] time has ended, remove from the pan and allow to cool for at least 20 minutes before slicing.\n| Again, other makes of machine may recommend that the loaf should be left in the pan before the final cooling.\n}}\n===Variations===\nVary the [[Seeds|seeds]] if desired, but ensure that you restrict your large seeds to two and use three smaller seeds.  A suggestion for large ones is [[Melon|melon]] seeds.  Smaller seeds could include [[Poppy|poppy]], [[Celery|celery]], yellow [[Mustard|mustard]], [[Nigella|nigella]], [[Chilli|chilli]] etc\n===Chef's notes===\nRemember that the addition of ingredients such as [[Seeds|seeds]] will give a heavier [[Dough|dough]], which is why I recommend using Canadian [[Wheat flour|wheat flour]] which is very strong.  If your usual [[Wholemeal flour|wholemeal flour]] makes a denser loaf, you could add a crushed [[Vitamin C tablet|vitamin C tablet]] to the [[Flour|flour]].  It is to your personal taste.\n==See also==\n{{Wholemeal bread recipes-See also}}\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Bread and baking]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes]]\n[[Category:Breadmaker recipes]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#seeds #seededwholemealbread #nut #bread #wholemealflour #granulatedsugar #flour #chilli #wholemeal #strongwholemealflour #sesameseeds </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
