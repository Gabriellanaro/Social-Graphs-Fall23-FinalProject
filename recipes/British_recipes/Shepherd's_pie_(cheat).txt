Sprinkle the [[gravy granules]] or [[stock cube]] over the mixture, add a dash of [[Worcestershire sauce]] and give it one final mix.\n| Carefully layer the [[mashed potato]] on the top and using a fork, create plenty of peaks so they brown and crisp during the baking.\n| Top with [[grated]] [[cheese]] and [[bake]] for 20 minutes until the top is golden-brown.\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe with peas.\n==See also==\n* [[Shepherds' pie recipes|other shepherds' pie recipes]]\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes|Shepherd's pie]]\n[[Category:British recipes|Shepherd's pie]]\n[[Category:Cookery cheats|Shepherd's pie]]\n[[Category:Lamb recipes|Shepherd's pie]]\n[[Category:Main courses|Shepherd's pie]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes|Shepherd's pie]]\n[[Category:Mutton recipes|Shepherd's pie]]\n[[Category:Potato recipes|Shepherd's pie]]\n[[Category:Student recipes]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#garlic #onions #cream #worcestershiresauce #bakedbeans #gravygranules #butter #potatoes #blackpepper #miseenplace #stockcube </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
