If it tastes anything like as good as [[Beef Wellington]], the recipe on which it is based, it should be fantastic.\n\nThe origin of the recipe is purported to satisfy the requirement of a very rich and fulfilling meal that could be easily transported when hunting and shooting.  Sounds feasible!\n\nIt's pretty simple really; A loaf of [[Bread|bread]], hollowed out and filled with a sandwich of [[Beef|beef]] steaks that are stuffed with a layer of [[Duxelles|duxelles]] ([[Shallots|shallots]], [[Mushrooms|mushrooms]], [[Garlic|garlic]], [[Butter|butter]], [[Thyme|thyme]] and seasoning).  The loaf is then pressed under a heavy weight to flatten it - making it easier to carry I imagine\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 300g good quality [[Beef|beef]] steaks not too thick\n| 250 g [[Mushrooms|mushrooms]]\n| 4 [[Shallots|shallots]], peeled and finely chopped\n| 2 Cloves of [[Garlic|garlic]], peeled and crushed - or to taste\n| 4 tablespoons of [[Butter|butter]] (or butter / [[Oil|oil]] mixture)\n| 50 ml [[Dry sherry|dry sherry]]\n| Splash of [[Lemon juice|lemon juice]]\n| Sprig of [[Thyme|thyme]]\n| [[Sea Salt|sea salt]] and [[Freshly ground black pepper|freshly ground black pepper]]\n| A splash of interesting [[Sauce|sauce]] to liven it up a little - [[Worcestershire sauce]], [[Chilli sauce|chilli sauce]] etc.\n| 1 suitably shaped loaf of [[Bread|bread]] that is to your taste.  Most recipes seem to use white bread but I prefer wholemeal. \n}}\n===Method===\n\n\n''' [[Duxelles]]:'''\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Gently saut\u00e9 [[Garlic|garlic]] and [[Shallots|shallots]] in the  the finely chopped [[Mushrooms|mushrooms]] in the [[Butter|butter]] for about 6 minutes until soft.\n| Add the chopped [[Mushrooms|mushrooms]] and the whole sprig of [[Thyme|thyme]] and gently cook for 10 minutes so most of the [[Mushroom|mushroom]] [[Liquor|liquor]] is cooked off.\n| remove the sprig of [[thyme]]\n| Add the [[Wine|wine]], a splash of [[lemon juice]] and season to taste.\n| Cook gently until all of the liquid has gone.\n| The [[Duxelles|duxelles]] should stick together easily.\n| Remove from the heat and allow to cool.\n}}\n'''[[Steak]]'''\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Hammer the steak really well with a [[steak mallet]] so it is quite thin and almost doubled in size.  Cut into two pieces.\n| [[Fry]] the steaks to your liking in a little [[Butter|butter]] or [[Olive|olive]] - drain any excess [[Fat|fat]] after [[Frying|frying]]\n}}\n'''[[Bread]]'''\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Slice a 'lid' off the loaf, leaving enough room in the remaining loaf to stuff with the steaks and [[Duxelles|duxelles]]\n| Hollow out the lid and loaf and discard or whizz up in a [[Food-processor|food-processor]] to make [[Breadcrumbs|breadcrumbs]] for another time\n| Lay the first [[Steak|steak]] in the base of the loaf - trim and arrange to fit, see photos\n| Add the [[Duxelles|duxelles]] mixture\n| At this point you could add spread with some [[English mustard]] or [[Horseradish sauce|horseradish sauce]].  I [[Fried|fried]] the steaks in [[Chilli oil|chilli oil]] so have omitted this step\n| Cover with the remaining [[Steak|steak]]\n| Replace the 'lid'\n| Wrap in [[Greaseproof paper|greaseproof paper]] and tie with [[kitchen string]].\n| Wrap in a [[Tea-towel|tea-towel]] and press under a heavy weight for 24 hours.\n| The garage seemed the safest place to leave this, judging by the attention the cats were giving it!\n| I pressed the loaf between a plate and a cutting board, under a very heavy car tool-kit.\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe in slices\n===Variations===\nI'm thinking....\n===Chef's notes===\nA few comments after making this.  I have now halved the amount of meat originally used - go for quality, not quantity.  The taste was fantastic but there was too much meat and it was quite chewy unless sliced very thinly.\n\n[[Hammer the meat flat]] to reduce the thickness and also to tenderise it.\n\nUse the best quality steak you can afford.\n\nDon't worry about over-pressing it!  My pressing method was the tool-box pictured, almost full of car tools, spanners, hammers etc.  So heavy that it was almost not possible to lift it onto the workbench.  I checked it first thing in the morning, panicking and thinking it would like as flat as a tortilla.  It was not - it could easily have been left for another day.\n\n==Step by step photographs==\n===Making Duxelles===\n<gallery widths=270px heights=270px perrow=5>\nImage:Duxelles ingredients.jpg|The basic ingredients for [[duxelles]]\nImage:Shallots and garlic suateed in butter.jpg|[[Shallots]] and [[Garlic|garlic]] [[saut\u00e9ed]] in [[butter]]\nImage:Mushrooms chopped.jpg|Mushrooms chopped in the [[food processor]]\nImage:Mushrooms go in dry.jpg|The [[mushrooms]] look very dry when they are first added\nImage:White wine added.jpg|Wet again once the [[white wine]]/[[sherry]] is added\nImage:Duxelles reduced, ready to cool.jpg|[[Duxelles]] completed, ready to cool\n</gallery>\n===Assembling a Shooter's Sandwich===\n<gallery widths=270px heights=270px perrow=5>\nImage:Shooter's sandwich - Duxelles prepared and ready.jpg|Duxelles prepared and ready\nImage:Shooter's sandwich - Loaf separated and hollowed out.jpg|Loaf separated and hollowed out\nImage:Shooter's sandwich - First steak added.jpg|First steak added\nImage:Shooter's sandwich - Topped with duxelles.jpg|Topped with duxelles\nImage:Shooter's sandwich - Covered with the final steak.jpg|Covered with the final steak\nImage:Shooter's sandwich - Wrapped in grease-proof paper.jpg|Wrapped in grease-proof paper, tied with string\nImage:Shooter's sandwich - Pressed under a heavy weight.jpg|In the garage, away from the cats for 24 hours\nImage:Shooter's sandwich recipe.jpg|A Shooter's sandwich\n</gallery>\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Historic recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Beef recipes]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:Cooking with wine]]\n[[Category:Favourite recipes]]\n[[Category:Pan fried]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#shooterssandwich #duxelles #mushrooms #butter #shallots #thyme #garlic #steak #bread #beef #lemonjuice </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
