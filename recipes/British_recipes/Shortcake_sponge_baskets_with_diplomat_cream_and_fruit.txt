Each component will keep well in the [[Fridge|fridge]] for 3 days at least.\n\nYou will need a special tin to make the baskets. I used Nordic Ware's Shortcake Basket Tin and not sure if anyone else makes them. They can be got from [https://www.amazon.co.uk/Nordic-Ware-Platinum-Shortcake-Basket/dp/B000Q7QI3U?ie=UTF8&psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o03_s00 Amazon]\n{{RecipeIngredients\n}}\n====For the Shortcake Sponge:====\n{{RecipeIngredientsNB\n| 150g [[Plain flour|plain flour]], sieved with\n| 1.5 teaspoons [[Baking powder|baking powder]]\n| 1/4 teaspoons [[Salt|salt]]\n| 140g [[Caster Sugar|caster sugar]]\n| 1 [[free range egg]]\n| 1/2 a teaspoon of [[Vanilla|vanilla]] or other extract of your choice\n| 150g softened [[Butter|butter]]\n}}\n====For the Cr\u00e8me P\u00e2tissi\u00e8re ====\n{{RecipeIngredientsNB\n| 4g leaf [[Gelatine|gelatine]] (optional) \u2013 the 'set' version only\n| 50g [[Egg yolks|egg yolks]]\n| 60g [[Caster Sugar|caster sugar]]\n| 25g [[Cornflour|cornflour]]\n| 250g [[Milk|milk]]\n| 25g [[Butter|butter]]\n}}\n====For the Cr\u00e8me Chantilly====\n{{RecipeIngredientsNB\n| 200g [[Double Cream|double cream]] (chilled)\n| 40g [[Icing Sugar|icing sugar]]\n| 1 teaspoon [[Vanilla extract|vanilla extract]]\n}}\n====To finish====\n{{RecipeIngredientsNB\n| 36 [[Cherries]] or other small [[Fruit|fruit]] as desired\n| 15g [[Icing Sugar|icing sugar]]\n}}\n\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n}}\n====For the Shortcake Sponge:====\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Pre-heat the [[Oven|oven]] to 180C / 350F / Gas 4 (see [[Chef's notes|chef's notes]] below for fan oven instructions)\n| Mix all of the ingredients together.\n| Beat for 2 minutes using a medium speed\n| Taste and add more [[Vanilla|vanilla]] etc extract if necessary\n| Grease the tin with melted [[Butter|butter]] and lightly dust with [[Flour|flour]]. If using the Nordic Ware tin, I suggest you paint the butter on with a [[Pastry|pastry]] [[Brush|brush]] to make sure you get into all the crevices.\n| Divide the mixture into the 6 moulds. If you fill to the last basket market, that should be about right.\n| [[Bake]] for about 20 minutes.\n| Leave in the tin for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a [[Cooling rack|cooling rack]] and allow to go completely cold.\n| The sponges should have an interior texture of a cross between normal sponge [[Cake|cake]] and a nicely [[Baked|baked]] scone. Do not expect them to be like a Victoria [[Sandwich]] as that type of sponge won\u00c2\u2019t be strong enough to hold the filling.\n| When cold, reserve the sponges until ready for use. They can go into an [[Airtight container|airtight container]] in the [[Fridge|fridge]] if necessary.\n}}\n====For the Cr\u00e8me  Diplomate (This will probably make more than you need)====\n{{RecipeMethod\n| This is made in two parts \u2013 the Cr\u00e8me P\u00e2tissi\u00e8re and the Cr\u00e8me Chantilly \u2013 which are then mixed together. You can either make it a 'set' version or an 'unset' one. The 'set' one requires the use of [[Gelatine|gelatine]] to set the Cr\u00e8me P\u00e2tissi\u00e8re, but I chose to do the 'unset' one, being a [[Vegetarian|vegetarian]]. It may be possible to use [[Agar|agar]]-agar as a setting agent, but this will need some experimentation because agar behaves differently to gelatine. I would make the Cr\u00e8me P\u00e2tissi\u00e8re first as that need to cool.\n}}\n====For the Cr\u00e8me P\u00e2tissi\u00e8re ====\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Hydrate the [[Gelatine|gelatine]] (if using).\n| Beat the [[Egg yolks|egg yolks]] with the [[Sugar|sugar]].\n| Whisk in the [[Cornflour|cornflour]].\n| Bring the [[Milk|milk]] to the [[Boil|boil]] in a [[Saucepan|saucepan]], the pour half of the milk over the [[Egg|egg]] mixture.\n| Whisk, return to the [[Saucepan|saucepan]] and heat, whisking thoroughly.\n| As the mixture thickens, carry on whisking.\n| When it returns to the [[Boil|boil]], cook for 45 seconds and remove from the heat.\n| Whisk in the [[Gelatine|gelatine]] (if using) and the [[Butter|butter]].\n| Cover and leave to cool.\n}}\n====For the Cr\u00e8me Chantilly====\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Whisk all of the ingredients in a chilled bowl until it has thickened.\n| Do not over-whisk or you will end up with sweet [[Butter|butter]].\n| Cover the bowl and keep in the [[Fridge|fridge]] until needed.\n}}\n====To mix the two====\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Whisk the cold Cr\u00e8me P\u00e2tissi\u00e8re.\n| Whisk in one-third of the Cr\u00e8me Chantilly, until smooth.\n| Fold in the remaining [[Cream|cream]] with a [[Spatula|spatula]].\n| Store in an [[Airtight container|airtight container]] the [[Fridge|fridge]] until needed, although it is easier to work with if used immediately\n}}\n====Assembly====\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Fill the sponge cases with the Diplomat Cream \u2013 if you have made the unset version, just [[Pile|pile]] it in. For set version, you can use a [[Piping bag|piping bag]].\n| Arrange [[Cherries|cherries]] or [[Fruit|fruit]] of your choice on the [[Cream|cream]].\n| Sprinkle with a little [[Icing Sugar|icing sugar]].\n}}\n===Chef's notes===\nIt is likely that you will have some of the Diplomat Cream left over.  This can be [[Frozen|frozen]] and used in other recipes.\n\nIf using a fan [[Oven|oven]] which does not allow the fan to be switched off, do the following:\n\nOnce you have put the mixture into the moulds, wrap some [[Tin foil|tin foil]] around the [[Baking|baking]] in. The sponges need to be protected from the fan, but you don\u00c2\u2019t want the [[Foil|foil]] to touch them. I made a sort of tent over the top, which helped to keep it free of the mixture and if possible, enclose the whole [[Baking tin|baking tin]] with foil, so that the fan doesn\u00c2\u2019t dry up the sponges.\n\nPlace in a COLD [[Oven|oven]], below the middle, but not at the bottom.\n\nSwitch the [[Oven|oven]] on to 160C and [[Bake|bake]] for about 35 minutes (!).\n\nRemove the [[Foil|foil]] and check that they are cooked. If not they can go back in without the foil covering.\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:North American recipes]]\n[[Category:Bread and baking]]\n[[Category:Sweets and desserts]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes]]\n[[Category:Fruit recipes]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#butter #fridge #gelatine #icingsugar #boil #airtightcontainer #foil #cherries #castersugar #saucepan #cream </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
