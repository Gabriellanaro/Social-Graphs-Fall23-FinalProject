It needs to be cooked very slowly in some sort of liquid, otherwise it will become tough and dry. \n\nThis is a version of [[Slow cooked silverside of beef]] adapted for a [[pressure cooker]].\n\nWe would not normally buy a joint of this size for just two of us, but it seemed good value and will last for at least 3 days.\n\nThis was fabulous - thank you [[Julia]] for the inspiration!\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 2 kg (4 lb) joint of [[Beef|beef]] silverside\n| 2 tablespoons [[Oil|oil]]\n| Freshly [[ground black pepper]]\n| 4 medium [[Carrots|carrots]], peeled and sliced\n| 3 sticks of [[Celery|celery]], coarsely chopped\n| 10 [[Dried|dried]] [[shiitake mushrooms]]\n| 500ml hot [[Beef Stock|beef stock]]\n| 1 bottle of robust [[Red wine|red wine]]\n| 6 large cloves of [[Garlic|garlic]], peeled\n| 1 large [[Onion|onion]], sliced\n| 2 tablespoons [[Tomato|tomato]] puree\n| A squeeze of lemon juice\n| 3 tablespoons [[Worcestershire sauce]]\n| 1 [[Bouquet garni]] - made up from what was in the garden at the time: [[sage]], [[rosemary]], [[parsley]], [[cutting celery]], [[bay leaves]].\n\n}}\n\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n* Preheat the [[Slow cooker|slow cooker]] for a few minutes.\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Silverside of beef carved.jpg|Silverside of beef carved\nImage:Silverside of beef in a pressure cooker ready.jpg|Ready for 3 hours of cooking\nImage:Silverside of beef in a pressure cooker ingredients.jpg|The ingredients\n</gallery>\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Pat the joint dry and cover with a good grind of [[black pepper]]\n| Leaving the ''netting'' on the joint, heat the [[Oil|oil]] in a [[Frying pan|frying pan]] and [[Sear|sear]] the [[Meat|meat]] for about 3 minutes on each side.\n| Chop the dried mushrooms into quarters\n| Add the [[carrots]], [[onions]], [[garlic]], [[shiitake mushrooms|mushrooms]] to the [[pressure cooker]] and sit the seared meat on top, jiggle it around a little if you need more room.\n| Deglaze the meat pan with a little red wine and add that to the mix.\n| Pour over the remaining [[red wine]], [[beef stock]], [[Worcestershire sauce]] and [[tomato pur\u00e9e]] and mix well.\n| Fit the lid, bring up to pressure and cook on [[pressure cooker#Internal temperature related to pressure|high pressure]] for 3 hours.\n| [[De-pressurising a pressure cooker#Natural release|Depressurise naturally]]\n| Remove the silverside from the [[pressure cooker]] and allow to rest, under tented [[Foil|foil]] for 15 minutes.\n| Using a slotted spoon, ladle just more than half of the vegetables and a little stock into a [[food processor]] and blend to make a gravy.\n| Add the gravy back to the pan with the remaining vegetables, add a few tablespoons of [[yellow cornmeal]] if it needs thickening.  Bring back to the boil, uncovered, for a short while to thicken when ready to serve.\n| Slice the silverside, reheat the [[Gravy|gravy]] and serve.\n}}\n===Chef's notes===\nI don't profess to be a pressure cooker expert, so 3 hours may be rather a long time to cook this joint-however, it was melt-in-the-mouth tender and almost all of the gelatinous tissues had melted away.  The meat still had plenty of flavour.\n\nThis fabulous recipe has lasted us for 5 days!  We have had it with [[jacket potatoes]] & vegetables, filled [[Yorkshire puddings]] and [[vegetables]], with [[homemade pasta]], with [[couscous]] and tonight, turned into [[Mexican meatballs]] in a [[Bolognaise Sauce (PC)|bolognaise sauce]] with [[spaghetti]].\n\nThe trick was to separate the gravy and the cooked meat as soon as the meat was cooked.  Because they were separately stored and refrigerated in [[Lock and Lock]]-style boxes, the meat could be carved and server with or without the gravy.\n==See also==\n* [[Slow cooked silverside of beef]] - A [[slow cooker]] version of this recipe.\n* [[Talk:Slow cooked silverside of beef|Notes made after cooking this recipe in a slow cooker]]\n* [[Slow roast recipes]]\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes|Beef silverside]]\n[[Category:British recipes|Beef silverside]]\n[[Category:Main courses|Beef silverside]]\n[[Category:Beef recipes|Beef silverside]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes|Beef silverside]]\n[[Category:Cooking with wine|Beef silverside]]\n[[Category:Favourite recipes|Beef silverside]]\n[[Category:Pressure cooker recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#pressurecooker #worcestershiresauce #jacketpotatoes #garlic #shiitakemushrooms #beefstock #beef #redwine #slowcooker #carrots #roasting </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
