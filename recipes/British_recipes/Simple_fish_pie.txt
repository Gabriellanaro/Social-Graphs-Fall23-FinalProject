Stir in the [[Flour|flour]] to make a [[Roux|roux]]; season to taste with [[Sea Salt|sea salt]] (or Proven\u00e7al [[Herb|herb]] [[Salt|salt]]), [[Pepper|pepper]] and [[Turmeric|turmeric]].\n| Slowly add the [[Milk|milk]] in which the [[Fish|fish]] had been [[Poached|poached]], to make a reasonably thick [[Sauce|sauce]]. Heat gently, and keep stirring, until the [[Flour|flour]] 'explodes'.\n| Add the [[Fish|fish]] to the [[Sauce|sauce]], and fold it into an [[Oven|oven]]-proof dish. Peel the [[Hard-boiled eggs|hard-boiled eggs]] and slice, place slices evenly over the fish and sauce. [[Mash]] the [[Potato|potato]] after seasoning to taste, use a little extra [[Butter|butter]] and a splash of [[Milk|milk]].\n| Cover the [[Fish|fish]] in the dish with the [[Mashed potato|mashed potato]], spread the [[Grated|grated]] [[Cheese|cheese]] evenly overall.\n| Place the dish in the [[Oven|oven]] and [[Bake|bake]] for 30 minutes.\n}}\n===Variations===\nFor variety, a dash of [[garam masala]] in the mashed potato is a pleasant contrasting taste.\n\nAdd a chopped leek to the potatoes for the final 10 minutes of boiling for a little more flavour and texture.\n\nAdd a sprinkle of whole [[fennel seeds]] to the milk whilst the fish is cooking.\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Fish recipes]]\n[[Category:Potato recipes]]\n[[Category:Sea fish recipes]]\n[[Category:Cookery cheats]]\n[[Category:Student recipes]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#simplefishpie #fish #sauce #butter #flour #fishpie #haddock #turmeric #miseenplace #plainflour #poached </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
