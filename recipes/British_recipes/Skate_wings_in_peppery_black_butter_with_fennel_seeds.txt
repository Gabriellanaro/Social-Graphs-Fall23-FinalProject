Time to rectify that!\n[[Image:Skate wings two pans.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Use two frying pans if you can]]\nSkates, rays and sharks are all part of the Chondrichthyes family which have [[bones]] made from cartilage, almost soft and bendy, so no nasty 'stick in your throat' [[bones]].\n\nAs with most [[Fish|fish]] they don't need much cooking and because the [[Skate wings|skate wings]] are of a fairly thin and of an even thickness, they cook quickly - about 4 minutes a side.\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 2 [[Skate]] wings\n| 2 teaspoons [[Fennel seeds|fennel seeds]]\n| 1 teaspoon [[Black peppercorns|black peppercorns]]\n| 3 tablespoons of [[Plain flour|plain flour]]\n| 2 teaspoons of [[Butter|butter]]\n| 2 teaspoons [[Olive oil|olive oil]]\n| 10 [[New Potatoes|new potatoes]]\n| 1 cup of [[Frozen peas|frozen peas]]\n| 1 fresh [[Lemon|lemon]]\n}}\n\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| Pop the [[Fennel seeds|fennel seeds]] and the [[Peppercorns|peppercorns]] in a [[Pestle and mortar|pestle and mortar]] and smash them up.  Don't worry if you can't get the [[Fennel|fennel]] [[Seeds|seeds]] to a powder, the flaky bits are fine.\n| Shake the smashed [[Spices|spices]] onto a plate and coat either side of the [[Skate wings|skate wings]]\n| Repeat the same process with the [[Flour|flour]] so the wings are well covered.\n| Using two pans if you can, heat the pans to medium, when hot add a teaspoon of [[Butter|butter]] to each pan, the moment it starts to sizzle and colour, ad a splash of [[Olive oil|olive oil]] to each pan, mix well and slide the [[Skate wings|skate wings]] into the pan.\n| Cook for 4 minutes on each side.\n| Meanwhile [[Steam|steam]] the [[Potatoes|potatoes]] and [[Microwave|microwave]] the [[Peas|peas]].\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe with [[Wedges of lemon|wedges of lemon]] and [[Mayonnaise|mayonnaise]] - Yum!\n===Recipe source===\n\n* I got the inspiration to try this recipe from reading Jamie Oliver's 'Great Britain Recipe Book' one rainy Sunday afternoon.\n===Variations===\nI love the flavour of [[Masa Harina|masa harina]] so use whenever I can.  Even in this dish it imparts its character.  Us it if you can, or even [[Yellow cornmeal|yellow cornmeal]].\n===Chef's notes===\nYou could use an [[Egg wash|egg wash]] to assist the [[Flour|flour]] in sticking to the [[Fish|fish]].  Our [[Chickens|chickens]] are not laying at the moment so thankfully this recipe seems to work just as well without.\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Historic recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Fish recipes]]\n[[Category:Sea fish recipes]]\n[[Category:Pan fried]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#skatewings #skatewingsinpepperyblackbutterwithfennelseeds #fish #fennelseeds #oliveoil #butter #flour #bones #panfried #steam #newpotatoes </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
