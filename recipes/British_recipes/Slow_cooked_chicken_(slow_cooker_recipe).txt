In general, the lower the strength of the cider, sweeter it is.  My [[chicken]] was larger than 1.5kg so I had to add quite a bit extra [[cider]]. \n \nYou must make sure that there is sufficient liquid to cover the [[chicken]] and the [[vegetables]].\n\nDo not throw away the left over liquid.  Keep it and use to make [[stock]].\n==See also==\n* {{See also - Jointing a chicken}}\n* [[Roasting a chicken in a slow cooker|Roast a whole chicken in a slow cooker]]\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes|Chicken]]\n[[Category:British recipes|Chicken]]\n[[Category:Main courses|Chicken]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes|Chicken]]\n[[Category:Poultry recipes|Chicken]]\n[[Category:Slow cooker recipes|Chicken]]\n[[Category:Cooking with wine|Chicken]]\n[[Category:Slow cooked|Chicken]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#chicken #slowcooker #vegetables #cider #fry #carrots #gravy #stock #kale #onion #garlic </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
