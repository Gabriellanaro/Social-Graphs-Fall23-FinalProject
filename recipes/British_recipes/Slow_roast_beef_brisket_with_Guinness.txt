I thought that it would be nice to do some experimenting with this cut of meat as it is so good for [[slow-roasting]] because of its high collagen content.  Initially I was going to use [[Red wine|red wine]] until I spotted a can of [[Guinness]] in the cupboard!\n\nSilverside of [[Beef|beef]] would be an equally good cut to use for this recipe.\n\nOnce the [[Onions|onions]], [[Garlic|garlic]] and [[Beef|beef]] have been [[Browned|browned]], this recipe could be made in a [[Slow cooker|slow cooker]].\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 1 kg brisket of [[Beef|beef]], rolled and tied with [[butchers' string]]\n| 440 ml can of [[Guinness]] original\n| A few tablespoons of [[Olive oil|olive oil]]\n| 8 small [[Onions|onions]] or [[Shallots|shallots]], peeled and halved\n| 3 Cloves of [[Garlic|garlic]] or to taste, peeled and chopped\n| [[Freshly ground black pepper]]\n| 2 [[Carrots|carrots]], peeled and sliced\n| A handful of [[Dried|dried]] [[Porcini mushrooms|porcini mushrooms]], or any strongly flavoured [[Dried mushrooms|dried mushrooms]]. Even fresh [[Button mushrooms|button mushrooms]] would do at a push\n| 2 tablespoons [[Balsamic vinegar|balsamic vinegar]]\n| 2 tablespoons of your favourite acidic [[Vinegar|vinegar]].  [[Sherry vinegar]] would be my choice here\n| A stick of [[Celery|celery]] with leaves if possible.  I used some [[Cutting celery|cutting celery]] that was just about to go to [[Seed|seed]]\n| A small sprig of fresh [[Thyme|thyme]]\n| 2 small fresh [[Bay leaves|bay leaves]]\n| A sprig of [[Parsley|parsley]]\n| A small cube of [[Jaggery|jaggery]], scraped to powder or a level tablespoon of [[Brown sugar|brown sugar]]\n| 1 pint of hot [[Beef Stock|beef stock]]\n| [[Cornflour]] to thicken if required\n\n}}\n\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n* Preheat the [[Oven|oven]] to 150\u00b0 C (300\u00b0 F - gas 2)\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Locro simmering.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Seal the casserole lid with scrunched up [[tin foil]]\nImage:Pot roast beef brisket with Guinness ingredients.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Pot roast brisket with [[Guinness]], the ingredients\n</gallery>\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| I'm never keen on [[Vegetables|vegetables]] that have been slow cooked, so apart from the [[Mushrooms|mushrooms]] and the [[Beef|beef]], everything else will be discarded or used to make the [[Gravy|gravy]] once the cooking has been finished.  I leave the [[Herbs|herbs]] whole for easy removal.\n| Heat the [[Olive oil|olive oil]] in a large [[Casserole dish|casserole dish]], grind lots of fresh [[Peppercorns|pepper]] into the hot [[Oil|oil]] and then [[Brown|brown]] the [[Beef|beef]] on both sides.\n| Add the [[Onions|onions]] and [[Garlic|garlic]] and saut\u00e9 for 4 minutes.\n| Add the remaining ingredients and mix well.\n| Seal the [[Casserole dish|casserole dish]] with scrunched up [[Silver foil|silver foil]] and [[Pot roast|pot roast]] in the [[Oven|oven]] for about 5 hours.\n| Discard the [[Carrots|carrots]] and [[Herbs|herbs]].\n| Drain as much of the [[Stock|stock]] as you need to make the [[Gravy|gravy]], together with some of the [[Onions|onions]] and [[Garlic|garlic]].  Reduce a little if you wish and then thicken by stirring in a few teaspoons of [[Cornflour|cornflour]] or [[arrowroot]] that has been mixed with a little cold water, bring to a bubble and whisk until it is at your desired consistency.\n| You could liquidise some of the [[Carrots|carrots]] and [[Herbs|herbs]] too and add to the [[Gravy|gravy]] if you wish.\n| Slice very thickly and serve with the [[Mushrooms|mushrooms]] and [[Gravy|gravy]].\n}}\n===Variations===\nYou could omit the herbs and vegetables and just use a very strong [[vegetable stock]].\n===Serving suggestions===\n[[Peas]] or [[Broccoli|broccoli]] and [[Crispy jacket potatoes|crispy jacket potatoes]] would be my choice. \n{{RecipeLine}}\n* [[Slow roast recipes]]\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Irish recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Beef recipes]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:Slow cooker recipes]]\n[[Category:Stews and casseroles]]\n[[Category:Cooking with beer]]\n[[Category:Stewed, braised or pot roasted]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#beef #gravy #onions #garlic #carrots #herbs #guinness #mushrooms #cornflour #slowroastbeefbrisketwithguinness #casseroledish </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
