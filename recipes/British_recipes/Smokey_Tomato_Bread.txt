Don't worry about the dough sticking to your hands as it will become less moist as you work it.\n| Shape into a ball, place in an oiled bowl and cover with [[Clingfilm|clingfilm]].\n| Leave until the [[Dough|dough]] has almost doubled in size (about an hour).\n| Gently [[Knock back|knock back]] with your finger tips and repeat steps 6 and 7, but the [[Proving|proving]] should only take about 45 minutes.\n| Gently [[Knock back|knock back]] again, face downards into a rectangle, one side being the same length as the tin.\n| Roll the [[Dough|dough]] towards you as tightly as you can.\n| Flatten and stretch the ends and tuck them underneath so that they meet up in the middle.\n| Place into a 900g / 2lb loaf tin, cover with [[Clingfilm|clingfilm]] and prove until the [[Dough|dough]] reaches the top of the tin.\n| Make some diagonal slashes across the top or one long one across the lenghth and [[Bake|bake]] at 220\u00b0 C (425\u00b0 F - gas 7), [fan [[Oven|oven]] 200\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour] for 30-35 minutes until [[Baked|baked]].\n| Cool completely on a wire rack.\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nGood with [[Cheese|cheese]].\n===Variations===\nVary the [[Herbs|herbs]] or you could use a sweet [[Smoked paprika|smoked paprika]] - [[Piment\u00f3n de la Vera]] (dulce).\n===Chef's notes===\nThe loaf looks burnt but isn't.  It is just where the [[onion]] powder has caramelised.  The same would also happen if you used [[Garlic|garlic]] powder.  I have a friend who goes to Barbados regularly who brings back [[onion]] powder for me as I have never seen it in our part of the UK.  I would suggest you try a good Asian or Caribbean grocer's shop.\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Bread and baking]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegan recipes]][[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#dough #onion #yeast #smokeytomatobread #clingfilm #smokedpaprika #flour #oliveoil #knockback #tomatojuice #driedoregano </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
