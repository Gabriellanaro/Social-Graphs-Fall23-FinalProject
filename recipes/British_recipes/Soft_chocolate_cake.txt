Be patient!\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 140 g Fresh, dark [[Cherries|cherries]], pitted. (or use a tin or [[Frozen|frozen]])\n| 4 tablespoons [[Kirsch|kirsch]] de cuisine\n| 100g [[Butter|butter]], plus extra for the tin\n| 2 tablespoons [[Cocoa|cocoa]] (drinking [[Chocolate|chocolate]] won\u2019t do.)\n| 140 gm dark [[Chocolate|chocolate]] (70%) chopped\n| 100 gm [[Caster sugar|caster sugar]] (prefer golden myself..but it doesn\u2019t have to be)\n| 50g light [[Muscovado sugar]]\n| 4 large [[Eggs|eggs]], 2 separated\n| 1 teaspoon [[Vanilla extract|vanilla extract]]\n| 100 gm [[Ground almonds|ground almonds]] \n| 1 tablespoon [[Plain flour|plain flour]] ([[Gluten]] free works well)\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Gently heat the [[Cherries|cherries]] and [[Kirsch|kirsch]] in a small pan over a low heat until hot. Turn off the heat; cover the pan with lid or a saucer. Allow to cool. The [[Cherries|cherries]] will absorb the liquid. Stir occasionally. [[Mash]] a little or whiz with [[Stick blender|stick blender]], you don't want it to be too smooth.\n| [[Butter]] and base line only a 20cm springform tin. Dust with [[Cocoa|cocoa]], tip out any excess and reserve. Melt the [[Butter|butter]] and [[Chocolate|chocolate]] in a heatproof bowl set over a pan of barely [[Simmering|simmering]] water. Don't let the water touch the bottom of the bowl. When fully melted and smooth..allow to cool a little\u2026then stir in the [[Cherries|cherries]].\n| Whisk the [[Sugars|sugars]] and 2 whole [[Eggs|eggs]] and 2 [[Yolks|yolks]] until pale, thick and double in volume. Stick blenders are so good. Fold the [[Chocolate|chocolate]] mixture and the [[Vanilla|vanilla]] into the [[Egg|egg]]. Sift over the [[Almonds|almonds]], [[Flour|flour]] and any remaining [[Cocoa|cocoa]]\u2026fold well. \n| In a clean bowl, whisk the [[Egg whites|egg whites]] until stiff. Spoon 2 tablespoons of [[Egg white|egg white]]s into the main bowl to loosen. Then the remaining [[Egg|egg]] white. Work quickly and well until everything is well combined.\n| Spoon into the prepared tin and [[Bake|bake]] for 20-25 minutes or until a light crust has formed. \n| Allow to cool in the tin. It will sink and crack as it cools. Remove from the tin and dust with a little [[Cocoa|cocoa]] before serving.\n}}\n===Recipe source===\n* Recipe adapted from BBC Good Food.
