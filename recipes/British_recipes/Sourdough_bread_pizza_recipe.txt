Though it sounds odd, the slices of [[Lemon|lemon]] tempered the fatty [[Meat|meat]] and the [[Cheese|cheese]].\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| 6 thick slices of white [[Sourdough bread|sourdough bread]] - crusts left on\n| 2 balls of [[Mozzarella cheese|mozzarella cheese]], drained and torn into pieces\n| 150g sliced [[Meat|meat]] such as [[Salami|salami]]\n| 4 very thick slices of [[Lemon|lemon]], skin on but pips removed\n| 1 [[Red pepper|red pepper]] from a bottle of jarred [[Roasted red peppers|roasted red peppers]], chopped into small pieces\n| Lots of freshly torn [[Basil leaves|basil leaves]] - almost &#190; of the plant pictures went into the 2 [[Pizzas|pizzas]]\n| [[Freshly ground black pepper]]\n| Lots of [[Extra virgin Olive oil|extra virgin olive oil]]\n}}\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n\n* Preheat your [[Oven|oven]] to 200\u00b0 C (400\u00b0 F - gas 6), [fan oven 180\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Sourdough bread pizza ready to bake.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Assembled, ready to bake\nImage:Sourdough bread pizza recipe ingredients.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The ingredients, the nectarine was unused in the end.\n</gallery>\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| Lightly [[Oil|oil]] the base of the [[Pie|pie]] / flan dishes\n| Place 3 slices of [[Sourdough bread|sourdough bread]] in each tin\n| Drizzle with [[Olive oil|olive oil]] and sprinkle with [[Black pepper|black pepper]]\n| Layer the sliced [[Meat|meat]], chopped [[Red pepper|red pepper]] and torn [[Mozzarella|mozzarella]] to fill the tin, finding places to bury the [[Lemon slices|lemon slices]]\n| Drizzle with [[Olive oil|olive oil]]\n| [[Bake]] for 15 minutes in the middle of the [[Oven|oven]] set to 200\u00b0 C (400\u00b0 F - gas 6)\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe with a [[Green salad|green salad]]\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Italian recipes]]\n[[Category:Bread and baking]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Cheese recipes]]\n[[Category:Fruit recipes]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:Cookery cheats]]\n[[Category:Pizza recipes]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#sourdoughbreadpizzarecipe #pizza #salami #redpepper #cheese #lemon #sourdoughbread #oliveoil #bread #sourdough #bake </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
