It also keeps it nice and moist.\n\nIf you are '''not''' going to cook the [[Meat|meat]] [[Sous-vide|sous-vide]], leave the steaks covered in the rub for at least a few hours at room temperature before cooking.\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| 2 x 225g Aldi 21 day matured [[Rib-eye steaks]] from Ashfield Farms\n| 2 tablespoons [[Taste Sensation]] Philly Cheesesteak seasoning\n}}\n\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| Shake about 3 tablespoons of the [[Taste Sensation]] Philly Cheesesteak seasoning evenly on to a dinner plate\n| Press the steaks onto the rub and ensure they are evenly and well coated\n| Add both of the [[Rib|rib]]-eye steaks to one [[Sous-vide|sous-vide]] [[Vacuum bag|vacuum bag]]\n| [[Vacuum seal]] and cook in the [[Sous-vide bath|sous-vide bath]] at 68\u00b0C for 4 hours\n| Remove the bag and serve immediately\n}}\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Vacuum sealed Philly rib-eye Cheesesteak.jpg\nImage:Taste Sensation Philly Cheesesteak being seasoned.jpg\nImage:Taste Sensation Philly Cheesesteak seasoning plated.jpg\nImage:Taste Sensation Philly Cheesesteak seasoning bag details.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe with [[Chips|chips]], and [[Vegetables|vegetables]] of your choice.\n\n===Chef's notes===\nI originally cooked the steaks at 64\u00b0C for 3 hours; they were very nice but not done well enough for the interconnecting tissues to break down so I have increased the temperature and cooking time slightly.\nNice seasoning mix. \n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:North American recipes]]\n[[Category:Historic recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Spicy recipes]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:Sous vide recipes]]\n[[Category:Taste Sensation recipes]]\n[[Category:Sous vide cooking]]\n[[Category:Recipes from other sites]]\n{{Template:Sous Vide, Smoking and Curing UK}}\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:12032020'>#tastesensation #spicyrecipes #phillycheesesteak #tastesensationltd #tastesensationphillycheesesteakseasoning #spices #sousvidecooking #tastesensationrecipes #meatrecipes #sousvide</code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
