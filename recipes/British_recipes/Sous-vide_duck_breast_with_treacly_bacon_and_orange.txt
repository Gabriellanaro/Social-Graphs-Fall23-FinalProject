They also produce fabulous [[Duck|duck]] breasts.  I thought a combination of the two, with the addition of a few extra flavours might be nice.\n\nThe results were fantastic, despite the long cooking time and the relatively high cooking temperature the duck was soft and tender and full of flavour.\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| 1 large [[Duck|duck]] breast, skin on\n| 1 thick slice of [[Treacle Cured Bacon from Russell's of Upwell's|Treacle Cured Back Bacon]]\n| 4 whole [[Star anise|star anise]]\n| 5 [[Szechuan peppercorns|szechuan peppercorns]], crushed\n| 5 [[Black peppercorns|black peppercorns]], crushed\n| &#189; a large [[Orange|orange]], cut into thick slicers, skin left on\n}}\n\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| Roll the [[Duck|duck]] breast in the mixture of [[Ground|ground]] [[Peppercorns|peppercorns]]\n| Place the [[Bacon|bacon]] on the fleshy side of the [[Duck|duck]] breast\n| Cover the [[Bacon|bacon]] with the [[Orange|orange]] slices\n| Place in a sous-vice [[Vacuum bag|vacuum bag]]\n| Scatter the [[Star anise|star anise]] over the [[Oranges|oranges]]\n| Vacuum seal and cook in a [[Sous-vide bath|sous-vide bath]] for 10 hours at 82\u00b0C (179.6\u00b0F)\n| Drain the fat and discard the star-anise\n| If you wish you can crisp up the skin (and the bacon) by searing in a hot pan, skin-side down in a hot pan for 4 minutes\n| Slice thinly before serving\n}}\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage: Sous-vide duck breast shredded and chopped.jpg|Duck breast chopped and shredded ready to serve\nImage:Sous-vide duck breast pan seared with treacly bacon and orange.jpg|Bacon and duck seared in the pan to crisp the skin\nImage:Treacly bacon and orange duck breast searing in the pan.jpg|Make sure the bacon is crispy too\nImage:Vacuum sealed duck breast with treacly bacon orange and star-anise.jpg|Vacuum sealed ready for bath-time!\nImage:Russell's Treacly Bacon Slices.jpg|[[Treacle Cured Bacon from Russell's of Upwell's]]\n</gallery>\n===Serving suggestion===\nServe with [[curly fries]] and a selection of vegetables\n===Variations===\nIf you can't get hold of [[treacly bacon]], use thick fatty back bacon and a teaspoon of [[Black treacle|black treacle]]\n===Chef's notes===\nI would normally advise cooking a [[Sous-vide|sous-vide]] [[Duck|duck]] breast for only 4 hours at a much lower temperature so the result is medium-rare, however to distribute the [[Duck fat|duck fat]] within th emeat and to spread the flavours, my experiments have show a higher temperature for longer, produces much nicer results.\n===See also===\n* [[Russell's Butchers of Upwell, Norfolk]]\n* [[Treacle Cured Bacon from Russell's of Upwell's]]\n\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Fruit recipes]]\n[[Category:Game recipes]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:Pork recipes]]\n[[Category:Poultry recipes]]\n[[Category:Sous vide recipes]]\n[[Category:Sous vide cooking]]\n{{Template:Sous Vide, Smoking and Curing UK}}\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:12032020'>#duck #bacon #staranise #orange #sousvideduckbreastwithtreaclybaconandorange #treacle #recipes #blacktreacle #peppercorns #sousviderecipes #vacuumbag</code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
