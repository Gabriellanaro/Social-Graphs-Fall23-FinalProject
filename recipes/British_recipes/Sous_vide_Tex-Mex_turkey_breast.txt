Any similar [[Spice|spice]] mix would do, don't add any extra [[Salt|salt]] if you do use Old [[India]] [[Taco seasoning|taco seasoning]] as it's very salty already.  This would be equally good with just salt and [[Black pepper|black pepper]].  The temperature of 67\u00b0C (''152.6\u00b0F'') been chosen for a moist joint and a cooking time of 10 hours seems to [[Tenderise|tenderise]] the [[Meat|meat]] really nicely and is also a convenient period of time for anyone out at work all day.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| 1.2 kg boneless [[Turkey|turkey]] breast joint\n| 2 tablespoons [[Old India Taco Seasoning]]\n}}\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Sous vide Tex-Mex turkey breast sealed.jpg|Vacuum sealed and ready for the sous vide bath\nImage:Sous vide Tex-Mex turkey breast taco mix.jpg|Turkey breast rolled in the taco mix\nImage:Sous vide Tex-Mex turkey breast ingredients.jpg|The basic ingredients\nImage:Nacho cheese sous-vide turkey crown.jpg|Aldi 'medium' turkey crown - Nacho cheese powder, sage and onion\n</gallery>\n===[[Mise en place]]===\nPreheat your [[sous-vide bath]] to 67\u00b0C.\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| Remove all the packaging from the [[Turkey|turkey]] breast, including the net bag as the vacuum packing will hold the joint together while it cooks.\n| Add 2 tablespoons of [[Old India Taco Seasoning]] to a plate and roll the breast around in it to coat evenly.\n| Measure out a vacuum bag bigger than you probably need, it makes for much easier sealing I find.\n| Seal one end, twice for good measure!\n| Pop the [[Turkey|turkey]] breast in the bag and [[Vacuum seal|vacuum seal]].\n| Cook in a [[Sous vide|sous vide]] bath for 10 hours at 67\u00b0C.\n| If you wish you can finish the joint by [[Browning|browning]] in a hot pan with a little [[Butter|butter]] or [[Olive oil|olive oil]], if you have a [[Blowtorch|blowtorch]] you can use that while sealing in the pan.  It saves setting fire to the worktop!\n| Carve and serve immediately.\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nWe'll have the hot slices with all of the [[Roast|roast]] trimmings, the rest will go well in [[Salads|salads]] for the next few days.\n{{SousVideSeeAlso}}\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:Poultry recipes]]\n[[Category:Sous vide recipes]]\n[[Category:Sous vide cooking]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#turkey #sousvidetexmexturkeybreast #sousvide #vacuumseal #tenderise #blackpepper #tacoseasoning #roast #sousvidecooking #blowtorch #butter </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
