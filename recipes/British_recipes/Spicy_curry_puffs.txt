I've divided up the cooked filling, [[vacuum sealed]] in '2 puff' portions and [[Frozen|frozen]] them.  I slow cooked the filling but it would be nearly as good if it was just [[Simmered|simmered]] for an hour.\n[[Image:Spicy curry puffs on the pizza stone.jpg|thumb|300px|right|baked on the [[pizza stone]]]]\n\nYou could probably use less [[Puff pastry|puff pastry]], but as it's so nice why not use more of it!\n\nYou could use a few [[Chillies|chillies]] or your favourite [[Curry|curry]] [[Sauce|sauce]] or paste as an alternative to my choice of [[Cock Brand curry paste]].\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| 500 g [[Minced beef|minced beef]]\n| 1 tablespoon [[Ghee|ghee]] or [[Vegetable oil|vegetable oil]]\n| 3 [[Cloves garlic, peeled and crushed|cloves garlic, peeled and crushed]]\n| Good pinch of [[Freshly ground black pepper|freshly ground black pepper]]\n| 1 [[Onion|onion]], peeled and finely chopped\n| 1 [[Leek|leek]], sliced\n| 1 tablespoon [[Cock Brand curry paste]]\n| 1 large [[Carrot|carrot]], peeled, quartered lengthwise and sliced\n| 1 mug of [[Frozen peas|frozen peas]]\n| 1 [[Oxo cube]], crumbled\n| A little water\n}}\n'''for the puffs'''\n{{RecipeIngredientsNB\n| 1 pack of [[Pre-rolled puff pastry|pre-rolled puff pastry]]\n}}\n\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| Add all of the ingredients to the [[Slow cooker|slow cooker]] and stir well.\n| Add a little water to loosen the mixture. Not too much as you don't want it to be too wet inside the [[Puff pastry|puff pastry]].  Start off with about 50 ml and check after an hour.\n| Slow cook on low for up to 7 hours.\n| You could use this immediately.  I batched mine up into 300g [[Servings|servings]] (enough for 2 large puffs), vacuum sealed and froze them.\n| When you are ready to [[Bake|bake]] the puffs, remove the [[Puff pastry|puff pastry]] from the [[Fridge|fridge]] for 1 hour before you need to use it and preheat the [[Oven|oven]] to 220\u00b0 C (425\u00b0 F - gas 7), [fan oven 200\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]\n| One standard pack of [[Puff pastry|puff pastry]] makes 2 large puffs as shown in the photos.\n| Add the filling to the middle of the bottom half of the [[Puff pastry|puff pastry]] and fold the top over to seal. I found that folding the edge over before crimping with the tines of a fork prevented the filling from leaking out, a potentially disastrous event!\n| [[Bake]] for 25 minutes in the middle of the [[Oven|oven]], but check after 20 minutes as they burn easily at this temperature.\n| I [[Baked|baked]] mine on a preheated [[Pizza stone|pizza stone]] so the base was as crunchy as the top.\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe with [[Potatoes|potatoes]] and [[Vegetables|vegetables]] and a little gravy.\n===Variations===\nYou could of course make much smaller [[Curry|curry]] puffs than are shown here.  They would make great [[Tapa|tapa]].\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Snacks and light bites]]\n[[Category:Spicy recipes]]\n[[Category:Tapas, mezze and antipasti]]\n[[Category:Beef recipes]]\n[[Category:Chilli pepper recipes]]\n[[Category:Garlic recipes]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n[[Category:Slow cooked]]\n[[Category:Favourite recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#puffpastry #curry #spicycurrypuffs #bake #pizzastone #sauce #slowcooker #servings #mincedbeef #ghee #potatoes </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
