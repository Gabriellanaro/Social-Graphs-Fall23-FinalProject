Why not make double the amount and freeze half for another pie at a later date?\n| Add the [[Flour|flour]] to a bowl and season with [[Salt|salt]] and '''lots''' of [[Black pepper|black pepper]] and [[mustard powder]].\n| Roll the [[Meat|meat]] in the [[Flour|flour]] to coat well\n| You can do the [[Frying|frying]] stage in an oven proof pan, a [[Le Creuset]] type dish or a [[Wok|wok]].\n| Add a glug of [[Olive oil|olive oil]] to the [[Wok|wok]] and saut\u00e9 the [[Onions|onions]] and [[Garlic|garlic]] over a low heat until translucent, about 7 minutes, remove and reserve\n| Turn up the heat and add a little more [[Olive oil|olive oil]] if necessary, [[Brown|brown]] the [[Beef|beef]] cubes for 3 or 4 minutes then add the [[Onions|onions]] back and tip in the [[Butter|butter]], [[Carrots|carrots]], [[Celery|celery]], [[parsley]], [[Rosemary|rosemary]] and [[mushrooms]] and [[Fry|fry]] off for a few more minutes \n| [[Deglaze]] the pan with a splash of [[brandy]] if you have some laying around.\n| Tip everything into an oven proof dish if you are using your [[Wok|wok]] and pour in the [[Guinness]] and enough water so the contents are just covered, stir, cover and cook in the oven for about 2.5 hours.  Give it a stir halfway through.\n| If after this cooking it's still very runny, reduce it further by heating on the hob.\n| Mix in half of the [[Cheese|cheese]], taste and adjust the seasoning if required.\n}}\n'''Baking the pie'''\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Grease a [[Pie dish|pie dish]] with [[Olive oil|olive oil]] and tip in the filling\n| Sprinkle over the with the remaining [[Cheddar cheese]]\n| With a sharp knife, have some fun scoring a pattern in the top, and then [[Brush|brush]] with the beaten [[Egg|egg]]\n| Lay the crust over the dish, allowing plenty of it to hang over the side as it will shrink.  Notice the difference in the photos\n| If the filling is hot then the pie will only need baking to rise the crust, whereas if it is cold, it will need longer to heat the filling\n| I would bake for 20 to 30 minutes to rise the crust alone, but check it's progress regularly\n| If you need to heat the contents as well bake for 30 to 40 minutes, but I would cover the pastry with [[tin-foil]] once it is golden-brown or it will burn.\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe hot with [[Garden peas|garden peas]], [[Boiled potatoes|boiled potatoes]] and a pint of [[Guinness]]!\n===Variations===\nMake smaller, individual pies.\n\nTo make a conventional [[steak and ale pie]], substitute [[bitter]] for the [[Guinness]].\n===Chef's tip===\nI have just lidded the pie with puff pastry but you can line the pie with [[Puff pastry|puff pastry]] as well, however, I find it just goes soggy.  You will probably need a 500g block if you are doing this. 2/3rds for the lining and 1/3 for the lid\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Cooking with beer]]\n[[Category:Beef recipes]]\n[[Category:Cheese recipes]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:Pies tarts and flans]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Irish recipes]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#guinness #oliveoil #onions #garlic #wok #steakguinnessandcheddarpuffpastrypie #miseenplace #flour #brandy #carrots #butter </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
