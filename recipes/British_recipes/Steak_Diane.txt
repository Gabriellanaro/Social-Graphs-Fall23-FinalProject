The highpoint of the meal came when a waiter in jacket and bow-tie flamed a diner's [[sirloin]] table-side before his very eyes! There are a number of variations on Steak Diane, but most call for [[butter]], [[shallots]], [[mustard]], [[cream]], [[Worcestershire sauce]], [[brandy]], and a match.\n\nThe dish is said to be named for Diane, the Roman Goddess of hunting; many game dishes also use her name.\n\nThis classic 70's dinner party dish is definitely still worth making because it has the very best ingredients.  Probably needs a bottle of Blue Nun and a [[prawn cocktail]] too!\n\n\n'''Sauce'''\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 1 large [[onion]], peeled and [[diced]] finely\n| 1 large [[carrot]], peeled and [[diced]] finely\n| 50 g (2 oz) [[butter]]\n| 15 g (1/2 oz) [[plain flour]]\n| &#190; pint of [[beef]] [[stock]] - (Mine was 2/3rds good beef stock & 1/3 red wine)\n| 1 [[bay leaf]]\n| Big handful of [[parsley]], stalks 'n all\n| Sprig of [[thyme]]\n| 1 tablespoon [[tomato puree]]\n| &#189; teaspoon [[mustard powder]]\n| &#189; teaspoon [[salt]] (omit if you are being lazy and using [[stock]] from a cube!)\n| [[Freshly ground black pepper]]\n}}\n'''Steaks'''\n{{RecipeIngredientsNB\n| 25 g (1 oz) [[butter]]\n| 4 fillet steaks\n| 2 tablespoons [[brandy]]\n| 1 tablespoon [[dry sherry]]\n| 1 tablespoon [[Worcestershire sauce]]\n| Chopped [[parsley]] to garnish\n}}\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Flaming Steak Diane.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Flaming Steak Diane\nImage:Steak Diane ingredients.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Steak Diane - the ingredients\n</gallery>\n===Method===\n\n'''Sauce'''\n{{RecipeMethod\n| In a saucepan, [[fry]] the [[onion]] and [[carrot]] in [[butter]] until golden\n| Add the [[flour]] and stir to absorb any remaining [[butter]]\n| Add the remaining [[sauce]] ingredients, bring to the [[boil]] and then [[simmer]] gently for 30 minutes, aiming to reduce by about half\n| Strain the liquid through a colander so you keep some of the ''bits''\n| Cover and set-aside for later\n}}\n'''Steaks'''\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Heat the [[butter]] and [[fry]] the steaks until [[browned]] all over\n| Pour the [[sherry]] and [[brandy]] over the steaks and light the vapours.
