Although this recipe takes 5 hours to cook, or burn, if you are forgetful, most of the time is in the [[Boiling|boiling]], the preparation is minimal, plus you have the benefit of the wonderful smell whilst it's cooking.\n\nThe pudding is known colloquially as \"Babby's Yead\" (Baby's Head) in certain areas of North West England.\n\n'''[[Steak and kidney pudding (PC)|The pressure cooker version of this recipe can be found here.]]'''\n\n''' Suet crust'''\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 350 g( 12 oz) [[Self-raising flour|self-raising flour]]\n| 175 g (6 oz) [[Shredded|shredded]] [[beef suet]] ([[Atora]])\n| Pinch of [[Sea Salt|sea salt]] and [[Freshly ground black pepper|freshly ground black pepper]]\n}}\n'''Filling'''\n{{RecipeIngredientsNB\n| 560 g (1&frac14; lb) [[chuck steak]] / [[braising steak]]\n| 275 g (10 oz) ox [[Kidney|kidney]] - trimmed to 225 g (8 oz), ''some supermarkets sell the above, ready trimmed, in one packet''\n| 2 tablespoons [[Plain flour|plain flour]]\n| Big pinch of [[Mustard powder|mustard powder]]\n| [[Sea Salt|sea salt]] and [[Freshly ground black pepper|freshly ground black pepper]] \n| Handful of fresh [[Parsley|parsley]], chopped\n| 1 teaspoon [[Worcestershire sauce]]\n| 1 Oxo cube, crumbled\n| 1 medium [[Onion|onion]], peeled and sliced\n| ''You shouldn't need to add any water though you may want to make some gravy separately to serve with the pudding''. \n}}\n===Method===\n\n'''Pastry'''\n{{RecipeMethod\n| You can do this in a [[Food processor|food processor]], but don't over-mix it\n| Sift the [[Flour|flour]], [[Salt|salt]] into a large mixing bowl\n| Season with [[Black pepper|black pepper]]\n| Add the [[Suet|suet]], a few drops of water and combine with the [[Flour|flour]], using a palette knife\n| Continue stirring, adding a few drops of water at a time until it starts to become a little clay-like\n| Stop adding water now and mix with your hands\n| Keep mixing until you have a smooth elastic [[Dough|dough]].  You can always make small adjustments by adding a little more [[Flour|flour]] or water as needed\n| Divide the [[Dough|dough]] into &frac14; for the lid and &frac34; t line the bowl\n| Roll out a circle, quite thick, about a foot in diameter and press into your pie-bowl\n| Roll the remainder out as a lid so that it sits over the edges of the lined bowl\n}}\n'''Filling'''\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Trim the [[Meat|meat]] and [[Kidneys|kidneys]] of excess [[Fat|fat]] etc. so you have the correct weight. Feed your cats or dogs with the remainder!\n| Season the [[Flour|flour]] with [[Salt|salt]], [[Pepper|pepper]] and [[Mustard|mustard]]\n| Dredge the [[Meat|meat]] and [[Kidney|kidney]] in the seasoned [[Flour|flour]]\n| Add all of the filling ingredients to a separate bowl.  Crumble in the [[Oxo cube]].  Mix well with your hands.\n| Fill the suet-lined bowl with the filling ingredients.\n| Shake any remaining [[Flour|flour]] over the top and ''just'' cover the [[Meat|meat]] with cold water\n| Add a few shakes of [[Worcestershire sauce]]\n| Season with [[Salt|salt]] and [[Pepper|pepper]]\n}}\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Steak and kidney pudding cooked.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Cooked & serving\nImage:Steak and kidney pudding prepared.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Ready for the lid\n</gallery>\n'''Wrapping and cooking'''\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Cover with a double layer of [[tin-foil]], leaving a pleat for expansion\n| Tie with [[kitchen string]] and make a handle affair if you are able.  It assists with removal later\n| Fill a lidded pan &frac34; full with [[Boiling|boiling]] water and lower the bowl into it, cover and [[Boil|boil]] for 5 hours. Yes that's five hours!\n| '''Set a timer for every hour''' so you can check that it's not boiled dry and top up if needed\n| If using a [[pressure cooker]], reduce the cooking time to about 2 hours, see full details in a [[Steak and kidney pudding (PC)|separate recipe, here]].\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe with [[mashed potatoes]] and [[peas]] and [[gravy]].\n\nDon't try and invert a pudding of this size onto a plate. You are inviting disaster, and for no sensible reason. Trust me. Serve it directly out of the bowl!\n\n===Chef's notes===\n* Don't sit the bowl on a saucer in the pan.  It will probably be broken after 5 hours\n* Next time, using this quantity, I would make 2 separate puddings\n* Check the ''use-by'' [[Date|date]] of the [[Suet|suet]], I had a batch of suet-pudding failures, which I eventually traced to years out-of-date packet [[suet]]. It does go off.\n* Suet can be frozen and keeps for ever this way.  Defrost naturally. \n\n===Variations===\nI often make 2 separate puddings using this recipe. I make the first using half the cooked meat and freeze the remainder for the other pudding.\nAlways make the suet mix on the day you plan to cook the pudding. I use 200 g of [[plain flour]] and 100 g of [[suet]] for each of the smaller puddings.\n\nOther variations can be found on the [[Talk:Steak and kidney pudding|comments]] page.\n====The best knot to tie kitchen twine single-handedly====\nAfter much experimenting, I have discovered the best knot to tie kitchen twine on your own is the ''[[Surgeons' knot]]''.\n==See also==\n* [[Steak and kidney pudding (PC)|A steak and kidney pudding recipe especially for a pressure cooker]]\n* [[Slow roast recipes]]\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Beef recipes]]\n[[Category:Offal recipes]]\n[[Category:Historic recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Steamed]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#steakandkidneypudding #flour #suet #worcestershiresauce #boiling #plainflour #kidney #dough #kidneys #peas #mustard </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
