You can always make small adjustments by adding a little more [[Flour|flour]] or water as needed\n| Divide the [[Dough|dough]] into &frac14; for the lid and &frac34; t line the bowl\n| Roll out a circle, quite thick, about a foot in diameter and press into your pie-bowl\n| Roll the remainder out as a lid so that it sits over the edges of the lined bowl\n}}\n'''Filling'''\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Trim the [[Meat|meat]] and [[Kidneys|kidneys]] of excess [[Fat|fat]] etc. so you have the correct weight. Feed your cats or dogs with the remainder!\n| Season the [[Flour|flour]] with [[Salt|salt]], [[Pepper|pepper]] and [[Mustard|mustard]]\n| Dredge the [[Meat|meat]] and [[Kidney|kidney]] in the seasoned [[Flour|flour]]\n| Add all of the filling ingredients to a separate bowl.  Crumble in the [[Oxo cube]].  Mix well with your hands.\n| Fill the suet-lined bowl with the filling ingredients.\n| Shake any remaining [[Flour|flour]] over the top and ''just'' cover the [[Meat|meat]] with cold water\n}}\n'''Wrapping and cooking'''\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Cover with a double layer of [[tin-foil]], leaving a pleat for expansion\n| Tie with [[kitchen string]].\n| Quarter fill the [[pressure cooker]] with boiling water.\n| Place the bowl in the shallow trivet.\n| Cook on high pressure for 2 hours.\n| Allow the pressure to come down naturally.\n}}\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Steak and kidney pudding cooked.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Cooked and ready to serve\nImage:Steak and kidney pudding prepared.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Ready for the lid\n</gallery>\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe with [[mashed potatoes]] and [[peas]] and [[gravy]].\n\nDon't try and invert a pudding of this size onto a plate. You are inviting disaster, and for no sensible reason. Trust me. Serve it directly out of the bowl!\n\n===Chef's notes===\n* Don't sit the bowl on a saucer in the pan.  It will probably be broken after 5 hours\n* Next time, using this quantity, I would make 2 separate puddings\n* Check the ''use-by'' [[Date|date]] of the [[Suet|suet]], I had a batch of suet-pudding failures, which I eventually traced to years out-of-date packet [[suet]]. It does go off. \n* Suet can be frozen and keeps for ever this way.  Defrost naturally.\n\n===Variations===\nI often make 2 separate puddings using this recipe. I make the first using half the cooked meat and freeze the remainder for the other pudding.\nAlways make the suet mix on the day you plan to cook the pudding. I use 200 g of [[plain flour]] and 100 g of [[suet]] for each of the smaller puddings.\n\nOther variations can be found on the [[Talk:Steak and kidney pudding|comments]] page.\n\nThis recipe was tested in a WMF 6.5 litre pressure cooker.   On this model high pressure is represented by two red rings showing (117&deg;C)\n====The best knot to tie kitchen twine single-handedly====\nAfter much experimenting, I have discovered the best knot to tie kitchen twine on your own is the ''[[Surgeons' knot]]''.\n==See also==\n* [[Pressure cooker recipes]]\n* [[Steak and kidney pudding]] - recipe and timings for the non-pressure cooker version.\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Beef recipes]]\n[[Category:Offal recipes]]\n[[Category:Historic recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Pressure cooker recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#flour #suet #kidney #dough #pressurecooker #pressurecookerrecipes #blackpepper #plainflour #mashedpotatoes #chucksteak #mushroomketchup </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
