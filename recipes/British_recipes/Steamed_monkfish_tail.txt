It is now widely available at a reasonable price.  If it has been filleted and deboned it can be used exactly like [[Prawns|prawns]], however it is often sold  sold on the bone as [[monkfish]] tail.  Removing the [[Meat|meat]] from the bone while the fish is raw can be tricky and wasteful. However, once cooked the meat just falls off.\n\nThe method below worked very well with a [[Frozen|frozen]] [[Monkfish|monkfish]] tail, the [[Dill|dill]] gave it a really nice [[Herbs|herbs]] flavour.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| 1 [[Monkfish|monkfish]] tail - [[Frozen|frozen]] is fine\n| 1 bunch of [[Dill|dill]]\n| Pinch of [[Sea Salt|sea salt]]\n}}\n\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| Make a bed of the [[Dill|dill]] in the [[Steamer|steamer]] basket\n| Sit the [[Monkfish|monkfish]] tail on the [[Dill|dill]], sprinkle with [[Sea Salt|sea salt]] and drop a few sprigs of dill over the top\n| Add [[Boiling|boiling]] water to the [[Steamer|steamer]] and [[Steam|steam]], covered for 15 minutes\n| I cooked mine from [[Frozen|frozen]] so after 15 minutes of [[Steaming|steaming]] I took the pan off the heat and let it sit for 10 minutes.\n| Once cooled a little the flesh just falls off the gelatinous bone.\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nI used the monkfish meat in [[Cheesy monkfish jacket potatoes]] - plenty for two people.\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Fish recipes]]\n[[Category:Sea fish recipes]]\n[[Category:Steamed]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#monkfish #dill #frozen #steamer #steamedmonkfishtail #steaming #prawns #whitefish #herbs #steamed #boiling </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
