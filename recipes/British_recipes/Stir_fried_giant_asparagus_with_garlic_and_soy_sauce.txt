This recipe is ideally suited to the home gardener who probably only has a few stems to deal with at a time, often not enough to use as a serving of [[Vegetables|vegetables]].  This also works with slightly woody stems too. \n\nAs the flavours are immense you only need a sprinkling of them to really lift a meal.\n\nSlice them according to tenderness, the foot quite thin and the 'flower head' leave completely intact.\n===Ingredients===\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| 4 giant [[Asparagus|asparagus]] stems\n| 3 [[Cloves of Garlic, peeled and crushed|cloves of garlic, peeled and crushed]]\n| A pinch of [[Black pepper|black pepper]]\n| A few tablespoons of [[Olive oil|olive oil]]\n| 5ml [[Dark soy sauce|dark soy sauce]]\n}}\n\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| Remove and discard the really woody part of the stems\n| Slice the remaining [[On the diagonal|on the diagonal]], leaving the very tender heads in one piece\n| Heat a [[Frying pan|frying pan]] or a [[Wok|wok]] and add about 4 tablespoons of water and the sliced stems and allow to cook in the [[Steaming|steaming]], bubbling water until it completely dries up\n| Shimmy the pan to allow the [[Asparagus|asparagus]] to get a little [[Seared|seared]]\n| To be on the safe side, you may need to let the pan cool a little before the next stage.\n| With the [[Asparagus|asparagus]] still in the pan, add a few tablespoons of [[Olive oil|olive oil]], a shake of [[Black pepper|black pepper]] and the [[Crushed garlic|crushed garlic]] and cook quite gently for 3 to 5 minutes to allow the flavours to mingle.  Don't let the [[Garlic|garlic]] [[Brown|brown]].\n| Mix well and serve.\n}}\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Stir fried giant asparagus with garlic and soy - steamed.jpg|Slightly coloured after the water has evaporated\nImage:Stir fried giant asparagus with garlic and soy - diagonal.jpg|Chopped on the diagonal according to tenderness\nImage:Stir fried giant asparagus with garlic and soy - size.jpg|Size comparison against a large egg\n</gallery>\n===Variations===\nUse 1 tablespoon [[Sesame oil|sesame oil]] instead of the [[Olive oil]]\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Accompaniments]]\n[[Category:Vegan recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegetable recipes]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n[[Category:Stir fried]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#asparagus #oliveoil #blackpepper #stirfriedgiantasparaguswithgarlicandsoysauce #steaming #crushedgarlic #wok #gravlaxspaghetticream #seared #darksoysauce #stirfried </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
