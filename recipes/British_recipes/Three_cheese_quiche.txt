I would avoid choosing 3 very salty [[Cheeses|cheeses]] as that would make it over-seasoned, so try to get a nice balance.\n===Chef's notes===\nFor the pastry I used [[Shortcrust pastry (TM)|this recipe]] and made the full quantity.  There was enough left over to make a couple of pasties or a small quiche.  It is very difficult to specify how much pastry to make as it depends on the height of your tin and how thick you like your pastry.  I like mine fairly thin.\n{{Quiche - See also}}\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Snacks and light bites]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes]]\n[[Category:Cheese recipes]]\n[[Category:Egg recipes]]\n[[Category:Pies tarts and flans]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#threecheesequiche #bake #cheese #grated #cheddar #bluecheese #cheddarcheese #cheeses #eggyolk #pastry #eggs </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
