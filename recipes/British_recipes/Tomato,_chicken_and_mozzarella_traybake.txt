A chopped up [[fennel]] bulb would be good too.\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Spicy recipes]]\n[[Category:Cheese recipes]]\n[[Category:Chilli pepper recipes]]\n[[Category:Garlic recipes]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:Poultry recipes]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:12032020'>#sageleaves #oliveoil #tomatochickenandmozzarellatraybake #pickled #chickenthighs #mozzarellacheese #garlic #jalapenochillipeppers #britishrecipes #garlicrecipes #italianseasoning</code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
