See Variations below for instructions for partially making in a breadmaker.  Making them all by hand though is much more fun!\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 225ml lukewarm [[Milk|milk]] (approx)\n| 15g fresh [[Yeast|yeast]]\n| 375g [[Strong white bread flour|strong white bread flour]] (I used Waitrose Very Strong Canadian [[Bread]] [[Flour]])\n| &frac12; teaspoons [[Salt|salt]]\n| 30g [[Butter|butter]]\n| &frac12; [[Egg|egg]], beaten\n| A little [[Oil|oil]]\n| 1 tablespoon of [[poppy seeds]], or seeds of your choice (optional)\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Dissolve the [[Yeast|yeast]] in half of the [[Milk|milk]].\n| Meanwhile [[Sieve|sieve]] the [[Flour|flour]] and [[Salt|salt]] into a bowl and rub in the [[Butter|butter]].\n| Make a well in the centre of the [[Flour|flour]] and add the dissolved [[Yeast|yeast]].\n| Stir in with the [[Flour|flour]] and add the [[Egg|egg]] and almost all of the other half of the [[Milk|milk]].\n| Mix to a soft, but not sticky [[Dough|dough]] and add the remaining [[Milk|milk]] if necessary.\n| Lightly [[Flour|flour]] a board or [[Pastry mat|pastry mat]] and [[Kneading bread|knead]] the [[Dough|dough]] for about 10 minutes until smooth and elastic - you can tell when it has been kneaded sufficiently if the dough spring back when you poke it.\n| Place the [[Dough|dough]] in a lightly oiled bowl and cover with [[Cling film|cling film]].\n| Allow to rise in a warm area until it has doubled in size.\n| [[Knock back]] the [[Dough|dough]] and return it to the bowl for a second rising.\n| When it has risen to double its size again, knock the [[Dough|dough]] back and divide into 8 pieces.\n| Shape as desired and sprinkle [[Seeds|seeds]] over them, if using, first [[Brushing|brushing]] them with water.\n| Leave on the [[Baking tray|baking tray]] in a [[warm place]] until doubled in size again.\n| [[Bake]] at 220\u00b0 C (425\u00b0 F - gas 7) for 15 minutes or until golden. \n| Cool on a wire rack.\n}}\n===Variations===\nIf you wish to use your [[Bread maker|bread maker]] to do the kneading, use a 7g sachet of fast action [[Yeast|yeast]] and set it to the longest [[Dough|dough]] programme.  For the [[Panasonic 253 breadmaker]], this is French dough, for the [[Panasonic SD-ZB2502 automatic breadmaker]]. use menu option 21, French dough rise. (3 hr, 35 minutes).\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Accompaniments]]\n[[Category:Bread and baking]]\n[[Category:Breadmaker recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#dough #flour #yeast #whitedinnerrolls #butter #egg #brushing #breadmaking #bread #clingfilm #pastrymat </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
