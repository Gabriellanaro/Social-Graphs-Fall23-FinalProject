Small whole potatoes tend to become 'polished' and don't 'fluff-up' at all.   They are still very crispy, but not as good as square-cut potatoes whole potatoes (pictured).\n\nAnother good way to get 'fluffy' roasties is to crush them slightly, halfway through the cooking process.\n\nA list of the best potato varieties for making [[roast potatoes]] can be '''[[:Category:Potato_recipes#ROAST_POTATOES|found here]]'''.\n\nNote to self: 45 minutes is probably an ideal time to aim for.\n\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Air fried recipes]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Accompaniments]]\n[[Category:Vegan recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes]]\n[[Category:Potato recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegetable recipes]]\n[[Category:Favourite recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#onion #roastpotatoes #oliveoil #airfriedroastpotatoes #airfry #bayleaves #potatoes #boiling #airfried #favouriterecipes #airfrier </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"

It is copied from [[Delia Smith]]'s 'Complete Cookery Course' but with a few changes that over the years have proven to make a perfect [[Batter|batter]] with a good rise.\n\nIn [[Delia]]'s recipe she says it will serve 4 but I disagree, it serves 2 [[Pigs|pigs]] with a few leftover [[Popovers|popovers]].\n\nThe three main tricks to getting a well risen Yorkshire every time are:\n\n* Whisk by [[Hand|hand]], just enough to combine well. Do not use an electric whisk or go mad when hand beating\n\n* Allow the [[Batter|batter]] to reach room temperature by resting for 30 minutes first.  Do not rest in the [[Fridge|fridge]].  This will reduce the rise substantially.\n\n* [[Oil]] the [[Popover|popover]] or [[Yorkshire pudding tray]] and heat over a naked flame just before pouring the [[Batter|batter]] mixture into the tray, then put in the over immediately.\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| 75 g (3 oz) [[Plain flour|plain flour]]\n| 1 large [[Egg|egg]]\n| '''A total of 130 ml (5 fl oz) of liquid, comprised of:'''\n| 75 ml (3 fl oz) [[Milk|milk]] ''any type of milk is fine''\n| 55 ml (2 fl oz) water\n| Pinch of [[Sea Salt|sea salt]]\n| Pinch of [[Freshly ground black pepper|freshly ground black pepper]]\n| 2 tablespoons [[Vegetable oil|vegetable oil]] to grease [[baking tray]]\n}}\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n\n* Preheat the [[Oven|oven]] to 220\u00b0 C (425\u00b0 F - gas 7), [fan oven 200\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]\n\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| Sift the [[Flour|flour]] into a large bowl\n| Add the [[Milk|milk]], water and [[Salt|salt]] and [[Pepper|pepper]] to a jug\n| Make a depression in the middle of the [[Flour|flour]] and break the [[Egg|egg]] into it\n| Using a [[Hand|hand]] whisk, beat the [[Egg|egg]] into the [[Flour|flour]]\n| Once the [[Egg|egg]] and [[Flour|flour]] starts to combine, gradually mix in all of the liquids\n| [[Rest]] at '''room temperature''' for 30 minutes - do not refrigerate\n| Using a silicone [[Brush|brush]], distribute 2 tablespoons of [[Vegetable oil|vegetable oil]] into the [[Yorkshire pudding tray]] or [[Popover tray|popover tray]]\n| Carefully heat the tray on the [[Hob|hob]] top until the [[Oil|oil]] starts to sizzle\n| Pour the [[Batter|batter]] mixture evenly into the tray\n| Pop into the top of the [[Oven|oven]] and [[Bake|bake]] for 25 to 30 minutes\n}}\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Accompaniments]]\n[[Category:Bread and baking]]\n[[Category:Historic recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes]]\n[[Category:Egg recipes]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#flour #egg #batter #hand #yorkshirepuddingtray #vegetableoil #deliasmith #anniebatter #pigs #delia #plainflour </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"

My conclusions: This doesn't work well you don't use [[fillet of beef]]. It's rich enough without adding [[pat\u00e9]].  If you use [[bacon]], it makes it too heavy and hard-going.\n\nIf you are making this for just 2 people, make the [[duxelles]] for 4, split the fillet in to two halves, wrap and bake one (to server two people), leave the other wrapped in [[clingfilm]] and bake that in a few days time for another lovely rich meal. That way you get two nice fresh crispy wellingtons rather than soggy leftovers.  You could also make a [[chicken wellington]] with the other half of the [[duxelles]].\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Historic recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Beef recipes]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:Favourite recipes]]\n[[Category:Pan fried]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#duxelles #beef #beefwellington #parmaham #mushrooms #pastry #brush #butter #thyme #clingfilm #shallots </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"

It even looks like Branston.</span> \n\n<span class=\"reviewAuthor\"> [[User:PSmith|Paul&nbsp;R&nbsp;Smith]] </span></span>\n}}\nBranston Pickle is made from a variety of diced vegetables, including turnips,carrots, onions, cauliflower and gherkins pickled in a sauce made from vinegar, tomato, apple and dates with spices such as mustard, coriander, garlic, cinnamon, pepper, cloves, nutmeg and cayenne pepper.\n\nIt is sweet and spicy with a chutney-like consistency, containing small chunks of vegetables in a thick brown sticky sauce. It is commonly served as part of a ploughman's lunch, a once common menu item in British pubs. It is also frequently combined with cheddar cheese in sandwiches, and most sandwich shops in the UK offer \"cheese and pickle\" as an option. It is available in the standard 'chunky' version, though there is also a 'sandwich' variety, where the vegetable chunks are smaller and easier to spread. In recent times, Premier Foods have also brought out a 'squeezy' variety in a plastic bottle. There was also a spicy type made for a short time, but this did not prove as popular and is now hard to find. \n\nThis is a [[Branston pickle]]-type recipe.  I have adjusted the ingredient list from the common 'Internet' recipe that seems to exist everywhere.  My version is below and I can vouch for its success.  I tend to add [[chillies]] to everything I eat, pickles being no exception. If you are like-minded, you will find the chillies don't make the pickle too hot, they just add just a little bite. However, if your aim is to make a fairly authentic version of Branston pickle, I would add a [[scant]] tablespoon of mustard powder instead.\n\nTo make preparation for this recipe easy, use the ''view a printable shopping list for this recipe'' link, top right, to create your shopping list.  Remember this can take more than 3 hours to prepare and cook, so set plenty of time aside first.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 250 g [[Carrots|carrots]], peeled\n| 3 small white [[turnips]], peeled \n| 10 big [[Cloves|cloves]] of [[Garlic]], peeled and crushed\n| 1 cup [[dried apricots]], chopped\n| 1 cup [[prunes]], chopped\n| 1 cup [[raisins]]\n| 1 medium [[Cauliflower|cauliflower]]\n| 2 large [[Onions|onions]], peeled\n| 2 [[Apples|apples]], peeled and cored\n| 2 [[Courgettes|courgettes]], unpeeled\n| 15 small cocktail [[Gherkins|gherkins]], see Chef's notes\n| 225 g dark [[muscovado sugar]], [[Brown sugar|brown sugar]] or [[Jaggery|jaggery]]\n| 1 teaspoon [[Sea Salt|sea salt]]\n| 60 ml [[Lemon juice|lemon juice]]\n| 350 ml [[Cider vinegar|cider vinegar]]\n| 200 ml [[Malt vinegar]]\n| 1 tablespoon [[Worcestershire sauce]]\n| 2 teaspoons black [[Mustard seeds|mustard seeds]]\n| 4 small dried [[Chile de \u00c1rbol]] powdered in a [[coffee grinder]] or 1 [[scant]] tablespoon of [[mustard powder]] (''see recipe notes'') \n| 1 heaped teaspoon [[Ground allspice|ground allspice]]\n| A big grind of [[black pepper]]\n| 1 to 2 tablespoons of [[caramel colouring]] - see [[Talk:Branston_pickle_recipe#Experiments_with_colouring|comments]] page\n| 1 tablespoon of [[arrowroot powder]] \n\n}}\n\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n* Chop all of the ingredients into 2.5 mm (1/8\u201d) cubes.

Add the caramel colouring and mix well.  Stir and cook for 5 minutes more then remove from the heat and allow to cool properly.\n| Bottle in [[sterilised]] jars, leaving for a month to mature in a cool, dark place.\n}}\n\nFollowing [[Talk:Branston_pickle_recipe#Colour and drying out|comments from a visitor]] regarding the pickle drying out, it may be an idea to cut circles out of [[grease-proof paper]] to lay over the surface of the pickle before finally sealing the bottles.\n===Chef's notes===\nYou could use [[cornflour]] instead of the [[arrowroot]].  I used the latter only because I had some to hand.\n\nUse 1 teaspoon of chili powder if you don't have [[Chile de \u00c1rbol]].\n\nMix the colouring very well or you will get 'darker' areas in the pickle.\n\nI am not totally convinced that it is necessary to add ''pickled'' gherkins to a recipe that is to be pickled - however, it won't do any harm.  I added a full 340g jar of small pickled gherkins with vinegar to the most recent batch I made and it tasted perfect.

However we both agreed that as they were they could easily have serve 4 people, especially if served with extra vegetables.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 1 medium [[Onion|onion]], peeled and finely chopped\n| 3 Cloves [[Garlic|garlic]], peeled and thinly sliced\n| 2 tablespoons of  [[Olive oil]]\n| [[Freshly ground black pepper|freshly ground black pepper]]\n| 170 g coarse [[Pork|pork]] and [[Mushroom|mushroom]] p\u00e2t\u00e9\n| 6 rashers [[Bacon|bacon]]\n| 2 large [https://www.cookipedia.co.uk/calories/chicken/bq/2#jump chicken breasts]\n| 375g Jus Rol, ready rolled [[Puff pastry|puff pastry]]\n| 2 [[Egg yolks|egg yolks]] for [[Brushing|brushing]] the [[Pastry|pastry]].\n}}\n\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n* Preheat the [[Oven|oven]] to 220\u00b0 C (425\u00b0 F - gas 7), [fan oven 200\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]\n===Method===\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Chicken Wellington ready to bake.jpg|[[Chicken]] Wellingtons, ready to bake\nImage:Chicken Wellington rolled in cling-film.jpg|Roll in cling-film and chill\nImage:Chicken Wellington bacon spread with pate.jpg|Bacon spread with and pate\nImage:Chicken Wellington Pate, onions and garlic, ready to spread.jpg|Pate, onions and garlic, ready to spread\nImage:Chicken Wellington ingredients.jpg|[[Chicken]] Wellington, the ingredients\n</gallery>\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Add the [[Olive oil|olive oil]] to a small pan and give it a good grind of [[Black pepper|black pepper]]\n| Very gently [[Fry|fry]] the [[Garlic|garlic]] and [[Onions|onions]] for 10 minutes in the [[Oil|oil]] until soft\n| Add the p\u00e2t\u00e9, heat and stir until it breaks down and mingles with the [[Onions|onions]]. remove from the heat and allow to cool a little.\n| Lay 3 rashers of [[Bacon|bacon]] out on a large sheet of [[Cling-film|cling-film]] and spread half of the [[Pate|pate]] over the bacon\n| With a sharp knife, make a pocket in the [[Chicken breast|chicken breast]] and add a tablespoon of [[Cranberry|cranberry]] jelly\n| Lay the [[Chicken breast|chicken breast]] on the [[Bacon|bacon]] and with the [[Help|help]] of the [[Cling-film|cling-film]], roll up into a parcel and 'twizzle' the ends to seal.\n| Repeat for the other [[Chicken breast|chicken breast]].\n| Chill in the [[Refrigerator|refrigerator]] for 30 minutes, at the same time, remove the [[Puff-pastry|puff-pastry]] and allow it to reach room temperature.\n| After 30 minutes, remove the [[Cling-film|cling-film]] and wrap each [[Chicken|chicken]]/[[Bacon|bacon]] parcel in [[Puff pastry|puff pastry]].

Fully [[defrosted]].\n\nWe used the small oven of our [[Smeg_Opera_cooker|Smeg Opera cooker]], the contraptions that supper the oven shelves were removed to make available space wider.\n\nRemove any giblets, cut off and discard the [[Parson's nose]].\n\nIt was cooked for 3 hours, 10 minutes at 190\u00b0 C (375\u00b0 F - gas 5) then rested for 30 minutes in the same [[Oven|oven]], with the heat switched off.

We did not have to carve the [[Turkey|turkey]], honestly, I just placed it very heavily on the chopping board and it fell apart, yet the skin was still crispy as you can see.

At first it looked as though it would never fir in the oven, however after it was fully de-frosted and a little more of the protruding neck bone was removed, it fitted in - just.

If you want tasty flavourful [[Gammon|gammon]] that can be 'carved' by pushing a spoon on to it, then the answer is simple: 1 hour at full pressure and allow the [[Pressure cooker|pressure cooker]] to depressurise naturally.\n\nThis simple formula works for most [[Gammon|gammon]] joints between 1kg & 1.8kg; the standard size for rolled gammon.\n\nIf your joint is smaller, cook it for 45 minutes.  That's the answer!\n\nTo add a little extra flavour I've used some [[Citrus fruits|citrus fruits]] and [[Herbs|herbs]].  It was delicious, moist and extremely tasty!\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| 1.6 kg rolled [[Gammon joint|gammon joint]], rind removed\n| 2 [[Oranges|oranges]]\n| 1 [[Grapefruit|grapefruit]]\n| Big bunch of [[Sage|sage]]\n| Sprig of [[Thyme|thyme]]\n| Good pinch of [[Freshly ground black pepper|freshly ground black pepper]]\n}}\n\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| Put the [[Fresh herbs|fresh herbs]] into the [[Cooker|cooker]].\n| Put the pot stand in the [[Pressure cooker|pressure cooker]] and fill with a couple of inches of hot water, so the inner pot is just above the water level.\n| Cut the [[Grapefruit|grapefruit]] into enough slices to line the base of the inner pot.\n| Remove all of the plastic wrapping from the [[Gammon joint|gammon joint]], if applicable.\n| Sit the joint on top of the [[Grapefruit|grapefruit]] slices.\n| Cut the [[Oranges|oranges]] into halves and surround the [[Gammon|gammon]] with them.\n| Sprinkle everything with a good amount of [[Black pepper|black pepper]].\n| Close the [[Pressure cooker|pressure cooker]], bring to full pressure and cook for one hour.\n| Allow to depressurise naturally.\n}}\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Bunch_of_herbs_in_pressure_cooker.jpg|Put a big bunch of herbs in the base of the pressure cooker\nImage:Gammon_joint_on_grapefruit_slices.jpg|Sit the gammon joint on slices of grapefruit\nImage:Cooking gammon in a pressure cooker recipe.jpg|Surround the gammon joint with citrus fruit\nImage:Gammon_joint_pressure_cooked_in_one_hour.jpg|Pressure cooked ham cooking for one hour\nImage:The_gammon_falls_apart_after_cooking.jpg|The joint of gammon just falls apart; perfectly cooked\nImage:Pressure_cooked_gammon.jpg|Perfectly cooked in 1 hour, tender and juicy and carved with a spoon!\n</gallery>\n\n===Serving suggestions===\nGreat as a '[[Roast|roast]]' dinner, and fantastic served cold, as a [[Salad|salad]].\n===Variations===\nI noticed that black pepper sprinkled over the gammon joint at the start of cooking remained until the very end.  On that basis, it would be pefectly possible to roll the ham joint in flavourings before cooking which would give you a lovely flavoured outside.  Will try this soon!\n===Chef's notes===\nNote to self: With this amount of water, electric hob setting 9 is fine to bring to pressure without burning the contents.

Have the bowl of batter as close to the frying pan as possible, then dip the Spam and transfer into the hot oil immediately. Slide the fritter off the fork with a knife or other metal implement. '''Do not use your fingers at any point - severe burns can occur!!'''\n\nAlternatively, if you're handy with a pair of chopsticks, you can grip the end of the Spam with them and do the dipping and transferring that way. For me, the only disadvantage of this method is that there is always a 'naked' uncovered bit on the fritter. Forking it is the only way!!!\n\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Cooking with beer]]\n[[Category:Historic recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:Beef recipes]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:North American recipes]]\n[[Category:Student recipes]]\n[[Category:Pan fried]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#cornedbeeffritters #guinness #bitter #batter #tabascosauce #electricmixer #branstonpickle #bakedbeans #fry #egg #refrigerator </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"

Do not add [[Salt|salt]] at this stage!\n| Beat into a thick [[Batter|batter]], preferably using your [[Hand|hand]], but a whisk would be fine.\n| Cover with [[Clingfilm|clingfilm]] and keep at room temperature overnight.  \n}}\n'''The [[Dough|dough]]'''\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Mix the remaining [[Flour|flour]] and the [[Salt|salt]] into the sponge to form a fairly stiff, but not too stiff, [[Dough|dough]].\n| Allow to rest, covered for 10 minutes\n| Knead for about 15 minutes or until the [[Dough|dough]] quickly springs back when poked.\n| Form into a ball, place in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with [[Clingfilm|clingfilm]] and allow to prove for about an hour.\n| Knock back and repeat steps 3 and 4.\n}}\n'''Shaping'''\n{{RecipeMethod\n| [[Knock back]] the [[Dough|dough]], weigh it, and break off a piece which is rather under a third of the weight of the whole.\n| Roll each piece into a ball, turning the folds underneath .\n| Leave each piece to rise separately, covering each one with a large upturned bowl, for 45 minutes.  It is better to allow the larger piece to rise on the [[Baking|baking]] tin or stone on which it will be [[Baked|baked]].\n| Carefully flatten the top of the bottom piece and using a sharp knife or [[Grignette|grignette]], cut a 4cm cross in the middle.\n| Flatten the bottom of the topknot and moisten the bottom with some water.\n| Place in the centre of the larger piece of [[Dough|dough]].\n| Using the handle of a wooden spoon, make a hole through the centre of the topknot down into the body of the bottom piece.\n| If you wish to slash the bread, do so at this stage.\n| Cover with a [[Tea towel|tea towel]] and leave to prove for a further 10 minutes.\n}}\n'''[[Baking]]'''\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Carefully put the [[Bread|bread]] onto the lowest rack in the [[Oven|oven]] and switch it on now, setting it at 230\u00b0 C (450\u00b0 F - gas 8), [fan oven 210\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour].\n| [[Bake]] for about 30 minutes, then reduce the heat to 200\u00b0 C (400\u00b0 F - gas 6), [fan [[Oven|oven]] 180\u00b0C] for the remaining 10 minutes.\n| Remove from [[Oven|oven]] and allow to cool on a wire rack.\n}}\n===Chef's notes===\nMaking a sponge first encourages the [[Yeast|yeast]] to act vigorously without the hindrance of [[Salt|salt]], which is why the salt is only added at the [[Dough|dough]] stage.\n\nIf you find the sponge [[Fermenting|fermenting]] too rapidly, [[Refrigerate|refrigerate]] whilst you are in bed and first thing in the morning, put it back in the kitchen for a while to come back to room temperature.\n\nThe process of using the end of a wooden spoon to make a hole in the [[Bread|bread]], is known as 'bashing' and is done to join the top and bottom halves of the loaf.\n\nThe reason the [[Oven|oven]] is not switched on until the loaf is in it is that it will have a chance to expand further and recover from its 'bashing'.\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Bread and baking]]\n[[Category:Vegan recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes]][[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#dough #yeast #bread #cottageloaf #flour #baking #clingfilm #knockback #wholemeal #batter #refrigerate </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"

I have amended it to use a [[slow cooker]] and for once, used commercial [[curry powder]] rather than a homemade blend.\n\n===Update===\nThe ingredients shown below have been much reduced from the original recipe because, to my taste, it was almost bitter.  To rescue the meal, I discarded all of the original gravy and served it with potatoes, carrots, peas and a normal [[onion gravy]].

It is a basic preparation used in stuffings and [[sauces]] (notably, [[beef Wellington]]), or as a garnish. Duxelles can also be filled into a pocket of raw pastry and baked as a savoury tart (similar to a hand-held pie).\n\n'''Duxelles''' is made with any cultivated or wild mushroom, depending on the recipe. Duxelles made with wild [[porcini mushrooms]] will be much stronger flavoured than that made with [[white mushrooms]] or [[brown mushrooms]].

One anecdotal story is that the dessert was invented when a Labrador accidentally sat on a picnic basket in the back of a car on the way to a picnic.\n\nEton mess was served in the 1930s in the school's \"sock shop\" (tuck shop), and was originally made with either [[Strawberries|strawberries]] or [[Bananas|bananas]] mixed with [[Ice cream|ice cream]] or cream. Meringue was a later addition.\n\nThe trick to making successful meringues seems to be turning the oven heat down, immediately they go into the oven and then killing the heat after an hour and not touching them until the oven is completely cold.  It's something I learned from following Delia Smith and it has served me in good stead ever since.

It originated in England in the mid 1700s, and it reached its peak of popularity in the early 1900s. The original recipe requires only ginger, sugar, and water, to which is added a gelatinous substance called \"ginger beer plant\" (see below).\n \n[[Fermentation]] over a few days turns the mixture into ginger beer. [[Lemon]] may be added. A simple version of this recipe can be made at home today in which the following is bottled in a 2 litre bottle: [[Grated|grated]] [[Fresh ginger|fresh ginger]], sugar, a small amount of baker's [[Yeast|yeast]], and (optionally) [[Lemon juice|lemon juice]]. \n\nIt is sealed at room temperature for a day or two before refrigerating.\n\nInstead of using the ginger [[Beer|beer]] plant, some other form of live culture may be used to produce [[Fermented|fermented]] ginger beer. This is often baker's or [[Brewer's yeast|brewer's yeast]], but can also be a culture of [[Lactic acid|lactic acid]] bacteria, [[Kefir|kefir]] [[Grains|grains]], or tibicos. [[Ginger]] beer is fizzy due to carbon dioxide. \n\nThe [[Alcohol|alcohol]] content when produced by the traditional process can be high, up to 11%, although it is possible to [[Ferment|ferment]] ginger beer in such a way as to produce little alcohol. Ginger beer may be mixed with beer (usually a British [[Ale|ale]] of some sort) to make one type of shandy, and with Gosling's Black Seal [[Rum|rum]] to make a drink, originally from Bermuda, called a Dark 'N' Stormy. The soda version of ginger beer is the main ingredient in the Moscow Mule cocktail.\n\nThe [[Beverage|beverage]] produced industrially today is often not brewed ([[Fermented|fermented]]). Such ginger [[Beer|beer]] is [[Carbonated|carbonated]] with pressurised carbon dioxide, does not contain [[Alcohol|alcohol]], and is sold as a [[Soft drink|soft drink]]. [[Ginger]] beer is similar to ginger [[Ale|ale]] except that it has a significantly stronger ginger taste, often being described as ginger ale with a kick to it. \n\nIts other distinctive properties include its traditional cloudy appearance, its predominately [[Citrus|citrus]] sour taste base and its spicy ginger bite.\n\nThis recipe is taken from \"Modern practical cooking\" - circa 1900\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 1 gallon [[Boiling|boiling]] water\n| 14 oz loaf [[Sugar|sugar]]\n| 1 [[Lemon|lemon]]\n| &frac34; oz lump of [[Ginger|ginger]], bruised\n| &frac12; oz solid [[Yeast|yeast]]\n| 2 teaspoonfuls of [[Castor sugar|castor sugar]]\n| 1 teaspoonful of [[Cream of tartar|cream of tartar]]\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Wipe the [[Lemon|lemon]] and peel very thinly\n| put the rind in a large jar or pan, and add the lump [[Sugar|sugar]], [[Ginger|ginger]] and [[Cream of tartar|cream of tartar]]\n| Pour [[Boiling|boiling]] water over these ingredients, and stir together. Leave until lukewarm.\n| Mix the [[Yeast|yeast]] and [[Castor sugar|castor sugar]] together until they become liquid, then stir into the other ingredients with the [[Lemon juice|lemon juice]].\n| Partly cover\n| Leave in a warm place for 12 hours\n| Remove the scum, strain the [[Ginger|ginger]] [[Beer|beer]] and bottle\n| Cork the bottles very securely and tie the corks with wire\n| Leave for about 4 to 5 days\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nPour into a glass, being careful to leave the sediment behind\n===Modernising this recipe.===\nI would be inclined to use [[Jaggery|jaggery]] in place of 'lump [[Sugar|sugar]]', or just use [[Brown sugar|brown sugar]] or [[Castor sugar|castor sugar]].\n\nUse a little more than 1/2 a teaspoon of brewers [[Yeast|yeast]] instead of solid [[yeast]].\n\nStore the bottles in a cool place and take very great care when handling or opening.  Even I can remember my Grandfather's legendary tales of ginger beer bottles exploding in the night and setting up a chain reaction.\n{{Template:PeelingGinger}}\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Accompaniments]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Historic recipes]]\n[[Category:Snacks and light bites]]\n[[Category:Sweets and desserts]]\n[[Category:Vegan recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes]]\n[[Category:Uncooked]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#gingerbeer #ginger #beer #yeast #lemon #castorsugar #carbonated #softdrink #ale #boiling #fermented </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"

It is a fast-ripening, acidic tasting cheese. The cheese is especially good if made from [[Ewes' milk|ewes' milk]].\n\nWell, I can't resist meddling, so although this started as [[Caerphilly cheese]], it may end up as something completely different as I have also added 300 ml of [[double cream]] to the [[milk]].\n\nAs I update these notes, the cheese is only 6 days old and more than half of it has been eaten!  It is absolutely delicious and everyone who has tasted, nibbled, devoured it, thought it wonderful.  It has an acidic tang with a really creamy after-taste.  An absolute success.  Making more today to see if I can get a batch to reach maturing age before being eaten.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 5 [[Litres|litres]], full [[Fat|fat]] [[Milk|milk]]\n| 5 ml [[liquid starter]] or a little [[DVI]] (an aspirin sized heap)\n| 1.5 ml [[Rennet|rennet]]\n| [[Salt]] for  [[Dry salting]]:\n|*[[Dry salting]], 1.5% per weight of [[Curd|curd]] (15g to 1 kg of curd)\n| [[Brine concentrate]]: 18% (180 ml [[Salt|salt]] [12 level tablespoons]  per 1 litre of water)\n}}\n\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n* [[Sterilise]] all equipment\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Home-made Caerphilly cheese pressing.jpg|Lightly pressing (3 kg)\nImage:Home-made Caerphilly cheese salting.jpg|Dry-salting the small pieces\nImage:Home-made Caerphilly cheese draining.jpg|Draining the curds\nImage:Curd draining.jpg|Press the sieve down and drain with a ladle\n</gallery>\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Pasteurise the [[Milk|milk]] in a [[Double boiler|double boiler]] and leave to cool to 30\u00b0 C.\n| Add the [[liquid starter]] or sprinkle om the [[DVI]] and leave for 30 minutes.\n| Dilute the [[Rennet|rennet]] in 5ml of cold [[Boiled|boiled]] water and add to the [[Milk|milk]].\n| Mix well.\n| Leave until the [[Curd|curd]] sets. This should take about an hour or so but may take longer.\n| Once set, [[Cut the curds|cut the curds]] into 6mm cubes and leave for 15 minutes, gently agitating the pan now and then.\n| Very gently, over a 30 minute period, increase the temperature to 34\u00b0.  I find the most reliable way to do this is by adding a little [[Boiling|boiling]] water to the water already in the [[Double boiler|double boiler]].  This prevents you raising the temperature too quickly.\n| Using a ladle, drain off as much [[whey]] as you can without further breaking up the [[curds]]. Try to keep the temperature at 34\u00b0 (covering with a cloth or working in a warm environment helps here). {Just discovered a really neat way to speed up the curd draining.  Rather than fiddle about with a ladle at the edge of the pan, press down gently with a sieve and ladle the whey from the middle of the sieve. ''See picture''.}\n| After 30 minutes, remove blocks of curds and pile them in a heap onto a [[cheesecloth]] placed over a [[cheese draining mat]].  A (very clean) fish-slice is good for this.\n| After 20 minutes, break the [[Curds|curds]] into much smaller pieces and [[dry-salt]] them (2%).\n| Lift the cheesecloth and place into your mould. I used a [[Colander|colander]].\n| Wrap and cover and lightly press (I used about 3 kg of weight).\n| After 1 hour, turn the cheese over and sprinkle with salt.  Leave it pressing for 24 hours.\n| The next day, make up an 18% [[Brine|brine]] solution and immerse the [[Cheese|cheese]] for 24 hours.\n| Allow to dry and allow 2 weeks to ripen.\n| Unless you have a cave handy, the [[fridge]] is probably the best place to mature your [[homemade cheese]] although it's really going to be too cold. After discovering the top shelf of my often-opened fridge could be as much as 5\u00b0 C warmer than the bottom, I've decided to mature my cheeses there.  As all fridges differ, check various areas of your fridge with a thermometer to find the area that is around 11\u00b0C [51\u00b0 F], the ideal 'cave' temperature.\n}}\n===Chef's note===\nMost [[cheesemaking]] recipes I have seen mention [[Pasteurisation|pasteurising]] the milk first.  This assumes you have unpasteurised milk which, though better for [[cheesemaking]], can be difficult to obtain unless you have your own dairy. If like me, you are using shop-bought, pasteurised [[milk]], ignore the pasteurising step.  Just start with the milk at 30\u00b0 C.\n\nIf you are using cream, add it with the milk after the pasteurising step (assuming it is already pasteurised). I used double cream, which gives it a really creamy after-taste but single cream would be just as good.  The amount of milk is not overly important either as long as your draining system and mould is large enough.\n\nThe recipes I have seen suggest rubbing the cheese with flour to 'finish' it.   I am uncertain about this as I feel it's likely to form an undesirable mould, as bread does.

Whisk to mix. Cover with a clean [[Tea-towel|tea-towel]] and leave for 30 minutes.\n| Add 2ml of [[Rennet|rennet]] to 1 tablespoon of cold, previously [[Boiled|boiled]] water, mix well and add to the  [[Milk|milk]].\n| Whisk to mix, cover and leave in a warm place (about 22\u00b0C) until the curd sets.\n| Lay a boiled cheesecloth on a [[draining mat]] and then ladle all of the curds on to the cheesecloth.  The picture shows 3/4 of the curds - I had to put the rest into a second tray.\n| Fold to cover the curds and leave to stand in the [[whey]] for 60 minutes.\n| Wind one corner of the cheesecloth around the other three corners to make a Stilton knot (a kind of noose).\n| Hang the bag up to drain off the [[whey]].\n| Every 30 minutes for the next two hours, tighten the bag a little more.\n}}\n'''Salting and packing the curds'''\n{{RecipeMethod\n| After 2 hours, cut the [[curds]] into [[walnut]]-sized cubes.\n| Sprinkle the cubes evenly with table salt at a ratio of 28g per 1200g of curd.\n| Pack the [[curds]] into unlined moulds but don't compress them. (I used a colander as a mould for this batch)\n| Leave the [[curds]] for 5 days, turning daily to ensure it can still drain freely.  I stored mine in a the salad container in the fridge with a bowl of water in a vain attempt to maintain humidity.  Ideally a little warmer (cave-like) would be more ideal.\n| After 5 days, the cheese should have shrunk away from the sides of the mould.\n| Use a spatula to rub the surface of the cheese flat so there are no holes on the outside.\n| Cover with [[cling-film]] or rub with vegetable oil to seal the surface and leave to mature in a cool damp place.  Again, if you have a cave, that would be ideal!  Try to maintain a degree of humidity if possible.\n| After 5 days, remove the cling-film and create the airways for the veining to form by piercing the cheese at regular intervals with a sterilised knitting needle or kebab skewer.  (Take a close look at the high-resolution image of [[Stichelton cheese]] to see how the commercial cheese makers do this.)\n}}\nLeave to mature for as long as you can bear! A wooden or wicker plate is good for this as it won't make the cheese sweat. The ideal conditions are 8\u00b0C to 12\u00b0C at 90% humidity.\n\nUnless you have a cave handy, the [[fridge]] is probably the best place to mature your [[homemade cheese]] although it's really going to be too cold. After discovering the top shelf of my often-opened fridge could be as much as 5\u00b0 C warmer than the bottom, I've decided to mature my cheeses there.

I increased the amount to 6 litres. This produced about 1.2 kg of set curds at the packing stage.\n'''Temperature and humidity are very important'''.\n \nI have been known for a certain degree of impatience, not least when it comes to waiting for cheese to mature!  Well, after a week in wraps and a further week in the fridge at 8\u00b0C, sitting over a bowl of water in the salad crisper, I was most disappointed not to have a neatly veined piece of blue cheese. Pondering this dilemma on the hottest day of the year, I thought maybe a few days in a homemade humidifier, placed in our cool garage, might help things along a little.  The next morning when I scampered out to the garage to check progress, my pure white Stilton had overnight, turned into a huge blue furry football!  A quick check of my [[Minimum-maximum thermometer|minimum-maximum thermometer]] showed that it had got as warm as 22\u00b0C - far too warm, hence all the fur. \nRubbed clean of its blue fur coat, crumbled and re-constituted into a Stilton cylinder, it is back in the fridge and there it will stay for the next 3 months - caveat nibbler. \n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes|Stilton]]\n[[Category:Cheese recipes|Stilton]]\n[[Category:Cheese making|Stilton]]\n[[Category:British recipes|Stilton]]\n\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n[[Category:Snacks and light bites|Stilton]]\n[[Category:Starters|Stilton]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes|Stilton]]\n[[Category:Blue cheeses|Stilton]]\n[[Category:Uncooked]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#curds #homemadestiltontypecheese #whey #dvistarter #penicilliumroqueforti #penicilliumroquefortii #pasteurised #homemadecheese #fridge #stilton #sticheltoncheese </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"

Will do this again.</span>\n \n<span class=\"reviewAuthor\"> [[User:Klapaucius|Klapaucius]])</span></span>\n}}\nWhilst ready-made [[Pastry|pastry]] is widely available, there may be times when you want to make your own.  Ready-made pastry is [[Frozen|frozen]] and if you are in a hurry, it is quicker to make your own than wait for the frozen to [[de-frost]].\n\nMost ready-made [[Pastry|pastry]] will contain manufactured [[Fat|fat]], whereas you can choose your own fat type if you make it yourself.\n\nTraditionally, a mixture of half-[[Lard|lard]] and half-[[Butter|butter]] was considered the ideal mixture and it probably still is.  However, as a vegetarian, I always use 100% [[butter]].\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 250 g [[Plain flour|plain flour]], sifted\n| &frac14; teaspoon [[icing sugar]]\n| 6 g [[Salt|salt]]\n| 125 g cold [[Butter|butter]], cut into small chunks and chilled\n| About 75 ml iced water\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Mix the [[Flour|flour]] with the [[icing sugar]] and [[Salt|salt]] in a bowl and add the chunks of [[Butter|butter]].\n| If making the [[Pastry|pastry]] manually, cut the [[Butter|butter]] into the [[Flour|flour]] with cold scissors, until the mixture is like fine [[Breadcrumbs|breadcrumbs]].\n| To ensure that the [[Butter|butter]] has been sufficiently incorporated, shake the bowl back and forth.  Any large lumps will come to the surface and you can cut them in again.\n| Add the cold water, not all at once, stirring with a fork to mix it in.\n| Keep adding the water until you can form the mixture into a compact and non sticky ball, which will hold together.\n| Wrap in [[cling-film]] and place in the [[Fridge|fridge]] for half-an-hour before use.\n| This can be made in a [[Food processor|food processor]], in which case process the [[Flour|flour]], [[Salt|salt]] and [[Butter|butter]] together, using the pulse setting.  Slowly add the water and the mixture should automatically form itself into a ball when enough water has been added.  Do not over-process though, as it will make the mixture too warm.  A stand [[mixer]], if you have one, would be better than using a [[Food processor|food processor]].\n}}\n===Variations===\nYou can make additions to the [[Pastry|pastry]], eg. [[Spices|spices]], [[Cheese|cheese]] and [[Sugar|sugar]] (for a sweet pastry).  \n\n===Chef's notes===\nOnce the [[Pastry|pastry]] has rested in the [[Fridge|fridge]], roll it out according to your recipe's instructions and add the other ingredients.  However, I always put it back in the fridge at this stage for a further 30 minutes, before I put it into the preheated oven.  I do this even with ready-made [[pastry]].\n==See also==\n[[P\u00e2te bris\u00e9e]]'''\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes|Pastry shortcrust]]\n[[Category:Bread and baking|Pastry shortcrust]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Pies tarts and flans|Pastry shortcrust]]\n[[Category:Uncooked]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#butter #pastry #homemadeshortcrustpastry #flour #icingsugar #foodprocessor #fridge #plainflour #mixer #cheese #fat </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"

Now and again for a special treat!</span> \n\n<span class=\"reviewAuthor\"> [[User:PSmith|Paul&nbsp;R&nbsp;Smith]] </span></span>\n}}\nHot water crust is a type of pastry used for savoury pies, such as [[pork]] pies, game pies, etc. Hot water crust was traditionally used for making hand-raised pies.\n\nAs the name suggests, the pastry is made by heating water, melting the [[fat]] in this, bringing to the [[boil]], and finally mixing with the [[flour]]. This can be done by either beating the [[flour]] into the mixture in the pan, or by kneading on a pastry board. Either way, the result is a hot and rather sticky paste that can be used for hand-raising - shaping by hand, sometimes using a dish or bowl as an inner mould. As the crust cools, its shape is largely retained, and it is filled and covered with a crust, ready for [[baking]]. Hand-raised hot water crust pastry does not produce a neat and uniform finish, as there will be sagging during the cooking of the filled pie. This is generally accepted as the mark of a hand-made pie. It is possible, however, to [[bake]] the pastry in a mould, as with other pies.\n\nRaised pies are easier to make whilst the pastry is warm.\n\n'''There is a recipe for [[Melton Mowbray style pork pies|Melton Mowbray style pork pies here]].'''\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 225 g (8 oz) strong [[plain flour]]\n| Pinch of crushed [[sea salt]]\n| 25 ml (25 g) (1 fl oz) [[milk]]\n| 25 ml (25 g) (1 fl oz) water\n| 75 g (3 oz) [[lard]] or [[shortening]]\n| 1 large [[egg yolk]], whisked, for glazing and sealing\n}}\n\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n* Preheat the oven to 180\u00b0 C (350\u00b0 F - Gas 4)\n\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Sift the [[salt]] and [[flour]] into a bowl\n| Mix the water and [[milk]] into a medium-sided pan and heat gently\n| Cut the [[lard]] into small pieces and drop into the [[milk]]/water mix\n| Once the [[lard]] has completely melted, raise the heat and bring to the [[boil]] and then immediately remove from the heat\n| Pour into the [[flour]] and, using a wooden spoon, mix well\n| Dust a chopping board with a little extra [[flour]] and [[Kneading bread|knead]] the [[dough]] for a minute or two\n| Two thirds of the dough for the pies and 1/3 for the lids\n| Divide the larger piece into 6 and roll into balls and, using your hands, mould each ball into a pie shape (an upturned glass is useful for this)\n| ''Fill the pies with your desired filling''\n| Using a pastry [[brush]], paint a little of the [[egg yolk]] around the rim of each pie\n| Divide the remaining third into six pieces, roll into balls and then roll each ball flat to make the pie lids\n| Crimp the lids to the pies with the tines of a fork and glaze the pies with any remaining [[egg yolk]]\n| Make a little slash or hole in the top of each pie to allow [[steam]] to escape and [[bake]] on a tray for about 50 to 55 minutes\n| Allow to cool on a wire rack\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\n\nServe warm or cold\n\n===Chef's notes===\n\nHaving made these, I would suggest that this quantity is better suited to 4 slightly larger pies.

I prefer the [[pressure cooker]] method, it's quickest and the most economical way.  With modern [[pressure cookers]] I use the smallest gas ring on the lowest setting , it makes no noise or steam and only takes an hour.\n\nPrepare them with a quick rinse, being careful not to break the skin and then trim the leaves leaving about 2.5 cm (1 inch) and leave the roots intact.  We will remove both of those when they are cooked.  This prevents them from bleeding badly while they are cooking.\n\n===Cooking beetroots in a pressure cooker===\n\nTrim the beets as above, fill the cooker to just below the trivet stand and place the beetroots in the steamer basket and sit on the trivet.  Bring to high pressure and cook for about 50 minutes and allow to de-pressurise naturally. The beets are cooked when the root  is soft enough to penetrate with a skewer and the skin moves easily when rubbed with your fingers.\n\nWhen the beets are cooked, trim the roots and stems completely and rub the skins off with your fingers, using rubber gloves if you don't want purple fingers.\n===Cooking beetroots by boiling in a pan===\n\nTrim the beets as above, place in a lidded pan, just covered with boiling water, cover and boil for an 1 hour 30 minutes (depending upon size) or until the beetroot is soft enough to penetrate with a skewer and the skin moves easily when rubbed with your fingers.\n\nWhen the beets are cooked, trim the roots and stems completely and rub the skins off with your fingers, using rubber gloves if you don't want purple fingers.\n<gallery widths=250px perrow=5>\nImage:Beetroots cooked and trimmed.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Cooked skinned and trimmed\nImage:Trimmed beets ready to cook.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Leaves trimmed, roots left alone, ready to boil, steam or roast\n</gallery>\n===Cooking beetroots by steaming in a pan===\n\nTrim the beets as above, place in a steamer with the pan filled with about 5 cm (2 inches) of boiling water, cover and steam for an 1 hour 30 minutes (depending upon size) or until the beetroot is soft enough to penetrate with a skewer and the skin moves easily when rubbed with your fingers.\n\nWhen the beets are cooked, trim the roots and stems completely and rub the skins off with your fingers, using rubber gloves if you don't want purple fingers.\n===Cooking beetroots in the oven===\n\nBeetroots can be roasted or steamed in the over.\n\n=====Roasting beets in the oven=====\n\n:'''150\u00b0 C (300\u00b0 F - gas 2), [fan oven 130\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]'''\n\nTrim the beets as above, wrap them in [[tin foil]], place the foil parcels in a [[roasting tray]] and roast in the middle of the oven at 150\u00b0 C (300\u00b0 F - gas 2), [fan oven 130\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour] for 2 to 3 hours. The beets are cooked when the root  is soft enough to penetrate with a skewer and the skin moves easily when rubbed with your fingers.\n\nWhen the beets are cooked, trim the roots and stems completely and rub the skins off with your fingers, using rubber gloves if you don't want purple fingers.\n\n=====Steaming beets in the oven=====\n\n:'''150\u00b0 C (300\u00b0 F - gas 2), [fan oven 130\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]'''\n\nTrim the beets as above, place them in a lidded casserole dish filled with 5 cm (2 inches) of boiling water and steam in the middle of the oven at 150\u00b0 C (300\u00b0 F - gas 2), [fan oven 130\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour] for 2 to 3 hours.

It appeared in a 100 page booklet, ''Mrs. Mary Eales's Receipts''\n===The recipe===\nTake Tin Ice-Pots, fill them with any Sort of Cream you like, either plain or sweeten'd, or Fruit in it; shut your Pots very close; to six Pots you must allow eighteen or twenty Pound of Ice, breaking the Ice very small; there will be some great Pieces, which lay at the Bottom and Top: You must have a Pail, and lay some Straw at the Bottom; then lay in your Ice, and put in amongst it a Pound of Bay-Salt; set in your Pots of Cream, and lay Ice and Salt between every Pot, that they may not touch; but the Ice must lie round them on every Side; lay a good deal of Ice on the Top, cover the Pail with Straw, set it in a Cellar where no Sun or Light comes, it will be froze in four Hours, but it may stand longer; than take it out just as you use it; hold it in your Hand and it will slip out. When you wou'd freeze any Sort of Fruit, either [[Cherries]], [[Raspberries]], [[Currants]], or [[Strawberries]], fill your Tin-Pots with the Fruit, but as hollow as you can; put to them Lemonade, made with Spring-Water and Lemmon-Juice sweeten'd; put enough in the Pots to make the Fruit hang together, and put them in Ice as you do Cream.\n===Mrs. Mary Eales's Receipts===\nMrs. Mary Eales's Receipts was published in London in 1718 and again in 1733, the second time also under the title of The compleat confectioner [''sic'']. It was first called, \"I love Laura Dantsis\". It was published in 1744 with an additional called A curious collection of receipts in cookery, pickling, family physick, &c. added by the publisher, R. Montagu. (The author of the latter part is unknown.) A facsimile of the 1733 edition was published in 1985 by Prospect Books (ISBN 0-907325-25-4).\n\nMrs. Mary Eales is listed on the cover as confectioner to her late Majesty Queen Anne; there is no external verification or disproval of this claim. It was the first English cookbook to include a recipe for [[ice cream]]. Many of the recipes are of the form of \"To preserve something\", or \"To dry something\", with many of the rest being recipes for creams, jams, jellies, or pastes, with the occasional chip, cake or biscuit recipe. The 1733 edition has 126 recipes and is exactly 100 pages long, plus the title page and table of contents.\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Historic recipes]]\n[[Category:Sweets and desserts]]\n[[Category:Ice-cream recipes]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Fruit recipes]]\n[[Category:Frozen]]\n{{RecipeSkip}}\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:12032020'>#strawberries #sweetsanddesserts #fruitrecipes #raspberries #frozen #cherries #historicrecipes #icecream #currants #britishrecipes #recipes </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"

Cut about halfway through the [[Fat|fat]].\n| Using plenty of [[Salt|salt]] and [[Pepper|pepper]], season the [[Lamb|lamb]] on both sides, ensuring you get plenty into the slashes you have made.\n| Smash the [[Garlic|garlic]] bulb to separate all of the [[Cloves|cloves]] and place half of them, unpeeled, in the base of a suitable sized [[roasting tray]].\n| Distribute most of the [[Rosemary|rosemary]] stems evenly into the base of the tray.\n| Sit the [[Meat|meat]], skin-side upwards, into the [[roasting tray]] and place the remaining [[Garlic|garlic]] [[Cloves|cloves]] on the top of the skin, together with the remaining [[Rosemary|rosemary]] stems.\n| Drizzle 3 or 4 tablespoons of [[Olive|olive]] [[Oil|oil]] over the skin of the [[Lamb|lamb]].\n| Cover with 2 layers of [[tin-foil]] and fold the edges over the edge of the [[roasting tin]] to ensure a good seal.\n| Check that the oven has reached its highest temperature and place the joint in the oven on the top shelf and '''immediately turn the oven down to 160\u00b0 C (325\u00b0 F - gas 3)'''\n| Leave to roast slowly for 4 hours.\n| After 4 hours, remove the [[Lamb|lamb]], together with the [[Garlic|garlic]], and put the meat on a preheated plate. Cover loosely with a piece of foil and leave to rest for a while before carving and serving with the sauce. \n}}\n\n'''To make the hot mint and caper sauce'''\n# Discard most of the [[Rosemary|rosemary]] and any excess [[Oil|oil]], leaving just the lovely caramelised juices from the [[roasting]].\n# Heat the [[roasting tray]] on the hob and add a tablespoon of plain [[Flour|flour]] and stir well to soak up all of the lovely juices.\n# Roughly chop the [[Mint|mint]] leaves and the [[Capers|capers]] and add to the [[roasting tray]].\n# Squeeze a few of the roasted garlic cloves into the gravy.\n# Add the [[Chicken|chicken]] [[Stock|stock]] to the tray, stirring well to thicken, but don't cook it for ages.\n# Add a final splash of [[Sherry|sherry]] [[Vinegar|vinegar]] to the gravy, stir and serve.\n\n===Serving suggestions===\n\nServe hot with [[squash mash]] and [[Parmesan turnip tops]].\n\n===Chef's note===\nIf you are using a smaller joint then you can reduce the cooking time; a small (800g) joint would only need half the cooking time.  However, it wont hurt to cook it longer as it will just do a better job of breaking down the collagen and sinews.  It's also worth noting that Lamb is safe to eat rare.\n\nDon't be put off a recipe that calls for a leg of lamb because of the high cost.  This recipe can be adjusted for [[Frozen lamb - what great value!|half a leg of lamb and you buy that (frozen)]] for just \u00a36.00!

The recipe in the book is served with [[Smoked salmon|smoked salmon]] but I'm just using this recipe as a simple way to make a Yorkshire pudding.\n\nYou need to be sure that your [[Frying pan|frying pan]] is ovenproof.  The quantities are perfect for a 28cm  ovenproof [[Frying|frying]] pan.  The measurements are usually shown on the base of the pan to save measuring it.\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| 2 tablespoons [[Olive oil|olive oil]]\n| 2 large [[Fresh eggs|fresh eggs]]\n| 150 ml [[Semi-skimmed milk|semi-skimmed milk]]\n| 65 g [[Plain flour|plain flour]]\n| Pinch of [[Salt|salt]] (optional)\n| Pinch of [[Freshly ground black pepper|freshly ground black pepper]] (optional)\n| Chopped [[Fresh herbs|fresh herbs]] (optional)\n}}\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n\n* Preheat the [[Oven|oven]] to 200\u00b0 C (400\u00b0 F - gas 6), [fan oven 180\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]\n\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| Put 2 tablespoons of [[Olive oil|olive oil]] into the [[Frying pan|frying pan]] and set over a medium heat. If you've added a pinch of black pepper to the oil, add the batter when the pepper begins to sizzle. Don't let the [[Oil|oil]] smoke\n| If you want to add [[Salt|salt]], [[Pepper|pepper]] and [[Fresh herbs|fresh herbs]], add them to the [[Liquidiser|liquidiser]] now\n| Add the [[Eggs|eggs]], [[Milk|milk]] and [[Flour|flour]] to your [[Liquidiser|liquidiser]] and blitz until perfectly smooth\n| Pour the [[Batter|batter]] into the pan and [[Fry|fry]] for 30 seconds only.  Give the pan a final swirl after the 30 seconds is up to spread the batter to the edges of the pan\n| Pop the pan into the [[Oven|oven]] for about 13 minutes or until cooked to your liking\n| Serve!\n}}\n===Recipe source===\n\n* Idea from Jamie Oliver's 15 minute meals\n\n===Variations===\n[[Yorkshire puddings]] can be served as a dessert; we always used to have them with [[Golden syrup|golden syrup]] as children - give it a try!\n===Chef's notes===\nIn trying to perfect this imperfect recipe, I've made this almost daily, with slight variations. I would normally cook a [[Yorkshire pudding]] for 20 minutes but I guess that would break the 15 minutes rule. Here's my tips for improving this recipe if you have a little more time than Jamie:\n\n* Whisk the batter just long enough to combine, don;t over mix\n* Use only [[plain flour]], not [[self-raising flour]] or [[strong bread flour]]\n* Leave the batter mix to rest at room temperature while the oven heats\n* Add the [[olive oil]] to the pan and leave the pan in the oven while it gets to the correct temperature\n* Don't bother heating the batter mix on the stove top\n* Cook for 18 minutes at the top of the oven\n===See also===\n* [[Perfect Yorkshire puddings]] - ''this is a far better recipe!''\n* [http://www.amazon.co.uk/Jamies-15-Minute-Meals-Jamie-Oliver/dp/071815780X Jamie Oliver's 15 minute meals book on Amazon UK]\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Accompaniments]]\n[[Category:Historic recipes]]\n[[Category:Snacks and light bites]]\n[[Category:Egg recipes]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n[[Category:Pan fried]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#oliveoil #yorkshirepudding #liquidiser #freshherbs #plainflour #yorkshirepuddings #goldensyrup #eggs #frying #flour #miseenplace </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"

The [[Dough|dough]] should be fairly sticky, so add more water if necessary.\n| Knead, using your desired method until you have an elastic [[Dough|dough]].\n| Shape into a ball and leave it to rest for an hour in an oiled bowl, covered with [[Clingfilm|clingfilm]], until the [[Dough|dough]] has almost doubled in size.\n| Lightly [[Flour|flour]] a work surface and gently deflate the [[Dough|dough]].\n| Knead briefly and repeat the two previous steps.\n| Gently spread the [[Dough|dough]] on a floured work surface and roll out until it is about 5mm thick.\n| Using a plain 6cm [[Pastry|pastry]] cutter cut out circles of [[Dough|dough]] and place them on a [[Baking tray|baking tray]].\n| Lightly dampen the circles with water.\n| Cut out the equivalent number of circles again and place on top of the others.\n| Dampen the top circles and go through the same process a 3rd time.\n| Cover with a damp cloth and leave to prove for up to 45 minutes.\n| [[Bake]] at 230\u00b0 C (450\u00b0 F - gas 8), [fan [[Oven|oven]] 210\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour] for 15-20 minutes. \n| Allow to cool on a wire rack.\n}}\n===Variations===\n* Stages 1-11 can be done in a food [[Mixer|mixer]].\n* Stages 6-11 can be done in a [[Breadmaker|breadmaker]] on the longest [[Dough|dough]] setting.\n*Stages 1-11 can also be done in a [[Thermomix]]. Add the sponge ingredients all together, having dissolved the [[Yeast|yeast]]. Mix for 6-20 seconds at Speed 3 until the [[Dough|dough]] has formed into a ball that begins to clean the sides of the bowl. Add the remaining [[Flour|flour]] and the [[Salt|salt]] the next day and [[Kneading bread|knead]] for 90 seconds at the kneading setting. Tip the TM bowl upside down on a lightly floured surface . Loosen the blades by undoing the blade unit at the base. The weight of the blades will [[Help|help]] the dough to drop out of the bowl onto the surface. Pull any remaining bits of dough off the blades and out of the bowl. Continue from step 12. \n===Chef's notes===\nYou will find that the rolls slant somewhat during rising but that is part of their charm!

Cut large potatoes into   fairly small even-sized pieces so they cook at the same rate.\n\nIf you have free access to fresh bay leaves, use them!  Scatter a handful into the vegetable mix at the start.  The same for any left over lemon pieces, squeeze the lemon juice over the vegetables and scatter the pieces over the vegetables.  They can be discarded at before serving but they add a little more aroma and flavour to the dish.\n\nNot being a white-[[Wine|wine]] drinker, but having [[Sherry|sherry]] for cooking, if [[White wine|white wine]] is called for I often mix [[Dry sherry|dry sherry]] with a little water instead.\n==See also==\n* {{See also - Jointing a chicken}}\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:Potato recipes]]\n[[Category:Poultry recipes]]\n[[Category:Cooking with wine]]\n[[Category:Stewed, braised or pot roasted]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#newpotatoes #chicken #lemonandbayleafchickenwithnewpotatoes #garlic #lemon #greensalad #oliveoil #whitewine #bellpeppers #redonion #bayleaf </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"

Sprinkled a little extra cheese on the top and baked these for 15 minutes at 180\u00b0 C (350\u00b0 F - Gas 4).\n<GoogleBanner>recipe-pages</GoogleBanner>\nI have to say that I found the hot water crust pastry unbelievably greasy and not very nice at all.  I will repeat the experiment using shortcrust pastry, which may not be authentic but will probably be nicer.\n===Visitor's tip for making hot-water crust pastry===\nYou want to make the pie crust with as cold water as possible. The dough should also be worked together as quickly as possible, not to generate to much heat.\n\nLeave to rest in the fridge for 30 min before rolling it out.  --Siri-Ann \n===See also===\n\n* [[West Indian macaroni pie]]\n* [[Hot water crust pastry]]\n* [[Melton Mowbray style pork pies|Melton Mowbray style pork pie]]\n[[Category:Ingredients]]\n[[Category:Prepared foods]]\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Pasta recipes]]\n[[Category:Cheese recipes]]\n[[Category:Egg recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Boiled or simmered]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n{{RecipeSkip}}\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:12032020'>#hotwatercrustpastry #westindianmacaronipie #basicmacaronicheese #boiledorsimmered #britishrecipes #unusualrecipes #pastarecipes #macaronicheese #maincourses #blindbaked #eggrecipes </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"

I spotted the [[Gressingham Memphis Barbecue Pulled Duck]] in Morrisons and thought it would make a good [[Taco|taco]] filling. \n\nThe [[Duck|duck]] was very good and I'll be getting more today.  Do note though that the duck is notreally pulled duck, it's duck legs with a sauce that need to be ''pulled'' once they've been cooked.  \n\nThe Old El Paso [[Tacos|tacos]] however, ''really'' let this recipe down.  They are so thin now that they break apart as you touch them. Any because they are so miserably thin, they don't even have the crunch purported on the packet.  Another cynical attempt at increasing profits I guess.\n\nIf you don't want to use the flimsy El Paso [[Tacos]], try to hunt down the cheaper and far nice Discovery [[Taco trays|taco trays]], or forget tacos altogether and use [[Corn|corn]] or [[Flour tortillas|flour tortillas]] instead.\n\nThe [[Duck|duck]] feels like it might serve 4 but is actually contains 2 duck legs, a [[Foil|foil]] tray and a sachet of [[Sauce|sauce]], plenty for 2 people, not enough for four.\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| 1 pack [[Gressingham Memphis BBQ Pulled Duck]] (2 duck legs in with [[Barbecue sauce|barbecue sauce]])\n| 1 Pack Discovery [[Taco trays|taco trays]] or if you must ,1 Pack El Paso [[Taco shells]] (see notes above)\n| 6 [[Spring onions|spring onions]]\n| 12 [[Baby tomatoes|baby tomatoes]]\n| Half a green [[Sweet Pepper|sweet pepper]]\n| 10 [[Black cherries|black cherries]]\n| 150 ml pot of [[Sour cream|sour cream]]\n}}\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n\n* Preheat your [[Oven|oven]] to 180\u00b0 C (350\u00b0 F - gas 4), [fan oven 160\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Memphis BBQ pulled duck tacos ingredients.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The basic ingredients\nImage:Gressingham Memphis Barbecue Pulled Duck.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Gressingham Memphis Barbecue Pulled Duck]] (whole duck legs with sauce)\n</gallery>\n\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| Remove the [[Duck|duck]] legs from the plastic wrapping and place in the tray provided, make sure you include all the lovely [[Fat|fat]] too!\n| Leave the [[Sauce|sauce]] sachet to one side for now\n| [[Roast]] the [[Duck|duck]] legs at 180\u00b0 C for 25 minutes, uncovered, in the tray provided\n| After 25 minutes, drain and discard some of the cooking juices (see [[Chef's notes]] below).\n| Add the contents of the Memphis [[Barbecue sauce|barbecue sauce]] to the duck's legs and mix well\n| [[Bake]] for a further 10 minutes\n| When there is 5 minutes remaining pop the [[Taco trays|taco trays]] or fragile El Paso [[Taco shells|taco shells]] into the [[Oven|oven]] to warm up\n| Meanwhile: chop the [[Spring onions|spring onions]] ([[Scallions|scallions]])\n| Halve the [[Tomatoes|tomatoes]]\n| Halve the [[Cherries|cherries]] and remove the stones\n| Chop the [[Green pepper|green pepper]]\n| Using two forks, shred the [[Duck|duck]] legs with two forks\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe the pulled [[Duck|duck]], [[Vegetables|vegetables]] and [[Tacos|tacos]] and [[Sour cream|sour cream]] in separate dishes so diners can assemble the tacos at the table\n===Variations===\nUse whatever filling ingredients that take your fancy, some other suggestions, sliced red onions, avocado, pickled chillies, crispy lettuce, pineapple chunks.\n===Chef's notes===\nThe [[Gressingham BBQ Pulled Duck]] (legs) are already pre-cooked. If you are using [[Fresh duck|fresh duck]] legs, they will will probably take about the same time, but the [[Oven|oven]] could do with being 1 little warmed (190\u00b0 C - 200\u00b0 C) and they will benefit from resting for 15 minutes once removed from the oven.\n\nThe cooking instructions on the [[Gressingham Pulled Duck]] suggests discarding all of the cooking juices after 25 minutes of [[Roasting|roasting]]. I would definitely suggest otherwise.  Next time I will mix them in with the [[Barbecue sauce|barbecue sauce]], and not waste them.\n\nI allowed the juices to solidify overnight and it was almost all lovely tasty jelly, hardly any [[Fat|fat]] - made a great [[Sandwich|sandwich]] filling and reminded me of jelly and [[Dripping|dripping]] of old.\n{{Tortillas-See also}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:North American recipes]]\n[[Category:Tex-Mex recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Spicy recipes]]\n[[Category:Fruit recipes]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n[[Category:Barbecue recipes]]\n[[Category:Poultry recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#duck #memphisbbqpulledducktacos #barbecuesauce #tacotrays #tacos #tacoshells #springonions #sourcream #sauce #fat #cherries </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"

As served on Shrove Tuesday or Pancake day in the UK and Australia.  Better known in the USA as Mardi Gras or Fat Tuesday. Historically, pancakes were made on Shrove Tuesday so that the last of the fatty and rich foods could be used up before Lent.  This recipe makes 8 pancakes.\n\n===Swedish pancakes===\n\nThe recipe for traditional Swedish pancakes is the same as below, except that they might be served with a local preserve such as [[lingonberry]] jam.  They are traditionally follow [[\u00c4rtsoppa (Swedish pea soup)]] on a Thursday if what I read is to be believed.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 200 ml (7fl oz) [[milk]] mixed with 75 ml (3fl oz) cold water\n| 2 [[free range eggs]]\n| 110 g (4 oz) [[plain flour]], sifted\n| 50 g (2 oz) [[butter]]\n| pinch of table [[salt]]\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Sift the [[salt]] and [[flour]] into a large mixing bowl. Hold the sieve high so the [[flour]] gets combined with lots of air\n| Make a well in the centre of the [[flour]] and break the [[eggs]] into it.\n| With a spatula mix the [[eggs]] and [[flour]] together\n| Ideally with an electric hand mixer, gradually add the milk and water mix whilst whisking. Your goal is a smooth [[batter]] with no lumps or stray bits of [[flour]]\n| There is no need to leave the mixture to stand, make the pancakes straight away\n| Heat the [[butter]] in a heavy [[frying]] pan, swill it around so the pan is well oiled but not [[dripping]] in [[fat]].  Pour the remaining [[butter]] into a plate to use for the remaining pancakes\n| Use 2 tablespoons of [[batter]] mixture per pancake, dolloped in the middle of the pan and instantly swirl the pan around to distribute the [[batter]] around the whole of the pan\n| Cook for about 30 seconds on the first side and about 15 seconds on the other side\n| Dab a little more [[butter]] on the [[frying]] pan before every fresh pancake\n| Stack them up on a plate, separated with sheets of grease proof paper and keep them warm in a very low oven\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\n* Serve with a squeeze of [[lemon juice]] and sprinkled with [[caster sugar]]\n* Try a little pineapple or strawberry jam or a little bit of [[honey]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Breton buckwheat pancake recipe]]\n* [[Cr\u00eape recipe]]\n* [[Potato pancakes]]\n* [[Crispy duck pancake recipe]]\n* [[Crispy potato pancakes]]\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Egg recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Starters]]\n[[Category:Sweets and desserts]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Pan fried]]\n[[Category:Swedish recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#pancakes #flour #butter #batter #frying #eggs #castersugar #freerangeeggs #dripping #fat #lemonjuice </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"

They are commonly served with cold meats and [[cheeses]] such as [[Stilton]].  There use in the United Kingdom dates back to before 1800, however there is some evidence that walnuts were pickled in the Persian area some 8000 years ago.\n\nCharles Dickens mention pickled walnuts in ''The Pickwick Papers'':\n\n<blockquote>However, there he lay, and I have heard my uncle say, many a time, that the man said who picked him up that he was smiling as merrily as if he had tumbled out for a treat, and that after they had bled him, the first faint glimmerings of returning animation, were his jumping up in bed, bursting out into a loud laugh, kissing the young woman who held the basin, and demanding a mutton chop and a pickled walnut. He was very fond of pickled walnuts, gentlemen. He said he always found that, taken without vinegar, they relished the beer.</blockquote>\n\nThey are also an ingredient in [[Wow-wow sauce]], historically served with [[beef]].\n\n{{RecipeLine}}\n{{CategoryLineIngredients}}\n[[Category:Ingredients]]\n[[Category:Prepared foods]]\n[[Category:Store cupboard items]]\n[[Category:Pickles and preserves]]\n[[Category:Historic recipes]]\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Accompaniments]]\n[[Category:Pickles and preserves]]\n[[Category:Tapas, mezze and antipasti]]\n[[Category:Pickled]]\n\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:12032020'>#pickledwalnutrecipe #picklednuts #picklesandpreserves #preparedfoods #walnuts #beef #maltvinegar #storecupboarditems #historicrecipes </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"

Blending other [[Vinegars|vinegars]] and [[Spices|spices]] enhances the flavour of the finished [[Vinegar|vinegar]] and the addition of [[Sugar|sugar]] removes the harshness.\n\n[[Jaggery]] or other 'dark' [[Sugars|sugars]] such as [[Demerara|demerara]] and [[Muscovado|muscovado]] also adds a more interesting flavour than pure [[White sugar|white sugar]].

This recipe is inspired by the Ploughmans' lunch: [[ham]], [[cheese]], [[Branston pickle]], [[tomatoes]] and variations thereof.  Following a true ploughmans', obviously [[Cheddar]] would be the [[cheese]] of choice, however, I spotted some lovely oak barrel aged [[feta]] so used that instead.\n\nThese deep-dish pizzas are excellent cooked the moment the dough has been made, but if time and conditions allow, they are even better if left in a warm place to rise first.  They then become light and airy with a sponge-like texture.  As this is a rare warm sunny day, I'm going to leave this one out to rise for a few hours before it's cooked.\n\n===How to ensure a crispy base===\nHaving made these deep pan pizzas many, many times, I've found that sometimes it's hard to get the base well cooked without burning the rest of the [[pizza dough]].  I've found the best way is to use a meta-based pan, similar to a baking tray.  The metal base gets hot enough to crisp the base properly.  I have a really heavy rectangular Le Creuset baking tray that is absolutely ideal.  It seems a shame as it will mean I'll never use my earthenware deep pan pizza dish again!\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 180 g good quality sliced [[ham]].\n| 1 portion of [[Pizza dough|pizza dough]]\n| [[Fine yellow cornmeal|fine yellow cornmeal]] for dusting\n| 150 g (5 oz) [[Feta cheese]], crumbled or sliced\n| 50 g (2 oz) freshly [[Grated|grated]] [[Parmesan cheese]]\n| 1 400 g can of chopped peeled [[Tomatoes|tomatoes]], left to drain over a coarse sieve for 15 minutes or more.\n| &#189; teaspoon of dried [[oregano]]\n| Freshly ground [[black pepper]]\n| 4 tablespoons [[Branston pickle]]\n\n}}\n\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n* Preheat the [[Oven|oven]] to 190\u00b0 C (375\u00b0 F - gas 5), [fan oven 170\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]\n* Make the [[Dough|dough]] as instructed\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Ploughmas deep pan pizza ready to rise.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Left to rise for an hour or so\nImage:Branston Pickle pizza.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Plenty of Branston pickle\n</gallery>\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| [[Spray]] or lightly [[Oil|oil]] a deep 25cm (10\") pizza dish or pan\n| Roll out two thirds of the [[Dough|dough]] to about 3mm and line a pan so the [[Dough|dough]] just  overlaps the edges and trim any excess\n| Sprinkle the base with two thirds of the [[Feta cheese]]\n| Layer the ham over the cheese.\n| Spread the [[Branston]] in a thick layer, over the ham.\n| Sprinkle with one third of the [[Parmesan cheese]]\n| Roll out the remaining [[Dough|dough]] to make a lid\n| Pinch the lid so it joins the base and make a few slashed in the top for [[Steam|steam]] to escape\n| Mix another third of the [[Parmesan cheese]] with the [[oregano]] and [[black pepper]] and mix into the [[Tomatoes|tomatoes]]\n| Spread the tomato mixture over the top of the [[Dough|dough]]\n| Top with remaining crumbled [[feta cheese]] and the rest of the [[Parmesan cheese]]\n| [[Bake]] for 45 minutes, resting a sheet of [[Tin-foil|tin-foil]] on top of the [[Pizza|pizza]] for the final 10 minutes\n| Allow to cool for 5 minutes before slicing and serving\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe with a [[Green salad|green salad]]\n\n===Chef's notes===\nA fantastic pizaa.

I have taken it verbatim from the wonderful, wonderful book; [[Cookbook: Food In England|Food in England - Dorothy Hartley]] which is now available again as it has been reprinted and re-issued. Recommended.\n\n===[[Servings]]===\n\nTwa-three slices o' potted hough per person!\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| [[Shin of beef]]\n| 3 [[black peppercorns]]\n|  A blade of [[mace]]\n}}\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Take the hough and bash it well with an axe.\n| No' just beark it, but have at it , 'till the pieces are no bigger than a wee hen's egg.\n| Pack it into an iron pot with the papery brown skins of onions, two or three peppercorns and a blade of mace. just cover with water, set on the lid lightly, and let it stew for four hours at least.\n| When the meat is away from the bone, tilt it all into a colander, strain the liquid back into the saucepan, and let it gallop while you are gathering up the meat from the broken [[bones]]. \n| Press the meat into a basin with straight sides, and when the meat is all in, fill up with the liquid and set aside 'til cold.\n| It should set stiff.  If it no' sets stiff, you must reduce again for it should be stiff as glue.\n}}\n===Scotch woman's tip===\n\nDo not add vegetables, or over-season with herbs, when cooking this dish, as\n\nit is not a 'made' dish, in the usual sense: it is most essentially a plain\n\ndish of solid meat.  It turns out a brawn, but the texture is much more firm.\n\nThe Scotch woman who gave me the recipe said \"All o' mie want no more than\n\ntwa-three slices o' potted hough, and a well of baked taties, and a fresh\n\nlettuce and mustard-maybe twa-three pickles would go wi' it well-and a tankard\n\nof ale-'twill fill them fine-'tis all guid meat\", and as she was a mother of\n\nfour champion blacksmiths she knew what she was strengthening.\n{{RecipeLine}}\n{{RecipeSkip}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Beef recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:historic recipes]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Stewed, braised or pot roasted]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:12032020'>#pottedhough #bones #beefrecipes #unusualrecipes #meatrecipes #recipes #historicrecipes #britishrecipes #maincourses #servings </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"

It won't hurt if it's left for a little longer.\n| Check the chicken has reached a [[safe cooking temperature]] [74 \u00b0C (165 \u00b0F)]\n}}\n===Variations===\nUse a packet of [[Taco seasoning]] as a rub for the [[Chicken|chicken]] or make your own here: [[Tex-Mex seasoning]]\n===Chef's notes===\nI would start with a medium sized chicken unless you are sure that a large chicken will fit.  We have a large Morphy Richards 6.5 litre slow cooker and a small chicken fitted easily, but I'm not so sure that a large one would fit.\n\n'''A little more environmentally friendly:''' Revisiting this recipe, the reason for the [[aluminium foil]] is just to stop the [[chicken]] overcooking should it make contact with the [[crockpot]]. It seems rather wasteful to use so much [[aluminium foil]] and then chuck it away afterwards so I looked for an alternative.  An ovenproof plate would be good but it has to be surprisingly small to fit in a slow cooker.  After a few experiments, a lattice of spoons worked the best. I still use a ball of [[aluminium foil]] on each side to hold the legs away from the edge of a cooker.\n\nYou could also rest the chicken on some [[carrots]], [[parsnips]] and [[onions]] which would serve the same purpose.\n==See also==\n* www.ibelieveicanfry.com/2013/04/slow-cooker-rotisserie-chicken.html\n* http://www.paleocupboard.com/slow-cooker-rotisserie-chicken.html\n* [[Slow cooker chicken (slow cooker recipe)]]\n* [[Roasting a turkey in a slow cooker]]\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:North American recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:Poultry recipes]]\n[[Category:Slow cooker recipes]]\n[[Category:I believe I can fry recipes]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n[[Category:Slow cooked]]\n[[Category:Recipes from other sites]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#chicken #aluminiumfoil #roastingachickeninaslowcooker #slowcooker #onion #oliveoil #freshherbs #tacoseasoning #heart #smokedpaprikapowder #liver </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"

However it is perfectly possible to slow cook a turkey crown, turkey breast or a turkey leg.\n\nIn the UK our local supermarket (Morrisons) sell a 1600g [3.5 lb] [[Turkey|turkey]] leg, separated into two pieces for just \u00a34.50, compared to \u00a324 for a turkey crown.  The leg is ideal for prolonged cooking and it '''''will''''' [[Roast|roast]] in the [[Slow cooker|slow cooker]].\n\nI've used a massive amount of [[Fresh herbs|fresh herbs]] from our garden to give this joint masses of flavour.\n\nThe [[Roasting|roasting]] occurs because the [[Turkey|turkey]] is kept out of the [[Stock|stock]] by sitting it on 5 or 6 balls of scrunched up [[Baking|baking]] [[Foil|foil]], a large [[Onion|onion]], halved and a bed of [[Herbs|herbs]].  I've used 500 ml of stock and 6 rashers of streaky [[Bacon|bacon]] to prevent the turkey from [[Drying|drying]] out. Plus some [[Garlic|garlic]] for extra flavour.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| 1.6kg [1lb 8oz] [[Turkey|turkey]] leg (separated)\n| 6 rashers of streaky [[Bacon|bacon]]\n| 1 large [[Onion|onion]], unpeeled and cut into two halves\n| 5 [[Cloves of garlic|cloves of garlic]], unpeeled and smashed under the flat of a knife\n| Large pinch of [[Freshly ground black pepper|freshly ground black pepper]]\n| Large bunch of [[Fresh herbs|fresh herbs]].

The 'recipe' is here: [[Meatballs from sausages]]\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| Pinch of [[Black pepper|black pepper]]\n| 2 tablespoons of [[Olive oil|olive oil]]\n| 1 small [[Onion|onion]], very finely chopped\n| Cooked [[Meatballs|meatballs]] from 3 meaty [[Sausages|sausages]]\n| 1 portion of [[Pizza dough]] (makes 2 [[Pizzas|pizzas]])\n| About 6 tablespoons of [[Tomato sauce for pizza]] or [[Passata|passata]]\n| 2 balls [[Mozzarella cheese|mozzarella cheese]] torn into small pieces(about 250g in total)\n| Fresh [[Basil leaves|basil leaves]], chopped finely\n| [[Sea Salt|sea salt]] and [[Freshly ground black pepper|freshly ground black pepper]]\n| Half of a Polish pickled red pepper, chopped, ''optional''\n}}\n\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| Dust your work surface with [[Fine yellow cornmeal|fine yellow cornmeal]]\n| Divide the [[Pizza dough|pizza dough]] into two and roll out into two thin 25.5 cm (10 inch) [[Pizzas|pizzas]]\n| You can leave them in a [[Warm place|warm place]] for an hour or so to rise. I quite like them cooked immediately they are rolled out for a more crispy finish.\n| Prick the [[Pizza|pizza]] all over with a fork. This prevents it puffing up too much and burning while it is cooking\n| With a deft move, slide the [[Pizza|pizza]] from the [[Pizza peel|pizza peel]], on to the preheated [[Pizza stone|pizza stone]].\n| Cook on one side only for about 2 minutes or until lightly [[Browned|browned]].\n| Remove from the [[Oven|oven]] and distribute a ball of torn [[Mozzarella cheese|mozzarella cheese]] over the  [[Pizza|pizza]].\n| Spread the [[Tomato sauce|tomato sauce]] over the top of the [[Cheese|cheese]] -  this helps to keep the [[Pizza|pizza]] base dry and crispy.\n| Crumble the [[Meatballs|meatballs]] and arrange over the topping and drizzle with [[Olive oil|olive oil]] - preferably the [[Oil|oil]] the meatballs were cooked in.\n| Return to the [[Oven|oven]] and [[Bake|bake]] until the [[Cheese|cheese]] is nicely melted. This should take about 4 minutes under a [[Grill|grill]] on a [[Pizza stone|pizza stone]], if oven [[Baking|baking]], about 15 minutes in the middle of the oven.\n| Repeat for the second [[Pizza|pizza]].\n| Keep the first [[Pizza|pizza]] warm at the bottom of the [[Oven|oven]] whilst you make the second.\n}}\n===Chef's notes===\nUse a little extra [[Olive oil|olive oil]] when cooking the [[Sausage|sausage]] [[Meatballs|meatballs]] and use this flavored [[Oil|oil]] to top the [[Pizza|pizza]] before it is [[Baked|baked]].\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Italian recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:Pork recipes]]\n[[Category:Pizza recipes]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n[[Category:Pan fried]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#pizza #meatballs #oliveoil #sausages #pizzadough #pizzastone #pizzas #cheese #mozzarellacheese #sausagemeatballpizza #panfried </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"

For other [[Breadmakers|breadmakers]], follow your manufacturer's instructions regarding the order in which you add your ingredients.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 1&frac14; teaspoons fast action [[Dried yeast|dried yeast]]\n| 550g [[Strong wholemeal flour|strong wholemeal flour]] (I like to use Waitrose Very Strong Canadian [[Wholemeal flour|wholemeal flour]])\n| 1&frac12; teaspoons [[Granulated sugar|granulated sugar]]\n| 25g [[Butter|butter]]\n| 1&frac12; teaspoons [[Salt|salt]]\n| 360ml sparkling water\n| 2 tablespoons each of [[Linseeds|linseeds]], [[Sesame seeds|sesame seeds]], [[Pumpkin seeds|pumpkin seeds]], black [[Mustard seeds|mustard seeds]] and [[Sunflower seeds|sunflower seeds]]\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Add the ingredients (except the [[Seeds|seeds]]) in to your machine in the order given - non-Panasonic owners should refer to their manufacturer's instructions as to the order you should add them.\n| If you have a [[Nut|nut]] dispenser, place the [[Seeds|seeds]] into it.\n| Set to Whole [[Wheat]] - [[Bake]] [[Raisin]] and the [[Bread|bread]] will be [[Baked|baked]] in 5 hours.\n| For Panasonic machines without a dispenser, add the [[Seeds|seeds]] when you hear the beep.\n| For other machines, select a [[Wholemeal|wholemeal]] programme which kneads for roughly 15-10 minutes, rises for at least 2 hours 20 minutes and bakes for around 50 minutes.\n| When the [[Baking|baking]] time has ended, remove from the pan and allow to cool for at least 20 minutes before slicing.\n| Again, other makes of machine may recommend that the loaf should be left in the pan before the final cooling.\n}}\n===Variations===\nVary the [[Seeds|seeds]] if desired, but ensure that you restrict your large seeds to two and use three smaller seeds.  A suggestion for large ones is [[Melon|melon]] seeds.  Smaller seeds could include [[Poppy|poppy]], [[Celery|celery]], yellow [[Mustard|mustard]], [[Nigella|nigella]], [[Chilli|chilli]] etc\n===Chef's notes===\nRemember that the addition of ingredients such as [[Seeds|seeds]] will give a heavier [[Dough|dough]], which is why I recommend using Canadian [[Wheat flour|wheat flour]] which is very strong.  If your usual [[Wholemeal flour|wholemeal flour]] makes a denser loaf, you could add a crushed [[Vitamin C tablet|vitamin C tablet]] to the [[Flour|flour]].  It is to your personal taste.\n==See also==\n{{Wholemeal bread recipes-See also}}\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Bread and baking]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes]]\n[[Category:Breadmaker recipes]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#seeds #seededwholemealbread #nut #bread #wholemealflour #granulatedsugar #flour #chilli #wholemeal #strongwholemealflour #sesameseeds </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"

If it tastes anything like as good as [[Beef Wellington]], the recipe on which it is based, it should be fantastic.\n\nThe origin of the recipe is purported to satisfy the requirement of a very rich and fulfilling meal that could be easily transported when hunting and shooting.  Sounds feasible!\n\nIt's pretty simple really; A loaf of [[Bread|bread]], hollowed out and filled with a sandwich of [[Beef|beef]] steaks that are stuffed with a layer of [[Duxelles|duxelles]] ([[Shallots|shallots]], [[Mushrooms|mushrooms]], [[Garlic|garlic]], [[Butter|butter]], [[Thyme|thyme]] and seasoning).  The loaf is then pressed under a heavy weight to flatten it - making it easier to carry I imagine\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 300g good quality [[Beef|beef]] steaks not too thick\n| 250 g [[Mushrooms|mushrooms]]\n| 4 [[Shallots|shallots]], peeled and finely chopped\n| 2 Cloves of [[Garlic|garlic]], peeled and crushed - or to taste\n| 4 tablespoons of [[Butter|butter]] (or butter / [[Oil|oil]] mixture)\n| 50 ml [[Dry sherry|dry sherry]]\n| Splash of [[Lemon juice|lemon juice]]\n| Sprig of [[Thyme|thyme]]\n| [[Sea Salt|sea salt]] and [[Freshly ground black pepper|freshly ground black pepper]]\n| A splash of interesting [[Sauce|sauce]] to liven it up a little - [[Worcestershire sauce]], [[Chilli sauce|chilli sauce]] etc.\n| 1 suitably shaped loaf of [[Bread|bread]] that is to your taste.  Most recipes seem to use white bread but I prefer wholemeal. \n}}\n===Method===\n\n\n''' [[Duxelles]]:'''\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Gently saut\u00e9 [[Garlic|garlic]] and [[Shallots|shallots]] in the  the finely chopped [[Mushrooms|mushrooms]] in the [[Butter|butter]] for about 6 minutes until soft.\n| Add the chopped [[Mushrooms|mushrooms]] and the whole sprig of [[Thyme|thyme]] and gently cook for 10 minutes so most of the [[Mushroom|mushroom]] [[Liquor|liquor]] is cooked off.\n| remove the sprig of [[thyme]]\n| Add the [[Wine|wine]], a splash of [[lemon juice]] and season to taste.\n| Cook gently until all of the liquid has gone.\n| The [[Duxelles|duxelles]] should stick together easily.\n| Remove from the heat and allow to cool.\n}}\n'''[[Steak]]'''\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Hammer the steak really well with a [[steak mallet]] so it is quite thin and almost doubled in size.  Cut into two pieces.\n| [[Fry]] the steaks to your liking in a little [[Butter|butter]] or [[Olive|olive]] - drain any excess [[Fat|fat]] after [[Frying|frying]]\n}}\n'''[[Bread]]'''\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Slice a 'lid' off the loaf, leaving enough room in the remaining loaf to stuff with the steaks and [[Duxelles|duxelles]]\n| Hollow out the lid and loaf and discard or whizz up in a [[Food-processor|food-processor]] to make [[Breadcrumbs|breadcrumbs]] for another time\n| Lay the first [[Steak|steak]] in the base of the loaf - trim and arrange to fit, see photos\n| Add the [[Duxelles|duxelles]] mixture\n| At this point you could add spread with some [[English mustard]] or [[Horseradish sauce|horseradish sauce]].  I [[Fried|fried]] the steaks in [[Chilli oil|chilli oil]] so have omitted this step\n| Cover with the remaining [[Steak|steak]]\n| Replace the 'lid'\n| Wrap in [[Greaseproof paper|greaseproof paper]] and tie with [[kitchen string]].\n| Wrap in a [[Tea-towel|tea-towel]] and press under a heavy weight for 24 hours.\n| The garage seemed the safest place to leave this, judging by the attention the cats were giving it!\n| I pressed the loaf between a plate and a cutting board, under a very heavy car tool-kit.\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe in slices\n===Variations===\nI'm thinking....\n===Chef's notes===\nA few comments after making this.  I have now halved the amount of meat originally used - go for quality, not quantity.  The taste was fantastic but there was too much meat and it was quite chewy unless sliced very thinly.\n\n[[Hammer the meat flat]] to reduce the thickness and also to tenderise it.\n\nUse the best quality steak you can afford.\n\nDon't worry about over-pressing it!  My pressing method was the tool-box pictured, almost full of car tools, spanners, hammers etc.  So heavy that it was almost not possible to lift it onto the workbench.  I checked it first thing in the morning, panicking and thinking it would like as flat as a tortilla.  It was not - it could easily have been left for another day.\n\n==Step by step photographs==\n===Making Duxelles===\n<gallery widths=270px heights=270px perrow=5>\nImage:Duxelles ingredients.jpg|The basic ingredients for [[duxelles]]\nImage:Shallots and garlic suateed in butter.jpg|[[Shallots]] and [[Garlic|garlic]] [[saut\u00e9ed]] in [[butter]]\nImage:Mushrooms chopped.jpg|Mushrooms chopped in the [[food processor]]\nImage:Mushrooms go in dry.jpg|The [[mushrooms]] look very dry when they are first added\nImage:White wine added.jpg|Wet again once the [[white wine]]/[[sherry]] is added\nImage:Duxelles reduced, ready to cool.jpg|[[Duxelles]] completed, ready to cool\n</gallery>\n===Assembling a Shooter's Sandwich===\n<gallery widths=270px heights=270px perrow=5>\nImage:Shooter's sandwich - Duxelles prepared and ready.jpg|Duxelles prepared and ready\nImage:Shooter's sandwich - Loaf separated and hollowed out.jpg|Loaf separated and hollowed out\nImage:Shooter's sandwich - First steak added.jpg|First steak added\nImage:Shooter's sandwich - Topped with duxelles.jpg|Topped with duxelles\nImage:Shooter's sandwich - Covered with the final steak.jpg|Covered with the final steak\nImage:Shooter's sandwich - Wrapped in grease-proof paper.jpg|Wrapped in grease-proof paper, tied with string\nImage:Shooter's sandwich - Pressed under a heavy weight.jpg|In the garage, away from the cats for 24 hours\nImage:Shooter's sandwich recipe.jpg|A Shooter's sandwich\n</gallery>\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Historic recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Beef recipes]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:Cooking with wine]]\n[[Category:Favourite recipes]]\n[[Category:Pan fried]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#shooterssandwich #duxelles #mushrooms #butter #shallots #thyme #garlic #steak #bread #beef #lemonjuice </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"

If you fill to the last basket market, that should be about right.\n| [[Bake]] for about 20 minutes.\n| Leave in the tin for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a [[Cooling rack|cooling rack]] and allow to go completely cold.\n| The sponges should have an interior texture of a cross between normal sponge [[Cake|cake]] and a nicely [[Baked|baked]] scone. Do not expect them to be like a Victoria [[Sandwich]] as that type of sponge won\u00c2\u2019t be strong enough to hold the filling.\n| When cold, reserve the sponges until ready for use. They can go into an [[Airtight container|airtight container]] in the [[Fridge|fridge]] if necessary.\n}}\n====For the Cr\u00e8me  Diplomate (This will probably make more than you need)====\n{{RecipeMethod\n| This is made in two parts \u2013 the Cr\u00e8me P\u00e2tissi\u00e8re and the Cr\u00e8me Chantilly \u2013 which are then mixed together. You can either make it a 'set' version or an 'unset' one. The 'set' one requires the use of [[Gelatine|gelatine]] to set the Cr\u00e8me P\u00e2tissi\u00e8re, but I chose to do the 'unset' one, being a [[Vegetarian|vegetarian]]. It may be possible to use [[Agar|agar]]-agar as a setting agent, but this will need some experimentation because agar behaves differently to gelatine. I would make the Cr\u00e8me P\u00e2tissi\u00e8re first as that need to cool.\n}}\n====For the Cr\u00e8me P\u00e2tissi\u00e8re ====\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Hydrate the [[Gelatine|gelatine]] (if using).\n| Beat the [[Egg yolks|egg yolks]] with the [[Sugar|sugar]].\n| Whisk in the [[Cornflour|cornflour]].\n| Bring the [[Milk|milk]] to the [[Boil|boil]] in a [[Saucepan|saucepan]], the pour half of the milk over the [[Egg|egg]] mixture.\n| Whisk, return to the [[Saucepan|saucepan]] and heat, whisking thoroughly.\n| As the mixture thickens, carry on whisking.\n| When it returns to the [[Boil|boil]], cook for 45 seconds and remove from the heat.\n| Whisk in the [[Gelatine|gelatine]] (if using) and the [[Butter|butter]].\n| Cover and leave to cool.\n}}\n====For the Cr\u00e8me Chantilly====\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Whisk all of the ingredients in a chilled bowl until it has thickened.\n| Do not over-whisk or you will end up with sweet [[Butter|butter]].\n| Cover the bowl and keep in the [[Fridge|fridge]] until needed.\n}}\n====To mix the two====\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Whisk the cold Cr\u00e8me P\u00e2tissi\u00e8re.\n| Whisk in one-third of the Cr\u00e8me Chantilly, until smooth.\n| Fold in the remaining [[Cream|cream]] with a [[Spatula|spatula]].\n| Store in an [[Airtight container|airtight container]] the [[Fridge|fridge]] until needed, although it is easier to work with if used immediately\n}}\n====Assembly====\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Fill the sponge cases with the Diplomat Cream \u2013 if you have made the unset version, just [[Pile|pile]] it in. For set version, you can use a [[Piping bag|piping bag]].\n| Arrange [[Cherries|cherries]] or [[Fruit|fruit]] of your choice on the [[Cream|cream]].\n| Sprinkle with a little [[Icing Sugar|icing sugar]].\n}}\n===Chef's notes===\nIt is likely that you will have some of the Diplomat Cream left over.  This can be [[Frozen|frozen]] and used in other recipes.\n\nIf using a fan [[Oven|oven]] which does not allow the fan to be switched off, do the following:\n\nOnce you have put the mixture into the moulds, wrap some [[Tin foil|tin foil]] around the [[Baking|baking]] in. The sponges need to be protected from the fan, but you don\u00c2\u2019t want the [[Foil|foil]] to touch them. I made a sort of tent over the top, which helped to keep it free of the mixture and if possible, enclose the whole [[Baking tin|baking tin]] with foil, so that the fan doesn\u00c2\u2019t dry up the sponges.\n\nPlace in a COLD [[Oven|oven]], below the middle, but not at the bottom.\n\nSwitch the [[Oven|oven]] on to 160C and [[Bake|bake]] for about 35 minutes (!).\n\nRemove the [[Foil|foil]] and check that they are cooked. If not they can go back in without the foil covering.\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:North American recipes]]\n[[Category:Bread and baking]]\n[[Category:Sweets and desserts]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes]]\n[[Category:Fruit recipes]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#butter #fridge #gelatine #icingsugar #boil #airtightcontainer #foil #cherries #castersugar #saucepan #cream </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"

Bring back to the boil, uncovered, for a short while to thicken when ready to serve.\n| Slice the silverside, reheat the [[Gravy|gravy]] and serve.\n}}\n===Chef's notes===\nI don't profess to be a pressure cooker expert, so 3 hours may be rather a long time to cook this joint-however, it was melt-in-the-mouth tender and almost all of the gelatinous tissues had melted away.  The meat still had plenty of flavour.\n\nThis fabulous recipe has lasted us for 5 days!  We have had it with [[jacket potatoes]] & vegetables, filled [[Yorkshire puddings]] and [[vegetables]], with [[homemade pasta]], with [[couscous]] and tonight, turned into [[Mexican meatballs]] in a [[Bolognaise Sauce (PC)|bolognaise sauce]] with [[spaghetti]].\n\nThe trick was to separate the gravy and the cooked meat as soon as the meat was cooked.  Because they were separately stored and refrigerated in [[Lock and Lock]]-style boxes, the meat could be carved and server with or without the gravy.\n==See also==\n* [[Slow cooked silverside of beef]] - A [[slow cooker]] version of this recipe.\n* [[Talk:Slow cooked silverside of beef|Notes made after cooking this recipe in a slow cooker]]\n* [[Slow roast recipes]]\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes|Beef silverside]]\n[[Category:British recipes|Beef silverside]]\n[[Category:Main courses|Beef silverside]]\n[[Category:Beef recipes|Beef silverside]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes|Beef silverside]]\n[[Category:Cooking with wine|Beef silverside]]\n[[Category:Favourite recipes|Beef silverside]]\n[[Category:Pressure cooker recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#pressurecooker #worcestershiresauce #jacketpotatoes #garlic #shiitakemushrooms #beefstock #beef #redwine #slowcooker #carrots #roasting </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"

Turn the oven down to 160\u00b0 C (325\u00b0 F - gas 3), [fan oven 140\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour] and add a little [[Boiling|boiling]] water to the roasting tin to stop the veggies from burning.

My silverside salmon cut(ish) joint was probably 4 inches thick at its widest and not much wider than the joint in the recipe at leat I am basing this roughly on the pics provided.  Rather than vacuum seal it I cooked it in a ziploc bag overnight. When i got up it had been cooking for 8 hours and had reached an internal temp of 58C.  I resealed the bag and cooked it for the extra 2 hours as advised. I got home a bit late, approx 30 mins.

'''Do not use your fingers at any point - severe burns can occur!!'''\n\nAlternatively, if you're handy with a pair of chopsticks, you can grip the end of the Spam with them and do the dipping and transferring that way.

If the resulting mixture is too wet, add a little more flour.\n| Store in a sealed container so it does not dry out and refrigerate whilst the pie filling slowly cooks.\n| After the filling has cooked for 3 hours, increase the oven temperature to 200\u00b0C (400\u00b0F - Gas\t6)\n| Check the suet mixture has not become too wet and correct using extra flour - the potatoes seem to release more moisture over time.\n| To prevent it sticking to the work surface, use [[yellow cornmeal]] if you have it, plain flour if not and roll out the [[suet]]. Carefully remove the tin-foil from the pie dish and and lay the crust on the pie filling.\n| [[Bake]] in the oven for 20 to 30 minutes until the [[suet]] crust has risen and is golden brown.\n}}\n===Chef's notes===\nIf you are pushed for time, you can cook this for less time at a higher temperature, however, the steak won't be as succulent and flavoursome.\n\nThe quick version: 220\u00b0 C (425\u00b0 F - Gas 7 - Hot) and follow the cooking instructions for [[Steak and kidney pie]] including the tin-foil tip.\n\nDon't be tempted to make the suet crust with a food processor, you will probably get a crust that does not rise.\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Beef recipes]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#suet #bakingpowder #parsley #flour #onion #beefstock #mustard #teviotpierecipe #worcestershiresauce #potatoes #potatodumpling </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"

There was enough left over to make a couple of pasties or a small quiche.  It is very difficult to specify how much pastry to make as it depends on the height of your tin and how thick you like your pastry.

You will probably need to use more than one tin, or use the tin's [[Roasting|roasting]] rack upon which you can make a second layer.\n| Put in the [[Freezer|freezer]] for at least 30 minutes.\n| Meanwhile, heat the [[Oil|oil]] to 130 C and remove the [[Chips|chips]] from the [[Freezer|freezer]].\n| Pat them dry again and [[Deep-fry|deep-fry]] in small batches until they look as if they are starting to change colour.  This could take 4 minutes or more.\n| Drain on [[Kitchen towel|kitchen towel]] and when they are all cooked, return the to the [[Roasting|roasting]] tin and [[Freeze|freeze]] again for a further 30 minutes, or overnight if desired.\n| About 20 minutes before you are ready to serve, reheat the [[Oil|oil]] to 190 C and cook the [[Chips|chips]] in batches again until golden (about 2 minutes or more).\n| Drain and serve.\n}}\n===Alternative method stages 1-3===\n# Drain the soaked [[Chips|chips]] and bring a pan of cold, unsalted water to the [[Boil|boil]], then add the [[chips]].\n# Reduce the heat and allow to simmer until almost cooked.\n# Immediately, remove from heat, drain, and place them on a [[cake rack]] to cool, then follow from stage 4 above.\n#Instead of boiling the [[Chips|chips]], you can place them in a microwave in a covered container with 110ml water and cook for 6 minutes.  This is for large [[Chips|chips]] using a 900 watt microwave.\n===Serving suggestions===\nWell, [[Chips|chips]] can go with most dishes, but can also be served with [[Garlic mayonnaise|garlic mayonnaise]], dips or [[Sauces|sauces]] as a snack.  You could sprinkle some [[Grated|grated]] melty [[Cheese|cheese]] over them, such as [[Emmental]], [[Queso Tetilla|Tetilla]], [[Mozzarella]] or [[Cheddar]].\n===Variations===\nThey can be made as thick or thin as you wish, but you will have to adjust the [[Cooking times|cooking times]] accordingly.\n===Chef's notes===\nIf you do not have a deep-[[Fat|fat]] fryer, then a large saucepan will be fine, but DO be careful not to fill it more than a third full with the [[Oil|oil]].  You will also need a [[thermometer]] to check the temperatures.\n===See also===\n{{SeeAlso-chips}}\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes|Chipped potatoes]]\n[[Category:Accompaniments|Chipped potatoes]]\n[[Category:British recipes|Chipped potatoes]]\n[[Category:Potato recipes|Chipped potatoes]]\n[[Category:Snacks and light bites|Chipped potatoes]]\n[[Category:Vegetable recipes|Chipped potatoes]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes|Chipped potatoes]]\n[[Category:Deep fried]][[Category:Boiled or simmered]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#chips #roasting #thricecookedchippedpotatoes #freezer #boil #kitchentowel #cakerack #emmental #starch #greaseproofpaper #boiledorsimmered </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
