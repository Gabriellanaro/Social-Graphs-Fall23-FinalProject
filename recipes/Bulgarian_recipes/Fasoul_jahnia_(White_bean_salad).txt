Raw, de-seeded and chopped and stirred in just before serving.\n===Chef's notes===\nAfter the first hour of boiling, the beans had already started to disintegrate so I only boiled the second stage for as long as it takes to cook the carrots (30 minutes).\n\nThis time of year almost all my fresh [[herbs]] are gone, so I have added a few fresh [[bay leaves]] at the second boiling stage to add a ''herby'' flavour.\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes|Fasoul jahnia (white bean salad)]]\n[[Category:Accompaniments|Fasoul jahnia (white bean salad)]]\n[[Category:Bulgarian recipes|Fasoul jahnia (white bean salad)]]\n[[Category:Grain and bean recipes|Fasoul jahnia (white bean salad)]]\n[[Category:Salad recipes|Fasoul jahnia (white bean salad)]]\n[[Category:Snacks and light bites|Fasoul jahnia (white bean salad)]]\n[[Category:Vegetable recipes|Fasoul jahnia (white bean salad)]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes|Fasoul jahnia (white bean salad)]]\n[[Category:Boiled or simmered]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#herbs #garlic #boil #lemonjuice #diced #dill #salad #haricotbeans #lemon #savory #thyme </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
