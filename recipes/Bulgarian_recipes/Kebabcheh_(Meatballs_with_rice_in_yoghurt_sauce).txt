Don't rinse this rice.\n| 150 ml [[Yoghurt|yogurt]] beaten with 2 [[Egg yolks|egg yolks]]\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Mix the first 6 ingredients in a bowl and knead until smooth.\n| Divide the mixture into 20, and with wet hands, shape each piece into a small ball.\n| Pour the [[Stock|stock]] into a large saucepan and bring to the [[Boil|boil]].\n| Reduce the heat, gently add the [[Meatballs|meatballs]], cover and [[Simmer|simmer]] for 15 minutes.\n| Carefully stir in the [[Rice|rice]] and [[Simmer|simmer]] for a further 20 minutes.\n| Remove the [[Meatballs|meatballs]] from the pan and  keep warm in a serving dish.\n| Reduce the heat under the pan to the lowest setting and gradually stir in the [[Yoghurt|yogurt]] and [[Egg|egg]] mixture.\n| Stir continuously until the [[Sauce|sauce]] thickens, without allowing it to [[Boil|boil]].\n| Pour the [[Sauce|sauce]] over the [[Meatballs|meatballs]] and serve immediately.\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe with [[pilav rice]] and [[Salad|salad]].\n\nThis is delicious and will be made again.  It's quite rich and creamy and I think would be nice with a few cold sliced tomatoes and some [[roasted sweet peppers]] or perhaps a [[Tomato and onion salad]].  Wedges of lemon would be nice too.\n===Variations===\nIf you wish, add [[Garlic|garlic]] and substitute the [[Marjoram|marjoram]] for [[Oregano|oregano]] or other [[Herbs|herbs]].\n===Chef's notes===\nIf like me, you can't bring yourself to add a whole teaspoon of salt to any recipe, just add what you are comfortable using, or none!\n\nI guess the idea of the rice is to thicken the sauce.  If you also find that fails, try the following; it worked fine for me:\n\nBefore adding the [[yogurt]], add a teaspoon of [[arrowroot]] or [[cornflour]] to a saucer, add a tablespoon of the sauce and mix until combined, add this back to the sauce and heat until thickened. Leave to cool for a few minutes or the [[yogurt]] will [[Splitting cream|split]].  Stir in the [[yogurt]] and continue the recipe.\n===Serving suggestions===\nThis went really well with [[couscous]] and [[Fennel, red onion and orange salad|fennel, red onion and orange salad]].\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes|Kebabcheh (meatballs with rice in yogurt sauce)]]\n[[Category:Beef recipes|Kebabcheh (meatballs with rice in yogurt sauce)]]\n[[Category:Bulgarian recipes|Kebabcheh (meatballs with rice in yogurt sauce)]]\n[[Category:Lamb recipes|Kebabcheh (meatballs with rice in yogurt sauce)]]\n[[Category:Main courses|Kebabcheh (meatballs with rice in yogurt sauce)]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes|Kebabcheh (meatballs with rice in yogurt sauce)]]\n[[Category:Rice recipes|Kebabcheh (meatballs with rice in yogurt sauce)]]\n[[Category:Favourite recipes|Kebabcheh (meatballs with rice in yogurt sauce)]]\n[[Category:Boiled or simmered]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#yogurt #meatballs #egg #sauce #yoghurt #simmer #boil #lamb #marjoram #oregano #breadcrumbs </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
