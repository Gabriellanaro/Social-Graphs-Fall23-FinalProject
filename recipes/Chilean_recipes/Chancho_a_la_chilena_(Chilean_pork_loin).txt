I have used fresh herbs where possible and have roughly chopped the vegetables as they won't be eaten afterwards.  I used about the identical quantities, topping up with water to cover. This version was cooked for 1 hour and took 3 more hours to cool. --[[User:Chef|Chef]] 15:13, 10 October 2010 (BST)\n===Chef's notes===\n{{Template:ThinkPig}}\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes|Chancho a la chilena (chilean pork loin)]]\n[[Category:Chilean recipes|Chancho a la chilena (chilean pork loin)]]\n[[Category:Latin American recipes|Chancho a la chilena (chilean pork loin)]]\n[[Category:Main courses|Chancho a la chilena (chilean pork loin)]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes|Chancho a la chilena (chilean pork loin)]]\n[[Category:Pork recipes|Chancho a la chilena (chilean pork loin)]]\n[[Category:Boiled or simmered]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#porkloin #pork #boil #stock #redwinevinegar #sauce #celery #carrot #groundcumin #bayleaf #chile </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
