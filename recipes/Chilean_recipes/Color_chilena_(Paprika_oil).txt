If you only wish to make a little of this oil, work on the basis that you will need 1 teaspoon of [[paprika]] to 2 tablespoons of [[oil]].  You end up with less [[oil]] than you started with as the [[paprika]] absorbs a lot of it and the [[oil]] is poured into the bottle leaving the [[paprika]] behind.\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes|Color chilena (paprika oil)]]\n[[Category:Chilean recipes|Color chilena (paprika oil)]]\n[[Category:Latin American recipes|Color chilena (paprika oil)]]\n[[Category:Marinades dressings and butters|Color chilena (paprika oil)]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes|Color chilena (paprika oil)]]\n[[Category:Boiled or simmered]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#paprika #lard #garlic #bitter #vegetableoil #unusualrecipes </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
