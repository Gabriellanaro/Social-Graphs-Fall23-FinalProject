I decided to make a [[Pickle|pickle]] with what was left.\n\nMost of the flavour of a [[Pickle|pickle]] is from the [[Vinegar|vinegar]] plus any additional [[Spices|spices]].  I absolutely love the flavour of Chinkiang [[Black vinegar|black vinegar]], it's so nice you could almost [[Drink|drink]] it.  As I want to retain the flavour of the Chinkiang black rice vinegar and not sully it with any other flavours, I'm using just the vinegar and the [[Cauliflower|cauliflower]].\n\nTo hold all of the pieces of [[cauliflower]] under the vinegar and prevent them from going mouldy, I used an odd piece of sterilised plastic to cover them.  If you are going to do this only use plastic as most metals will corrode in the vinegar.  Some commercial pickles actually come with a plastic disc that performs this function that you might be able to reuse.\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| 500 g of small [[Cauliflower|cauliflower]] florets trimmed from a cauliflower\n| 2 tablespoons fine [[Salt|salt]]\n| 3 550 ml bottles of Chinkiang [[Black vinegar|black vinegar]]\n}}\n\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| Add the [[Cauliflower|cauliflower]] florets to a bowl and just cover with cold water\n| Leave in a cool place for 24 hours.\n| RInse the florets in cold water and dry, ideally using a [[Salad spinner|salad spinner]]\n| Lay the florets out on a [[Tea towel|tea towel]], ideally in the sun or in a [[Warm place|warm place]] for a few hours\n| [[Sterilise]] a [[Kilner jar]], add the [[Cauliflower|cauliflower]] florets and cover with Chinkiang [[Black vinegar|black vinegar]]\n| Leave for 1 month to mature\n}}\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Chinkiang black vinegar.jpg|300px|thumb|right|Chinkiang black vinegar (\u00a31.43 per 550ml [[See Woo]] May 2015)\nImage:Very large cauliflower.jpg|300px|thumb|right|A very large cauliflower!\n</gallery>\n\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Chinese recipes]]\n[[Category:Accompaniments]]\n[[Category:Pickles and preserves]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n[[Category:Pickled]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#cauliflower #blackvinegar #chinesestylepickledcauliflower #pickle #saladspinner #vinegar #spices #teatowel #sterilise #seewoo #frozen </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
