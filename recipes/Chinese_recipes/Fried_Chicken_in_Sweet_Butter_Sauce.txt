I usually leave them overnight.\n| Heat the [[Oil|oil]], pat the [[Chicken|chicken]] pieces dry and and [[Fry|fry]] chicken until they are golden, drain on kitchen paper and set to one side.\n| Saut\u00e9 the [[Garlic|garlic]] and [[Onion|onion]] for a a few minutes, then add the remaining [[Sauce|sauce]] ingredients.\n| [[Stir fry]] for a minute and then add [[Chicken|chicken]] pieces to reheat.\n| Serve with [[Plain boiled rice|plain boiled rice]], garnished with slices of [[Lime|lime]].\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe with [[Plain boiled rice]], Slices of [[Lime|lime]] and a few chopped [[spring onions]].\n\n===Variations===\nFor a more authentic recipe:\n* Use [[Chinese cooking]] [[Wine|wine]] instead of [[Dry sherry|dry sherry]]\n* Use 8 tbsp Indonesian sweet soy sauce, [[kecap manis]] instead of [[dark soy sauce]] & [[molasses]].\n===Chef's notes===\nFor health reasons, I try to avoid frying whenever I can especially when there is already so much butter as in this recipe.  As a healthy alternative, I sprayed the chicken pieces with a little olive oil and roasted them for about 35 minutes at 220\u00b0C (425\u00b0, Gas 7).  They tasted just as nice!\n==See also==\n* {{See also - Jointing a chicken}} \n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Chinese recipes]]\n[[Category:Oriental cuisine]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Garlic recipes]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:Poultry recipes]]\n[[Category:Pan fried]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#friedchickeninsweetbuttersauce #chicken #zest #lime #onion #drysherry #darksoysauce #molasses #juice #garlic #plainboiledrice </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
