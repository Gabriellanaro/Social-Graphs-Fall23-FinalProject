And so typical of [[Sichuan cuisine|sichuan cuisine]].\n\nI used to live in Beijing for 2.5 years. In this time I absolutely fell in love with [[Chinese cuisine]], but sichuan cuisine in particular. And the sichuan [[Peppercorn|peppercorn]] is largely responsible for that. I just love the tingly, numbing, citrusy, sharp taste.''\n\n''So I was delighted to discover this homemade [[Chili oil|chili oil]]. To me, it's simply Sichuan in a Bottle.\"''\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 6 tablespoons [[Sichuan peppercorns|sichuan peppercorns]] (pictured)\n| 8 tablespoons [[Chili flakes|chili flakes]] (ready bought or chop some [[Dried chillies|dried chillies]] yourself)\n| 1 teaspoon [[Salt|salt]]\n| 1 tablespoon [[Sesame oil|sesame oil]]\n| 360 ml [[Peanut oil|peanut oil]]\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Put everything except the [[Oil|oil]] in a heat proof container.\n| Heat [[Oil|oil]] between 107 to 122.5 [[Degrees|degrees]] [[Celsius]] and pour over the other ingredients. Be careful because it will sizzle. (Or actually, when you have a [[Thermometer|thermometer]], like I do, you will notice it won't sizzle at all. If you don't, then yes, be careful)\n| Leave to cool down. After the flavours have blended for a day you can [[Sieve|sieve]] the [[Oil|oil]], if you wish. \n|Store in your [[Refrigerator|refrigerator]] for a couple of weeks.\n}}\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Szechuan chilli oil - heated.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Heating the chillies and peppercorns\nImage:Szechuan chilli oil - cold.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Opaque when taken from the fridge\n</gallery>\n===Robin's notes===\nFunny thing is that with my version it always \u201csets\u201d.\n\nWhen I take it out of the fridge it will become nice and translucent again, but cold it looks like this.\n\nI\u2019m quite sure it doesn\u2019t make any difference to the taste, but if anybody knows why this happens, please tell me!
