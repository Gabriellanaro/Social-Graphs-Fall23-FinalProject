You'll probably pay double and certainly won't have the selection of ingredients that you'll have if you follow my next suggestion.\n===Buy the ingredients from the same place as your Chinese take-away does===\n''This advice is specific to the United Kingdom, though I'm sure similar outlets exist throughout the world''.\n\nPay a visit to your local [[Chinese food wholesaler]].  There are chains of them throughout the UK and you don't need to be a member of any trade association to buy from them.  You may find them a little intimidating at first, but the staff are friendly and if you are into your food in a big way, you will find it a fascinating experience.  Most of them have a very good online presence so you can 'look before you buy'.  I guarantee that you will go back again and again.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 800g frozen pre cooked aromatic crispy duck [\u00a39.50]\n| 1 multi-pack 'pancakes for crispy duck' [ 102 pancakes, 17 packs (pre-packed in packs of 6) ]\n| 1 [[cucumber]]\n| 1 bunch [[spring onions]]\n| 50g 'Sauce for Peking Duck'\n\n}}\n\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n* Defrost a few packets of [[Chinese pancakes]]\n* Peel the [[cucumber]], quarter lengthwise and run a sharp knife along each quadrant to remove most of the seeds.\n* Top and tail the [[spring onions]]\n* Using a [[food processor]] with a metal blade, slice the [[cucumber]] and [[spring onions]].  It doesn't look as neat as [[julienning]] them, but it takes a quarter of the time and tastes just as good.\n* Chill the [[spring onions]] and [[cucumber]] in the [[refrigerator]] while the [[duck]] defrosts\n* Preheat the oven to 200\u00b0 C (400\u00b0 F - gas 6)\n\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Place the [[duck]] (skin-side down) on a rack over a [[roasting tray]] or a [[perforated roasting tray]] over a [[roasting tray]] - this will allow for the fat to drain off whilst the [[duck]] cooks.\n| Roast the [[duck]] for 45 minutes, turning once, carefully draining the roasting tray if it fills with [[fat]], otherwise you'll have a very smoky kitchen\n| You can [[steam]] the pancakes in a [[Chinese steamer]] over a [[wok]] or pan of boiling water for a few minutes - they only need to be warmed, not cooked.  I find they often stick together warming them this way so I prefer to separate the pancakes, spread them out on a large plate and [[microwave]] them for a minute or two to warm them.\n| Remove the [[duck]] from the oven, chop the skin into bite-sized pieces and then with two forks pulling against each other, shred the duck meat.\n}}\n===To serve===\nSpread a little of your favourite sauce on a pancake, cover with cucumber, spring onions & duck, roll the pancake up and eat with your fingers - delicious!\n===Variations===\nTry other sauces: [[Hoisin sauce]], [[Plum sauce]], [[chilli sauce]] and even [[mayonaise]] works very well!\n\nSliced white [[onions]] are a nice addition to [[spring onions]].\n\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes|Duck]]\n[[Category:Favourite recipes|Duck]]\n[[Category:Chinese recipes|Duck]]\n[[Category:Poultry recipes|Duck]]\n[[Category:Oriental cuisine|Duck]]\n[[Category:Main courses|Duck]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes|Duck]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n[[Category:Steamed]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#cucumber #springonions #duck #howtomakecrispyaromaticduckathome #foodprocessor #roastingtray #microwave #cheat #chinesepancakes #miseenplace #unusualrecipes </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"

I thought I would try a similar recipe using sous vide cooking and using everyday ingredients as some of the Japanese ingredients can be difficult to find.  I also wanted to experiment with this sous vide recipe using relatively  economic silverside of [[Beef|beef]] rather than beef fillet.\n\nI've used Chardonnay instead of [[Mirin]], not a great substitute but I always have some Chardonnay in the freezer in paper cups.  Dead easy to scoop a spoonful out when needed for cooking, and it saves having to drink the dreadful stuff! [[Light soy sauce|light soy sauce]] is pretty close to [[shoyo]].  I use [[Frozen ginger paste]] which is almost as good as the real thing.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| 700g [1lb 8 oz] [[Beef|beef]] silverside joint, trimmed of excess [[Fat|fat]]\n| 1 tablespoon [[White wine|white wine]]\n| 2 tablespoons of [[Light soy sauce|light soy sauce]]\n| 1 teaspoon [[Grated|grated]] [[Ginger|ginger]] (thumb sized piece of ginger, peeled and grated)\n| 1/4 of a teaspoon [[Szechuan peppercorns|szechuan peppercorns]] crushed in a [[Pestle and mortar|pestle and mortar]]\n| 1 tablespoon of [[fine yellow cornmeal]] to thicken the gravy, optional.\n}}\n\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n\n* Stamp the joint all over with a [[meat tenderiser]] tool. This helps to tenderize the joint and also allow the [[Marinade|marinade]] to permeate the meat.\n\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| When selecting the size of pouch to contain the [[Beef|beef]], make one that is quite a bit larger than the joint.  This seems to make it easier to seal without drawing all the [[Marinade|marinade]] into the [[Vacuum sealer|vacuum sealer]].\n| Being careful not to wet the inner edges of the bag where it will be sealed, add all of the ingredients, apart from the cornmeal to the vacuum bag.\n| Set the [[Vacuum sealer|vacuum sealer]] so the bag can hang vertically over the edge of the work surface.\n| Press the [[Vacuum seal|vacuum seal]] button on your sealer and then cancel just as any liquid begins to be drawn into the sealing chamber.  Then press heat seal to seal the bag.  The pessimist in me always seals the bag a couple of times at each end, just in case!\n| Sous vide cook at 68\u00b0C (''154.4\u00b0F'') for 12 hours for medium - well done.  See [[Sous vide cooking times]] for other levels of doneness.\n| If you want to thicken the gravy, immediately the 12 hours cooking is complete, add the juices to a hot pan together with a tablespoon of [[fine yellow cornmeal]], bring to a simmer, stirring all the while.\n| Carve and serve.\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe with [[Potatoes|potatoes]] and a [[Vegetable|vegetable]] of your choice.\n===Chef's notes===\nThis was fantastic, the meat was so tender and juicy that it didn't really need any gravy.  I've now reduced the quantity of the [[szechuan peppercorns]] as they were a little overpowering.  Any strong flavours multiply when cooking in a vac packed bag.\n\nI've not found any benefit to resting meat when cooking [[sous vide]] and in this instance I did not sear the outside of the meat as it looked great with all the peppercorns around the edge.\n{{SousVideSeeAlso}}\n{{Template:PeelingGinger}}\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Chinese recipes]]\n[[Category:Oriental cuisine]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Beef recipes]]\n[[Category:Cooking with wine]]\n[[Category:Sous vide recipes]]\n[[Category:Sous vide cooking]]\n[[Category:Favourite recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#beef #szechuanpeppercorns #orientalsousvidesilversidebeef #vacuumsealer #marinade #fineyellowcornmeal #lightsoysauce #shoyo #pestleandmortar #shoyubeef #fat </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
