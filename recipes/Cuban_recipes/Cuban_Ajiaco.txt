Then combine [[Chicken stock|chicken stock]], [[Chicken breast|chicken breast]], [[Onion|onion]], [[Bay leaves|bay leaves]] and [[Potatoes|potatoes]] in a large saucepot or [[Dutch Oven|dutch oven]]. Add more water if necessary to cover solids by 1-inch. Bring to a [[Boil|boil]] over high heat. Reduce to a [[Simmer|simmer]] and cook until [[Chicken|chicken]] breast is cooked through, about 10 minutes. Transfer [[Chicken|chicken]] breast to plate and set aside until cooled to room temperature.\n| Continue to [[Simmer|simmer]] [[Potatoes|potatoes]] until completely tender and falling apart, about 45 minutes longer, adding more water as necessary. Discard [[Onion|onion]] and [[Bay leaves|bay leaves]]. Using whisk, [[Mash|mash]] [[Potato|potato]] pieces against side of pot and stir vigorously to thicken [[Soup|soup]]. The [[Soup|soup]] should be thick, with large chunks of [[Potatoes|potatoes]] still remaining.\n| Add [[Corn|corn]] cobs and continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until [[Corn|corn]] is cooked and [[Soup|soup]] is thickened to the consistency of thick [[Heavy cream|heavy cream]], about 15 minutes longer. Remove from heat.\n| While [[Soup|soup]] is cooking, make the aji: Combine [[Onion|onion]], [[Cilantro|cilantro]], and [[Chile pepper|chile pepper]] in small serving bowl and add water until just covered. Season generously with [[Salt|salt]] and stir to combine. Set aside. Discard [[Chicken|chicken]] skin and [[bones]]. Shred [[Meat|meat]] into bite-size pieces and set aside in serving bowl.\n| Season [[Soup|soup]] to taste with [[Salt|salt]] and [[Pepper|pepper]]. Serve immediately, passing picked [[Chicken|chicken]], chopped [[Capers|capers]], [[Sour cream|sour cream]], and aji table-side for diners to add to their bowl. Serve [[Avocado|avocado]] slices on the side. Add Goya Sazon Tipico for a savoury kick,\n| Find all the [[Cuban]] ingredients you need for your [[Caribbean]] recipes at [[Cuban Cuisine]].\n}}\n===Recipe source===\n\n*  {{RecipeCourtesyOfCubanCuisine}}\n==See also==\n\n* [http://www.cubancuisine.co.uk www.cubancuisine.co.uk]\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Cuban recipes]]\n[[Category:Slow cooker recipes]]\n[[Category:Stews and casseroles]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#potatoes #onion #soup #chicken #chickenbreast #bayleaves #corn #chickenstock #cubanajiaco #avocado #split </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
