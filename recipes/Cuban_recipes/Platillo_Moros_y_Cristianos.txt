It is also found in Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic, and expatriate communities of each of these cultures. It was introduced during the Nicaraguan Sandinista regime when both countries mixed culturally because of strong ties. The dish also takes after the name '''gallo pinto''', used in Nicaragua and Costa Rica. \n[[Image:Gallo pinto.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Gallo pinto, 'painted rooster']]\n\nThe \"Moors\" refer to the [[Black beans|black beans]], and \"Christians\" to the white [[Rice|rice]] - a reference to the early settlers of Cuba for whom the Reconquista of Spain was a recent memory.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 600 g [[Rice|rice]]\n| 200 g [[Black beans|black beans]]\n| 3 sprigs [[Thyme|thyme]]\n| 2 tablespoons chopped [[Coriander leaves|coriander leaves]] and stems\n| 1 whole [[Coconut|coconut]], meat removed and finely grated.\n| A pinch of [[Salt|salt]]\n| 2 [[Cloves garlic, peeled and crushed|cloves garlic, peeled and crushed]]\n| 3 [[Spring onions|spring onions]]\n| &frac14; teaspoon [[Ground black pepper|ground black pepper]]\n| 2 [[Pints|pints]] hot water\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Soak [[Beans|beans]] overnight, rinse and drain thoroughly\n| Add two cups of the water the beans were soaked in to the [[Coconut|coconut]] and squeeze through a [[Sieve|sieve]].
