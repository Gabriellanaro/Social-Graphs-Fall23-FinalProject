The timing for this is not exact, but the longer you boil the darker the [[Caramel|caramel]] becomes. \n* Do not open until several hours later when the can has cooled sufficiently. \n* It is best to [[Boil|boil]] it the day before you want to use it. This process caramelises the [[Milk|milk]].\n\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| Place the [[Icing Sugar|icing sugar]], [[Butter|butter]], [[Egg|egg]] and [[Honey|honey]] in a heatproof bowl over gently [[Simmering|simmering]] water. \n| Stir until the ingredients are well combined and warm. \n| Remove from the heat, beat in the [[Bicarbonate of soda|bicarbonate of soda]] and [[Plain flour|plain flour]] to form a firm [[Dough|dough]].\n| Set aside to cool and firm up for 30 minutes. At this point it should be a nice [[biscuit]] [[Dough|dough]] consistency and you should be able to roll it out onto [[Parchment paper|parchment paper]] without it sticking.\n| Preheat the [[Oven|oven]] to 200\u00b0 C (400\u00b0 F - gas 6), [fan oven 180\u00b0 C]\n| Take the [[Dough|dough]], and divide into 6 even pieces. \n| Roll out each piece into a thin round - use a 15cm round tin as a guide for this.\n| When you have your six rounds, put on a [[Baking sheet|baking sheet]] and place in the preheated [[Oven|oven]] for 4-5 minutes. You need to keep a close eye while these are cooking - we want firm discs, with a pale golden colour.\n| Once you have the [[Caramelised|caramelised]] [[Milk|milk]], [[Blend|blend]] it with the [[Butter|butter]] until creamy. This will be used between the layers and to coat the [[Cake|cake]].\n| Take a disc of sponge, cover generously with [[Rum|rum]] and [[Coffee|coffee]] mixture using a [[Pastry|pastry]] [[Brush|brush]] then cover with [[Cream|cream]].\n| Place the next sponge disc on top, and repeat until you have added all 6 layers, press the layers gently down as you go.\n| Cover the whole [[Cake|cake]] with the [[Caramel|caramel]] [[Cream|cream]] and then sprinkle with the [[Ground|ground]] and chopped [[Nuts|nuts]].\n| Place in the [[Fridge|fridge]] for a least 6 hours or best overnight to set and allow the [[Cream|cream]] to soak into the sponge discs.\n}}\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes|Honey cake]]\n[[Category:Czech recipes|Honey cake]]\n[[Category:Russian recipes|Honey cake]]\n[[Category:Bread and baking|Honey cake]]\n[[Category:Sweets and desserts|Honey cake]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes|Honey cake]]\n[[Category:Cooking with wine|Honey cake]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted|Honey cake]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#cake #dough #butter #cream #boil #condensedmilk #caramel #ground #icingsugar #egg #walnuts </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
