If you want tasty flavourful [[Gammon|gammon]] that can be 'carved' by pushing a spoon on to it, then the answer is simple: 1 hour at full pressure and allow the [[Pressure cooker|pressure cooker]] to depressurise naturally.\n\nThis simple formula works for most [[Gammon|gammon]] joints between 1kg & 1.8kg; the standard size for rolled gammon.\n\nIf your joint is smaller, cook it for 45 minutes.  That's the answer!\n\nTo add a little extra flavour I've used some [[Citrus fruits|citrus fruits]] and [[Herbs|herbs]].  It was delicious, moist and extremely tasty!\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| 1.6 kg rolled [[Gammon joint|gammon joint]], rind removed\n| 2 [[Oranges|oranges]]\n| 1 [[Grapefruit|grapefruit]]\n| Big bunch of [[Sage|sage]]\n| Sprig of [[Thyme|thyme]]\n| Good pinch of [[Freshly ground black pepper|freshly ground black pepper]]\n}}\n\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| Put the [[Fresh herbs|fresh herbs]] into the [[Cooker|cooker]].\n| Put the pot stand in the [[Pressure cooker|pressure cooker]] and fill with a couple of inches of hot water, so the inner pot is just above the water level.\n| Cut the [[Grapefruit|grapefruit]] into enough slices to line the base of the inner pot.\n| Remove all of the plastic wrapping from the [[Gammon joint|gammon joint]], if applicable.\n| Sit the joint on top of the [[Grapefruit|grapefruit]] slices.\n| Cut the [[Oranges|oranges]] into halves and surround the [[Gammon|gammon]] with them.\n| Sprinkle everything with a good amount of [[Black pepper|black pepper]].\n| Close the [[Pressure cooker|pressure cooker]], bring to full pressure and cook for one hour.\n| Allow to depressurise naturally.\n}}\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Bunch_of_herbs_in_pressure_cooker.jpg|Put a big bunch of herbs in the base of the pressure cooker\nImage:Gammon_joint_on_grapefruit_slices.jpg|Sit the gammon joint on slices of grapefruit\nImage:Cooking gammon in a pressure cooker recipe.jpg|Surround the gammon joint with citrus fruit\nImage:Gammon_joint_pressure_cooked_in_one_hour.jpg|Pressure cooked ham cooking for one hour\nImage:The_gammon_falls_apart_after_cooking.jpg|The joint of gammon just falls apart; perfectly cooked\nImage:Pressure_cooked_gammon.jpg|Perfectly cooked in 1 hour, tender and juicy and carved with a spoon!\n</gallery>\n\n===Serving suggestions===\nGreat as a '[[Roast|roast]]' dinner, and fantastic served cold, as a [[Salad|salad]].\n===Variations===\nI noticed that black pepper sprinkled over the gammon joint at the start of cooking remained until the very end.  On that basis, it would be pefectly possible to roll the ham joint in flavourings before cooking which would give you a lovely flavoured outside.  Will try this soon!\n===Chef's notes===\nNote to self: With this amount of water, electric hob setting 9 is fine to bring to pressure without burning the contents.

Gravlax is usually served as an [[appetiser]], sliced thinly and accompanied by hovm\u00e4stars\u00e5s (also known as gravlaxs\u00e5s), a dill and mustard sauce, either on bread of some kind, or with [[boiled potatoes]].\n\nWhen I first made this and tasted it, I didn't like the taste and thought it rather odd.  Over the next few days I had the odd nibble and started to change my mind, by the end of 1 week I was waking up in the middle of the night, sneaking down to the fridge for another slice.  Do try this, it's brilliant!\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 450 g [[Salmon fillets|salmon fillets]] (see Chef's notes)\n| 2 tablespoons [[Sea Salt|sea salt]]\n| 2 tablespoons [[Caster sugar|caster sugar]]\n| 2 teaspoons [[Black peppercorns|black peppercorns]], freshly [[Ground|ground]]\n| 2 teaspoons [[Juniper berries|juniper berries]], crushed in a [[Pestle and mortar|pestle and mortar]] \n| A really big handful of fresh [[Dill|dill]]\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Discovering by touch, remove all [[bones]] from the fillet - folding it over and using a clean pair of pliers or [[tweezers]] to pull out  the really obstinate ones.  The [[bones]] are in a symmetrical pattern, so once you have found one, check the other side for its matching pair. \n| Mix the [[Salt|salt]], [[Sugar|sugar]], [[Peppercorns|peppercorns]] and [[Juniper|juniper]] in a bowl\n| Treating each fillet individually, cut a sheet of plastic-wrap about 3 times the size of the fillet and lay the fillet skin-side down in the centre of the plastic-wrap.\n| Sprinkle the mixture over the fillet ensuring that you caver every part of the flesh.\n| Now lay the sprigs of [[Dill|dill]] on the top of the fillet.  Using whole sprigs, folded over, makes it easier to remove when we discard it at the finish.\n| Wrap the [[Salmon|salmon]] tightly in the plastic-wrap and finish by wrapping in another layer of plastic.\n| Place the fillet in a container to catch any escaping juices and [[Refrigerate|refrigerate]] for three days.  Turn daily and drain any liquid that has escaped.\n| After 3 days, unwrap, discard the [[Dill|dill]] and quickly rinse under cold water to remove all trace of the mixture.\n| Pat dry with paper towels\n}}\n===Servings===\nServes 6 - Enough for 450g (1 lb) of [[Salmon fillets|salmon fillets]]\n===Serving suggestions===\nSlice very thinly at a 30\u00b0 angle to the fillet\nServe on toast, [[Crackers|crackers]], [[Crispbread|crispbread]] etc.  A squeeze of [[Lemon juice|lemon juice]] is the only extra that you are likely to need.\n===Chef's notes===\nUse [[Salmon fillets|salmon fillets]] (eg: thin) with the flesh cut parallel to the backbone, not [[Salmon steaks|salmon steaks]] (eg: thick) with the flesh cut down into the backbone.\n\nIgnoring the above, I used 1 (375 g) salmon steak, sliced in half lengthwise, see picture. A mean, 'supermarket-sized' bunch of dill is just enough for this steak and the two combined will be a great way to try this recipe out.  Bart spices now do juniper berries in small spice bottles, so hunt them out in the spices section.\n\nThere seems to be varying opinions as top whether the steaks should be weighed down.  I have to say that from my experience of [[curing bacon]], weights enable more liquid to be drawn off without using excess [[salt]], so I'm in that camp!  I've used non-metallic objects to exert an even pressure when the lid is closed, Weighed down between two plates would work fine, but you will have a fishy fridge that way.\n\nHaving made it, I would now be inclined to carefully slice the skin off before processing so the flavour can properly penetrate both side of the fillet.\n===Step by step images===\n<gallery widths=200px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Gravlax, removing pin [[bones]] with pliers.jpg|Removing the pin-[[bones]] with pliers\nImage:Gravlax, steak cut in half.jpg|The steak, sliced in half, lengthwise\nImage:Gravlax, cover with the cure.jpg|Cover both sides of the fillet with the cure\nImage:Gravlax, lay the dill weed on top.jpg|Lay the dill evenly on top\nImage:Gravlax, wrapped and placed in a lock and lock box.jpg|Wrapped in cling-film and placed in a lock and lock box\nImage:Gravlax, use a non-metallic object to exert pressure.jpg|Using non-metallic objects to exert pressure when the lid is closed\nImage:Gravlax, Dated and ready for 3 days refrigeration.jpg|Dated and ready for 3 days refrigeration\nImage:Gravlax, sliced.jpg|My first attempt, after 4 days processing - success!\n</gallery>\nI combined my first gravlax with [[spaghetti]], [[cream cheese]] and [[sour cream]] to make [[Gravlax spaghetti cream|this amazing recipe]].\n===Variations===\nTry your gravlax in a [[Smoked salmon pancake stack]]!\n===See also===\n* [[Gravlax spaghetti cream|Gravlax spaghetti cream recipe]]\n* [[Smoked salmon and crayfish parcels|Gravlax and crayfish parcels]]\n\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Danish recipes]]\n[[Category:Norwegian recipes]]\n[[Category:Fish recipes]]\n[[Category:Freshwater fish recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Marinades dressings and butters]]\n[[Category:Salad recipes]]\n[[Category:Sea fish recipes]]\n[[Category:Finnish recipes]]\n[[Category:Snacks and light bites]]\n[[Category:Starters]]\n[[Category:Swedish recipes]]\n[[Category:Ingredients]]\n[[Category:Fish and seafood]]\n[[Category:Prepared foods]]\n[[Category:Uncooked]][[Category:Pickled]]\n{{CategoryLineIngredients}}\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#gravlax #dill #bones #salmonfillets #salmon #castersugar #juniper #spaghetti #refrigerate #pickled #crispbread </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"

Chill in the [[Refrigerator|refrigerator]] for at least 30 minutes to firm up.\n| Turn the timbales out onto serving plates, surround with  swirl of [[Sour cream|sour cream]] and sprinkle with [[Dill|dill]].\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe with [[Brown bread|brown bread]] and [[Butter|butter]].\n===Variations===\nTry [[Tabasco]] or [[Louisiana Hot Pepper Sauce|Louisiana hot pepper sauce]] instead of  [[Worcestershire sauce]].\n===Chef's notes===\nI have made plenty of changes from the original recipe:\n\nBecause almost every ingredient in this recipe is so high in [[cholesterol]] I decided to omit the [[soured cream]] as a garnish altogether. I also reduced the size of the [[timbales]] by using a silicone muffin tray instead of [[ramekin dishes]].  This made more, smaller timbales.\n\nBecause of the astronomical cost cost of sliced [[smoked salmon]], I used 100 g of sliced [[smoked salmon]] and 120 g of smoked salmon trimmings (87p!) - these I sliced thinly and chopped with a very sharp knife.\n\nAs the [[avocado]] was not as ripe as it could have been, I mixed everything in a food processor with a sharp blade.  This whipped the cream, chopped the [[avocado]] to mush and mixed it up rather well.\n\nAfter 6 'muffins' there was still a some filling and some smoked salmon trimmings left over.  These I mixed up into a small container and after chilling will probably make a rather fine spread - for breakfast maybe?\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Cookery cheats]]\n[[Category:Fish recipes]]\n[[Category:Freshwater fish recipes]]\n[[Category:Sea fish recipes]]\n[[Category:Danish recipes]]\n[[Category:Snacks and light bites]]\n[[Category:Starters]]\n\n[[Category:Uncooked]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#smokedsalmon #smokedsalmontimbales #avocado #worcestershiresauce #ramekindishes #butter #doublecream #sourcream #dill #lemonjuice #creamcheese </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
