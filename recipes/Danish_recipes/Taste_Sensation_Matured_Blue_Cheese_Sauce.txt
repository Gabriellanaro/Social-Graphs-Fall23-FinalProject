(The [[Taste Sensation blue cheese powder]] has a very long shelf life, so I don't need to go shopping for [[Cheese|cheese]] to make the [[Sauce|sauce]]!)\n[[Image:MySampleBlueCheesePowder.jpg|thumb|300px|Taste Sensation Matured Blue Cheese powder|]]\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| 40 g [[Taste Sensation Matured Blue Cheese powder]]\n| 400 ml [[Milk|milk]] (or 4 tablespoons [[Milk powder|milk powder]] & 400ml water - see variations, below)\n| 40 g [[Butter|butter]] - 2 [[Scant|scant]] tablespoons (or [[Olive oil|olive oil]] - I find that preferable)\n| 30 g (2 tbs) [[Plain flour|plain flour]]\n}}\n\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| Add the [[Taste Sensation Matured Blue Cheese powder]] to the [[Milk|milk]] and [[Whisk|whisk]] until combined.  I find it combined better if left for 10 minutes and mixed again, but it seems to work well either way.\n| Heat the [[Butter|butter]] or [[Olive oil|olive oil]] in a pan, ensuring it does not burn!\n| Sprinkle the [[Plain flour|plain flour]] over the [[Oil|oil]] and mix into a [[Roux|roux]].\n| Pour in the water and gently [[Simmer|simmer]], stirring well until thickened.  Some say that the [[Milk|milk]] should be introduced bit-by-bit, but I find if you mix it while it heats, it works just as well.\n| Serve - Yum!\n}}\n===Variations===\nIf like me, you are making this during the CV19 'lock-down', we are avoiding going out shopping for [[Milk|milk]] as this introduces another unnecessary ''risk''.  We've fortunately managed to bulk-buy [[Dried milk powder|dried milk powder]]; 4 heaped tablespoons of [[Dried|dried]] [[Milk powder|milk powder]] makes up about 400 ml of milk - perfect for this [[Sauce|sauce]].\n===Chef's notes===\nI've included this in Danish recipes because I know that the [[Taste Sensation]] Blue [[Cheese powder]] is produced from [[Blue cheese|blue cheese]] made in Denmark.\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Danish recipes]]\n[[Category:French recipes]]\n[[Category:Dips and sauces]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes]]\n[[Category:Cheese recipes]]\n[[Category:Taste Sensation recipes]]\n[[Category:Recipes from other sites]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:12032020'>#oliveoil #tastesensationmaturedbluecheesepowder #tastesensation #butter #sauce #plainflour #milkpowder #tastesensationmaturedbluecheesesauce #cheesepowder #simmer #tastesensationrecipes</code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
