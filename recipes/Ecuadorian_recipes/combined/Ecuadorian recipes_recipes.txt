The dish is a classic Ecuadorian [[Cheese|cheese]] and [[Potato|potato]] [[Soup|soup]] from the Ecuadorian cuisine. This is also a dish in Peruvian cuisine, which at one point held the centre of the Inca empire. It typical also in Argentina prepared by the different native Indian tribes at the time of the [[Spanish]] conquest. Its origin [[Dates|dates]] to before the Spanish colonial times.\n\nThe defining ingredients are [[Corn|corn]], some form of [[Meat|meat]] (usually [[Beef|beef]], but sometimes [[Beef jerky|beef jerky]] or [[Chorizo|chorizo]]), and [[Vegetables|vegetables]]. Other ingredients vary widely, and typically include [[Onion|onion]], [[Beans|beans]], [[Squash|squash]] or [[Pumpkin|pumpkin]]. It is mainly eaten in winter.\n\nIn some parts, such as in the Santiago del Estero Province of Argentina, a red hot sauce made from red peppers and paprika known as [[quiquirimichi]] is served on the side.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 2 tablespoons [[Olive oil|olive oil]]\n| 2 large [[Onions|onions]], peeled and sliced\n| 4 [[Cloves garlic, peeled and crushed|cloves garlic, peeled and crushed]]\n| 750 g (1.5 lb) [[Beef|beef]] [[Stewing|stewing]] [[Steak|steak]], cut into cubes\n| 1 x 400g (14 oz) can of peeled [[Tomatoes|tomatoes]]\n| 1/2 a teaspoon of ground white [[cumin]]\n| 1/2 a teaspoon of dried [[oregano]]\n| 1 teaspoon freshly ground [[coriander]] seeds\n| 1 bay leaf\n| Juice from 1/2 a lemon\n| 150 ml (1/4 pint) [[Beef Stock|beef stock]]\n| 2 tablespoons of [[Paprika powder|paprika powder]]\n| &#189; of a teaspoon of [[Chilli powder|chilli powder]], or to taste.\n| 1 x 400g (14 oz) can of [[Chickpeas|chickpeas]], rinsed and drained\n| 125 g whole [[Chorizo sausage|chorizo sausage]], sliced thickly\n| 200 g can of [[Sweetcorn|sweetcorn]], rinsed and drained\n| 75 g [[Mozzarella cheese|mozzarella cheese]] cut into cubes\n| [[Salt]] and [[Freshly ground black pepper|freshly ground black pepper]] to taste\n| 2 tablespoons of [[masa harina]] or [[yellow cornmeal]], optional thickening.\n}}\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Locro simmering.jpg|Seal the lid with [[tin foil]] to prevent the stew from drying out\nImage:Locro pie.jpg|Locro pie with [[potato dumplings]]\nImage:Locro pie oven-ready.jpg|Locro pie with [[potato dumplings]], ready for the oven\n</gallery>\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Heat the [[Oil|oil]] in a large pan or [[Dutch Oven|Dutch oven]] and saut\u00e9 the [[Onions|onions]] and [[Garlic|garlic]] for 4 minutes or until softened and slightly coloured.\n| Reserve the onions, increase the heat and brown the beef, a handful of pieces at a time.\n| Add the onions back to the pan, together with the [[Tomatoes|tomatoes]] and their juice.

Whilst not the least bit authentic, it was rather delicious.  The [[potato dumplings]] were rolled in [[yellow cornmeal]] and laid on the top of the locro and covered with slices of [[mozzarella cheese]].

Thank you Julia!\n* [[Huacatay]] is a type of marigold and seeds can be obtained from:  '''[http://www.chilternseeds.co.uk/item_1222d_tagetes_minuta_seeds Chiltern Seeds]'''.  Looks like they kill off weeds as well!\n* [[Chicha de Jora]] is a bit trickier as it is a drink made from [[sweetcorn|corn]].  There is a recipe for making it [http://www.ehow.com/how_2099371_make-chicha-de-jora.html here] , but I would suggest substituting it with a slightly sweetish [[white wine]].\n* [[Chincho leaves]] - I think they will be impossible to get here.  Seems they are related to [[huacatay]] and used to be used to treat malaria.  I wonder if our friend can come up with a substitute.\n* [[Fava beans]].  [[Broad beans]] in pods are not often available, so most of the year, it would have to be frozen and I presume we should allow for that when giving a weight.\n\n\n''Thank you to our Peruvian visitor, Gloria Sebastiani for kindly providing this recipe''\n<span class=\"review\">\n<span class=\"reviewHeader\">\n====Best recipe review====\n</span>\n''<span class=\"reviewTitle\">Not able to try this out</span>''\n\n<span style=\"line-height:180%\"><span style=\"font-size:180%;\"><span class=\"reviewScore\">2.5</span>/5 </span>\n\n<span class=\"reviewDesc\">Nowhere near me I can dig a fire pit to do this.
