The standard girth size of a baguette is approx. 5 or 6 cm, but can be up to a meter in length.\n\nFrench food laws define bread as a product containing only the following four ingredients: water, [[flour]], [[yeast]], and [[common salt]]; the addition of any other ingredient to the basic recipe requires the baker to use a different name for the final product. As a result, the traditional baguette is made from a very lean [[dough]], made from a moderately soft flour. While a typical baguette is made with a direct addition of baker's yeast, it is not unusual for artisan-style loaves to be made with a poolish or other bread pre-ferment to increase flavour complexity, as well as the addition of [[whole wheat flour]] and other grains such as [[rye]]. French bread is required by law to avoid preservatives, and as a result baguettes quite frequently stale within a day of being baked.\n\nThis baguette recipe uses no [[Fats|fats]] or [[Oils|oils]], it has a delicious light airy texture and can be made in a [[Breadmaker|breadmaker]].\n\nUse menu 21 ''French dough'' (3 hours 35 minutes) on [[Panasonic SD-ZB2502 automatic breadmaker]]\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| &frac12; teaspoon [[Dried active yeast|dried active yeast]].\n| 250g (9 oz) [[Strong white flour|strong white flour]].\n| 1 teaspoon [[Sugar|sugar]].\n| 1 tablespoon [[Milk powder|milk powder]].\n| &frac12; teaspoon [[Salt|salt]].\n| 160 ml water.\n| 1 [[Egg white]] for glazing.\n| 15 g [[Sesame seeds]] or [[poppy seeds]] for sprinkling.\n| [[Fine yellow cornmeal]] for dusting.\n\n}}\n\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n* Preheat the [[Oven|oven]] to 220\u00b0 C (425\u00b0 F - gas 7)\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Add the ingredients to your [[Bread maker|bread maker]] on the [[French]] [[Dough|dough]] setting (or the longest dough setting available).
