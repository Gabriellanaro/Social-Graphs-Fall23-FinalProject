However, a recent reading of [[The Extraordinary Cookbook]] finally brought it to my attention.\n\nI have substituted the marvellous [[Pi\u00e9 d'Angloys cheese]] for the [[Vacherin]] used in Stefan's recipe as it is available all year round and is as ridiculously cheap as it gorgeous.  If you want to try the original, [[Vacherin cheese]] is usually available from August and end of March. I believe it is available in the UK from Waitrose during this period. [[\u00c9poisses de Bourgogne]] is another excellent candidate for this recipe.\n\nYou could of course try this with more than one [[Cheese|cheese]], but that would be greedy, wouldn't it?\n\n'''the [[Fondue|fondue]]'''\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 1 box of [[Pi\u00e9 d'Angloys cheese]]\n| 2 tablespoons of [[Dry sherry|dry sherry]]\n}}\n'''to [[Dip|dip]]'''\n{{RecipeIngredientsNB\n| 200 g Warm baby [[New Potatoes|new potatoes]]\n| 2 Sliced [[Ciabatta bread|ciabatta bread]] rolls\n| 150 g selection of thinly sliced cooked [[Meats|meats]]\n| 4 [[Pickled]] [[Gherkins|gherkins]]\n| 2 tablespoons [[Pickled red cabbage]]\n| 2 [[Pickled onions]]\n| A selection of raw and [[Blanched|blanched]] [[Vegetables|vegetables]]\n}}\n\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n* 180\u00b0 C (350\u00b0 F - gas 4), [fan [[Oven|oven]] 160\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Take the [[Cheese|cheese]] out of the box and line the box with a layer of good quality [[Tin foil|tin foil]] (some are better than others!)\n| Line the lid with tin-foil\n| Replace the [[Cheese|cheese]] in the box\n| Push the centre of the [[Cheese|cheese]] down to make a little 'well'\n| Use a fork to punch a few holes in the top of the [[Cheese|cheese]]\n| Pour the [[Sherry|sherry]] into the [[Cheese|cheese]]\n}}\n* Leave it for an hour or so if you have the time\n# Replace the lid and [[Bake|bake]] for 25 minutes\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Camembert fondue recipe.jpg|[[Camembert]] cooked\nImage:French cheese fondue sherry.jpg|The sherry soaking into the cheese\n</gallery>\n===Serving suggestions===\nBreak the top of the hot cheese open, sit the [[Cheese|cheese]] in the middle of the table and surround it with your friends, lots of plates, napkins and things to [[Dip|dip]] into the cheese\n===Chef's note===\nI couldn't get [[Pi\u00e9 d'Angloys cheese]] the day I made this so I used what was available from a very limited selection of cheeses at our local supermarket.
