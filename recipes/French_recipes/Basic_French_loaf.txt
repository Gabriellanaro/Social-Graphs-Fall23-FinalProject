Whilst it won't have the shape of a [[French baguette]], the flavour and texture is pretty close.\n\nWe have a [[Panasonic SD253 breadmaker]] and it is wonderful.  We have used it twice a week for the last year or so to make white or wholemeal loaves.  However, we have only recently tried some of the other recipes that came with the breadmaker.  Wow, they are really good.\n\nIf you have a Panasonic [[Breadmaker|breadmaker]], '''I urge you to try this recipe out!'''.  Also, if you wish to use genuine French bread [[flour]], it can be obtained from [[Wessexmill.co.uk|Wessex Flour Mill]] or one of their suppliers\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 1 teaspoon [[Dried yeast|dried yeast]]\n| 400 g (14 oz) Very [[Strong white flour|strong white flour]]\n| 15 g (1/2 oz) [[Butter|butter]] - don't be tempted to use [[olive oil]], it does not work as well for this recipe.\n| 1 teaspoon [[Salt|salt]]\n| 280 ml water - or by weight instead of volume, 280 g water\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Tip is all into the [[Breadmaker|breadmaker]]\n| For the [[Panasonic SD253 breadmaker]], Select '''French Bake''' program\n| For the [[Panasonic SD-ZB2502 automatic breadmaker]] use menu option 08, French bake\n| Wait 6 hours for closest you'll ever get to French [[Bread|bread]]\n}}\n===Chef's notes===\nIf this loaf does not rise properly and you are using in-date [[yeast]] and [[strong bread flour]] and then it might be problem with your [[breadmaker]].  With our late [[Panasonic SD253 breadmaker]], this was the recipe that failed to rise, when all other recipes seemed to work.  Eventually this was cured by the replacement: [[Panasonic SD-ZB2502 automatic breadmaker]].\n\n* See also: [[Bread rising problems]]\n<span class=\"review\">\n<span class=\"reviewHeader\">\n====Best recipe review====\n</span>\n''<span class=\"reviewTitle\">Breadmaking Perfection</span>''\n\n<span style=\"line-height:180%\"><span style=\"font-size:180%;\"><span class=\"reviewScore\">5</span>/5 </span>\n\n<span class=\"reviewDesc\">Since I added this recipe , seven years ago, we've probably used it three times a week since then.  The long rise time makes for a lovely light loaf, and as you don't have to do anything while it bakes, you may as well go for the longer bake to obtain the perfect loaf.</span> \n\n<span class=\"reviewAuthor\"> [[User:PSmith|Paul&nbsp;R&nbsp;Smith]] </span></span>\n\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes|French loaf]]\n[[Category:Bread and baking|French loaf]]\n[[Category:Breadmaker recipes|French loaf]]\n[[Category:French recipes|French loaf]][[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#breadmaker #basicfrenchloaf #panasonicsd253breadmaker #flour #strongbreadflour #breadrisingproblems #driedyeast #strongwhiteflour #butter #oliveoil #frenchbaguette </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
