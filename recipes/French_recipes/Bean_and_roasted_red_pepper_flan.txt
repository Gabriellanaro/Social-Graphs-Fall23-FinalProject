Michel's recipe uses [[Asparagus|asparagus]] and sem-[[Confit|confit]] [[Red peppers|red peppers]], but as asparagus is out of season and I can't be bothered to semi-confit the [[Peppers|peppers]], I have just [[Roasted|roasted]] therm and substituted the asparagus with fine [[Green beans|green beans]].\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 340g p\u00e2te bris\u00e9e \n| 170g fine [[Green beans|green beans]], trimmed, [[Boiled|boiled]] and drained\n| Seasoning\n| 5 [[Roasted red peppers|roasted red peppers]], skins removed and [[Diced|diced]]\n| 1 [[Egg|egg]], beaten\n| 2 [[Egg yolks|egg yolks]], beaten\n| 200ml [[Double cream|double cream]]\n| Pinch of [[Nutmeg|nutmeg]]\n| [[Chives]] or [[Parsley|parsley]], finely chopped, to garnish\n\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Roll out the [[Pastry|pastry]] thinly and use it to line a loose bottomed 35 x 11 cm and 2.5 cm deep tranche tin.\n| Place in the [[Fridge|fridge]] for 20 minutes.\n| Preheat the [[Oven|oven]] to 190\u00b0 C (375\u00b0 F - gas 5) and [[Bake|bake]] the case blind for 20 minutes.\n| Remove the [[Baking beans|baking beans]] and paper, reduce the [[Oven|oven]] to 170\u00b0 C (325\u00b0 F - gas 3) and [[Bake|bake]] the case for a further 10 minutes.\n| Cover the bottom of the case with the [[Diced|diced]] [[Red peppers|red peppers]].\n| Whisk the [[Eggs|eggs]], [[Cream|cream]], seasoning and [[Nutmeg|nutmeg]] and pour three-quarters of the mixture over the [[Peppers|peppers]].\n| Arrange the drained [[Beans|beans]] over the top and then pour over the remaining [[Egg|egg]] and [[Cream|cream]] mixture - you may find, as I did, that you have some mixture left over.\n| [[Bake]] for 30 minutes and let wait on a wire rack for 20 minutes before unmolding.\n| Garnish with the chopped [[Herbs|herbs]] and serve warm.\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe with [[Salad|salad]] and [[New Potatoes|new potatoes]].\n===Chef's notes===\nI would recommend placing the tranche tin on a [[Baking tray|baking tray]] before putting in the [[Oven|oven]].  This is because the [[Egg|egg]] and [[Cream|cream]] mixture is runny and may escape through the bottom of the tranche tin and make a mess of your oven.\n{{Quiche - See also}}\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:French recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Snacks and light bites]]\n[[Category:Starters]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes]]\n[[Category:Egg recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegetable recipes]]\n[[Category:Pies tarts and flans]]\n[[Category:Vegan recipes]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#cream #bake #beanandroastedredpepperflan #egg #nutmeg #redpeppers #diced #greenbeans #pastry #peppers #roasted </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
