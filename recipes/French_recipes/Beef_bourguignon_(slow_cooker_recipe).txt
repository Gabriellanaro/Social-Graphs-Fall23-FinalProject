It is essentially a stew prepared with beef [[Braised|braised]] in a full bodied [[Red wine|red wine]] and [[Beef stock|beef stock]], generally flavoured with [[Garlic|garlic]], [[Onions|onions]], [[Carrots|carrots]], and a [[Bouquet garni|bouquet garni]], and garnished with pearl [[Onions|onions]] and [[Mushrooms|mushrooms]].\n\nThis version is especially for a slow cooker and can be prepared with no pre-cooking and will cook in 8 hours (or more) so can be left cooking all day, while you are out at work.\n\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 450 g [[Stewing]] [[Steak|steak]], trimmed of excess [[Fat|fat]] and cut into bite-sized cubes\n| 3 large [[Carrots|carrots]], sliced in half length-wise.\n| 1 bottle of robust [[Red wine|red wine]] such as Bulls blood.\n| 225 ml beef stock made with 1 [[oxo cube]]\n| [[Bouquet garni]] (I used a variation on version 4)\n| half a lime (unsqueezed)\n| 8 [[banana shallots]], peeled and cut in half\n| 150g of [[button mushrooms]], sliced\n| 3 [[carrots]], scrubbed and sliced\n| 2 sticks of [[celery]] cut into moons\n| 110 g (4 oz) [[home smoked bacon]] or good quality smoked [[bacon]]\n| 1 tablespoon of [[plain flour]]\n| Pinch of salt\n| Good pinch of freshly ground [[black pepper]]\n| 6 small tomatoes cut in half\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Season the flour with [[salt]] and [[pepper]]\n| Roll the meat cubes in the flour to coat well - this will help to thicken the stew.\n| Add the remaining ingredients to the [[slow cooker]]\n| Stir well\n| Cook on low for 8 hours or more. As an experiment, I left the stew as photographed for 10 hours (on low).\n\n}}\n===Serving suggestion===\n\nOften served with [[noodles]], was also good with [[squash mash]] and garden peas. Also good with [[mashed potatoes]].\n\n===Variations===\nIf you have time beforehand, you can [[brown]] the whole [[shallots]] and the cubes of [[beef]] in a separate pan, before slow cooking. It adds a little colour and some extra flavour.  However, when testing this recipe, everything was tipped into the slow cooker, no pre-frying and the results were perfectly acceptable.\n==See also==\n* [[Boeuf bourguignon]]\n* [[Beef bourguignon recipe]]\n* [[Beef bourguignon recipe (PC)]]\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Beef recipes]]\n[[Category:Historic recipes]]\n[[Category:French recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:Stews and casseroles]]\n[[Category:Cooking with wine]]\n[[Category:Favourite recipes]]\n[[Category:Stewed, braised or pot roasted]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#carrots #redwine #beef #onions #bouquetgarni #slowcooker #mashedpotatoes #boeufbourguignon #celery #unusualrecipes #blackpepper </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
