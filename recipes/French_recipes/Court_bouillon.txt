Nowadays, it is usually mentioned in connection with [[fish and seafood]], but it is also used for poaching [[vegetables]], [[eggs]], and delicate [[meats]] such as cockscombs, sweetbreads, and the like.\n\nCourt-bouillon is 'short' (the literal meaning of the French word 'court') because the cooking time is brief in comparison with a rich and complex [[stock]], and generally is not served as part of the finished dish. Since delicate foods do not cook for very long, it is prepared before the foods are added.\n\nFor [[fish]], it is generally a mixture of water, acid ([[white wine]] or [[lemon]]), [[salt]], [[bouquet garni]], and [[black pepper]].\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 1 [[leek]], chopped\n| 1 [[onion]], chopped\n| 1 [[carrot]], peeled and chopped\n| 1 [[celery]] stick, chopped\n| 1 [[clove]] [[Garlic|garlic]], peeled\n| 1 sprig [[thyme]]\n| Few [[parsley]] stalks\n| 1 sprig [[tarragon]]\n| Handful of [[basil leaves]]\n| &#189; [[lemon]], sliced\n| 1 [[star anise]]\n| 100ml [[white wine]]\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Place all the ingredients in a large pan\n| Cover with cold water and bring to the [[boil]].
