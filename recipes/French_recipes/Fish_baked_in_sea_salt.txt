The [[Salt|salt]] seems to make it easy to remove the skin and keeps the [[Fish|fish]] really moist - it's also quite an impressive looking dish. We bought most of the ingredients from the local fishmonger who strangely, looked exactly like Poseidon himself!\n\nDon't be worried about the amount of [[Salt|salt]] used, it sticks to (and helps to remove) the skin and does not make the dish the least bit salty. The large [[Grains|grains]] of coarse [[Sea Salt|sea salt]] don't seem to permeate the [[Fish|fish]]. In [[France]], [[Sel gris]], the grey coloured [[Sea salt|sea salt]] is cheap and easily available in all supermarkets, that won't be the case in the UK unfortunately.\n  \nYou really do need coarse [[sea salt]] for this recipe, and quite a lot.  I've heard of 'the careful' using dishwasher salt for this though I would read the packaging very carefully first!\n<gallery widths=270px heights=270px perrow=5>\nImage:Lemon and parsley sauce.jpg|[[Lemon and parsley sauce]], simple, quick and effective\nImage:Fish in salt, baked.jpg|[[Baked|baked]] after 25 minutes\nImage:Two bream baked in sea salt recipe.jpg|Layer two, the second [[bream]] added.

[[Brush|brush]] any reaming salt from the fish and serve, covered with the hot [[Sauce|sauce]] and a sprinkle of [[Fresh herbs|fresh herbs]].\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe with [[New Potatoes|new potatoes]] and [[Peas|peas]].\n===Variations===\nNormally I would have copious amounts of [[fennel]] or [[dill]] from the garden, but being January in England, I have none.  I will not pay good coin for a measly bunches of supermarket herbs so added three tablespoons of [[fennel seed]] to the [[sea salt]].  It was a good substitute, though fresh herbs would be better.\n===Chef's notes===\nI used 2 small [[bream]] instead of 1 large [[sea bass]] this time, both in the same salt-dish. It presents much better with just one fish - hence the lacking photographs!\n\nVery recently I saw Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall cooking [[seabass]] in salt, he used a few kilograms of normal table salt, cleverly dampened down with little water to make a firm 'cement'.  Using this method packed the salt around his sea bass on a flat tray, rather like a jelly-mould of yester-year. It made a great table presentation.  I will try this next time.\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:French recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Fish recipes]]\n[[Category:Sea fish recipes]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#fish #fishbakedinseasalt #seabass #bream #dill #sauce #fennel #lemon #parsley #france #bakingtray </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
