I always forget.\n\nWell, Cottage, [[Cheddar]], [[Caerphilly]] and [[Stilton]] worked out very well so now it's time to try making [[Camembert cheese]] at home.  As with the last few that I've made, I am using full-[[Fat|fat]] [[Milk|milk]] and adding [[Double cream|double cream]] for that rich, creamy, high-[[cholesterol]] effect!\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 4 [[Litres|litres]] full [[Fat|fat]] [[Milk|milk]]\n| 300 ml [[Double cream|double cream]]\n| 5 ml [[Liquid starter|liquid starter]] or a little [[Freeze|freeze]]-[[Dried|dried]] [[DVI starter]] (as much as will go on the tip of a pointed knife - see picture) \n| 3 drops of [[Rennet|rennet]]\n| A little [[Freeze|freeze]]-[[Dried|dried]] Penicillium culture (as much as will go on the tip of a pointed knife - see picture)\n\n}}\n\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n* [[Sterilise]] all equipment\n* Add 3 drops of [[Rennet|rennet]] to 1 tablespoon of cold, previously [[Boiled|boiled]] water, mix well.\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:DoubleBoiler.jpg|Use a double boiler so you don't scald the milk\nImage:Knife-tip-DVI.jpg|DVI - Knife-tips worth\nImage:Knife-tip-Candidum.jpg|Penicillum candidum - Knife-tips worth\n</gallery>\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| If using [[Unpasteurised|unpasteurised]] [[Milk|milk]], pasteurise and allow to cool, add the [[Double cream|double cream]] and stabilise at 29\u00b0 C\n| If using shop-bought [[Milk|milk]], add the [[Double cream|double cream]] and adjust the temperature to  29\u00b0 C.\n| Add the [[Freeze|freeze]] [[Dried|dried]] [[DVI]] and the Penicillium culture by sprinkling on the surface of the [[Milk|milk]] and whisking well.\n| After 30 minutes check the temperature is still 29\u00b0 C, add the diluted [[Rennet|rennet]], cover and leave until the [[Curd|curd]] has set, ensuring the temperature remains constant.  I find covering with a few towels [[Help|help]]s keep retain the temperature.\n| Once the [[Curd|curd]] has set, don't [[Cut the curds|cut the curds]] with a knife, but ladle, in large slices directly into the [[Mould|mould]].\n| Leave to drain at 20\u00b0.  When the [[Curds|curds]] are firm, turn upside-down and continue draining.  This entire process may take a day or so.\n| When the [[Curds|curds]] are firm enough to remove from the [[Mould|mould]], rub with a fine dusting of [[Salt|salt]].\n| Transfer to a [[Drying|drying]] area (18\u00b0 C / 80% humidity) for 2 days.\n| Then move to a ripening area (around 12\u00b0 C / 80% humidity) for about 10 days or more, by which time the [[Mould|mould]] should have formed.\n| Unless you have a cave handy, the [[fridge]] is probably the best place to mature your [[homemade cheese]] although it's really going to be too cold. After discovering the top shelf of my often-opened fridge could be as much as 5\u00b0 C warmer than the bottom, I've decided to mature my cheeses there.  As all fridges differ, check various areas of your fridge with a thermometer to find the area that is around 11\u00b0C [51\u00b0 F], the ideal 'cave' temperature.\n}}\n===Chef's notes===\nWhen trying to stabilise the temperature, take your time and don't rush or you will almost certainly overheat the [[Milk|milk]] and spoil your [[Cheese|cheese]].\n\nIt's quite useful, once you think you have stabilised the [[Milk|milk]] at a certain temperature, to leave if for 30 minutes and then check the temperature again before starting your [[Cheese making|cheese making]].\n\nDusting with [[Salt|salt]]:  I find that I use less salt but get a more even covering if I dust with salt that has been [[Ground|ground]] to a very fine powder in a [[Coffee grinder|coffee grinder]] first.\n\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes|Camembert cheese]]\n[[Category:Cheese making|Camembert cheese]]\n[[Category:French recipes|Camembert cheese]]\n[[Category:Cheese recipes|Camembert cheese]]\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#doublecream #dried #freeze #mould #fat #cheese #homemadecamembertcheese #curd #curds #frenchrecipescamembertcheese #cutthecurds </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
