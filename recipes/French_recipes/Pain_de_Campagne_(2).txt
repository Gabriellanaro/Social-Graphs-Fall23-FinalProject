This version also contains [[Spelt|spelt]] [[Flour|flour]].  For this recipe, the [[Dough|dough]] is made in a [[Breadmaker|breadmaker]] but the [[Bread|bread]] is [[Baked|baked]] in the [[Oven|oven]].\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 1&frac12; teaspoons easy-blend [[Yeast|yeast]]\n| 300 g [[French bread]] [[Flour|flour]] or strong, plain [[Bread|bread]] flour\n| 150 g [[Spelt|spelt]] [[Flour|flour]]\n| 50 g [[Rye flour|rye flour]]\n| 1&frac12; teaspoons [[Salt|salt]]\n| 1&frac12; teaspoons [[Sugar|sugar]]\n| 25 g [[Butter|butter]]\n| 350 ml [[Milk|milk]]\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Put the ingredients into the [[Bread maker|bread maker]] in the order specified in your instruction manual.  The above order is correct for the [[Panasonic SD253]], SD254 and SD255.\n| If you have one, set to [[French bread]] programme; if not, set to the programme which has the longest rising time.  This is menu option 08 for the [[Panasonic SD-ZB2502 automatic breadmaker]]\n| One the process has finished, knock the [[Dough|dough]] back and place, seam side uppermost, in a lightly oiled, well floured [[Banneton|banneton]] basket.\n| Leave in a [[warm place]], covered with a damp [[Tea-towel|tea-towel]] until double its size.\n| Preheat the [[Oven|oven]] to 220\u00b0 C (425\u00b0 F - gas 7) - if you wish for a crispy crust, place a bowl of water in the oven at this time.\n| Grease a [[Baking|baking]] sheet or line it with [[Bake-O-Glide]].\n| When the [[Dough|dough]] has risen, place the [[Baking|baking]] sheet, upside down, on top of the [[banneton]] basket.\n| Quickly, but carefully, flip the whole thing over so that the [[Dough|dough]] is now on the [[baking tray]].\n| Place in the [[Oven|oven]] immediately and allow to [[Bake|bake]] for 10-15 minutes.\n| Reduce the temperature to 190\u00b0 C (375\u00b0 F - gas 5) and [[Bake|bake]] for a further 15-20 minutes until the [[Bread|bread]] sounds hollow when tapped.\n}}\n===Variations===\nYou can make the whole thing in the [[Breadmaker|breadmaker]] if you wish and shape it any way you like, although you may need to adjust the cooking time and temperature if making a long loaf.\n===Chef's notes===\nFrom what I can establish, the best combination of [[flours]] to use for flouring the [[banneton]] is half [[rice flour]] and half ordinary [[plain flour]].  For this recipe, I used the [[rye]] blade in the machine.  This was purely because I had 'lost' the normal blade - which I eventually realised was still in the [[Ballymaloe brown bread]] that I had made the day before! I am sure a normal blade would be fine as half of the [[flour]] is [[wheat flour]].  \n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes|Pain de campagne (2)]]\n[[Category:Bread and baking|Pain de campagne (2)]]\n[[Category:Breadmaker recipes|Pain de campagne (2)]]\n[[Category:French recipes|Pain de campagne (2)]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes|Pain de campagne (2)]]\n[[Category:Favourite recipes]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#flour #dough #breadmaker #bread #banneton #baking #bake #spelt #frenchbread #warmplace #ballymaloebrownbread </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
