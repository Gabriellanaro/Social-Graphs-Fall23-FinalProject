The weight of the blades will [[Help|help]] the [[Dough|dough]] to drop out of the bowl onto the surface.\n| Pull any remaining bits of [[Dough|dough]] off the blades and out of the TM bowl.\n| Shape into a ball, place in an oiled bowl and cover with [[Cling-film|cling-film]] or a shower cap.\n| Leave until the [[Dough|dough]] has almost doubled in size (about an hour).\n| Knock the [[Dough|dough]] back and place, seam side uppermost, in a lightly oiled, well floured [[Banneton|banneton]] basket.\n| Leave in a [[warm place]], covered with [[Cling-film|cling-film]] or shower cap until double its size.\n| Preheat the [[Oven|oven]] to '''220\u00b0 C (425\u00b0 F - gas 7)''' - if you wish for a crispy crust, place a bowl of water in the oven at this time.\n| Grease a [[Baking|baking]] sheet or line it with [[Bake-O-Glide]] you can also use a preheated [[Baking stone|baking stone]], dusted with [[Semolina|semolina]], in which case you will need a peel to transfer the [[Bread|bread]].\n| When the [[Dough|dough]] has risen, place the [[Baking|baking]] sheet, upside down, on top of the [[Banneton|banneton]] basket.\n| Quickly, but carefully, flip the whole thing over so that the [[Dough|dough]] is now on the [[Baking tray|baking tray]].\n| Place in the [[Oven|oven]] immediately and allow to [[Bake|bake]] for 20 minutes.\n| Reduce the temperature to '''190\u00b0 C (375\u00b0 F - gas 5)''' and [[Bake|bake]] for a further 20-25 minutes until the [[Bread|bread]] sounds hollow when tapped.\n}}\n===Chef's notes===\nFrom what I can establish, the best combination of [[Flours|flours]] to use for flouring the [[Banneton|banneton]] is half [[Rice flour|rice flour]] or [[Semolina|semolina]] and half ordinary [[Plain flour|plain flour]].  I always [[Oil|oil]] the banneton before flouring and line it with a hair net (helps the [[Dough|dough]] to be easily released from the basket).  This can also be [[Baked|baked]] in a 1kg loaf tin.\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:French recipes]]\n[[Category:Bread and baking]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes]]\n[[Category:Thermomix recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#dough #bread #flour #banneton #knead #semolina #bake #baking #yeast #butter #thermomix </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
