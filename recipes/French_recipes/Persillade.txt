The root of the word is persil, the French word for [[parsley]]. Simple to make, but a common ingredient in many dishes, it is often included in a saut\u00e9 cook's [[mise en place]]. It can be added early in a dish for a mellow flavour, added at the very end of the cooking to provide a garlicky jolt, or even used raw as a garnish.\n\nA classic French bistro dish is [[Pommes persillade]], basically cubed [[potatoes]] fried in small amount of oil, with persillade added at the end of the cooking. New Orleans chef Austin Leslie's signature dish was Fried Chicken with Persillade--basically fried chicken with the garlic and parsley mixture added as a garnish.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 3 tablespoons [[olive oil]]\n| 1 [[garlic clove, crushed]]\n| 1 cup [[breadcrumbs]]\n| 3 tablespoons [[parsley]], chopped\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Heat the [[olive oil]] in a frying pan, add the garlic and breadcrumbs and stir-fry for a minute or so, then combine with the parsley.\n| Allow to cool and serve.\n}}\n===Chef's note===\nThis can be made without the breadcrumbs, depending on the dish it is to be served with.\n==See also==\n* [[Gremolata]], similar to persillade but with added lemon zest.\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Ingredients]]\n[[Category:Condiments]]\n[[Category:Herbs]]\n[[Category:Prepared foods]]\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Accompaniments]]\n[[Category:Dips and sauces]]\n[[Category:Marinades dressings and butters]]\n[[Category:Vegetable recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes]]\n[[Category:French recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegan recipes]]\n[[Category:Pan fried]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#persillade #parsley #oliveoil #miseenplace #garlic #breadcrumbs #gremolata #potatoes #panfried </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
