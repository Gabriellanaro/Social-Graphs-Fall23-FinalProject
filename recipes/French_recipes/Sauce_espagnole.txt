Auguste Escoffier codified the recipe in the late 19th century, which is still followed today.\n\nEven though espagnole is the French word for Spanish, the sauce has little connection with Spanish cuisine. According to Louis Diat, the creator of [[vichyssoise]] and the author of the classic Gourmet's Basic French Cookbook: \"There is a story that explains why the most important basic brown [[sauce]] in French cuisine is called sauce espagnole, or Spanish sauce. According to the story, the Spanish cooks of Louis XIII's bride, Anne, helped to prepare their wedding feast, and insisted upon improving the rich brown [[sauce]] of France with Spanish [[tomatoes]]. This new sauce was an instant success, and was gratefully named in honour of its creators.\"\n\nEspagnole has a strong taste and is rarely used directly on food. As a mother [[sauce]], however, it then serves as the starting point for many derivative sauces, such as Sauce Africaine, Sauce Bigarade, Sauce Bourguignonne, Sauce aux Champignons, Sauce Charcutiere, Sauce Chasseur, Sauce Chevreuil and Demi-glace. There are hundreds of other derivatives in the classic French repertoire.\n\nA typical espagnole recipe takes many hours or even several days to make, and produces four to five quarts of sauce. In most derivative recipes, however, one cup of espagnole is more than enough, so that the basic recipe will yield enough [[sauce]] for 16 to 20 meals. [[Frozen]] in small quantities, espagnole will keep practically indefinitely.  The following recipe is for a much smaller quantity.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| 25g unsalted [[butter]]\n| 1 tbsp [[ham]], finely diced\n| 1 large [[carrot]], peeled and diced\n| 1 [[onion]], finely chopped\n| 1 stick [[celery]], finely chopped\n| 2 tbsps [[mushrooms]], chopped\n| 1 [[bay leaf]]\n| 1 sprig [[thyme]]\n| 25g plain [[flour]]\n| 1 litre strong [[meat]] [[stock]], heated\n| 600g tinned, chopped [[tomatoes]] or use the equivalent in fresh if they are ripe enough\n| Seasoning\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| Melt half of the [[butter]] in a heavy pan.\n| Saut\u00e9 the [[ham]], [[carrot]], [[onion]], [[celery]], [[mushrooms]] and the [[herbs]] for about 20-30 minutes until they are soft and slightly caramelised.\n| Remove from the pan and reserve.\n| Melt the remaining [[butter]], add the [[flour]] and stir until the mixture becomes nut brown.\n| Remove from the heat and stir in a little [[stock]].\n| Return the [[flour]] mixture to the heat and gradually stir in the remaining [[stock]] until smooth.\n| Bring to the boil, add the reserved [[vegetables]] and the [[tomatoes]]. \n| Bring to the boil again and reduce the heat.\n| Simmer (it should not bubble) very gently for 2-3 hours until the [[sauce]] has reduced by half.\n| Skim from time to time.\n| Allow to cool slightly, then strain through muslin.\n| Put a few small pieces of [[butter]] over the top to prevent a skin forming.\n}}\n\n===Variations===\nThere are some derivative recipes which call for this to be [[fish]] based, in which case substitute the [[meat]] [[stock]] for [[fish]] stock.\n\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:French recipes]]\n[[Category:Dips and sauces]]\n[[Category:Boiled or simmered]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#sauce #sauceespagnole #butter #stock #flour #tomatoes #mushrooms #ham #carrot #celery #onion </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
