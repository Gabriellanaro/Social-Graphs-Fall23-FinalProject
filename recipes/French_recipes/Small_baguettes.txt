This is based on a recipe in  Richard Berthinet's '''[[Dough]]''' (ISBN 9781856267625).  I have started by making an overnight sponge, to encourage [[Yeast|yeast]] activity, but you can omit that stage if you like and mix in all the ingredients at the same time.\n\nThis time, I am letting my Kenwood Chef do a lot of the hard work.  If using a stand food [[Mixer|mixer]], you can use its bowl right from starting the sponge.  For a Kenwood Chef, you can use the bowl cover that comes with it, rather than mess about with [[Clingfilm|clingfilm]].   I am not sure if Kitchen Aids come with a clip on cover, so if they don't you will have to remove the bowl from the machine and cover with clingfilm or a damp cloth.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 10g fresh [[Yeast|yeast]]\n| 350g [[Sparkling mineral water|sparkling mineral water]]\n| 500g strong [[Bread|bread]] [[Flour|flour]] - you may need to use more water if using very strong bread [[Flour|flour]]\n| 10g [[Salt|salt]]\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| The night before you want to [[Bake|bake]] the [[Bread|bread]], dissolve the [[Yeast|yeast]] in the water,\n| [[Sieve]] 250g [[Flour|flour]] into a large bowl and stir in the water and dissolved [[Yeast|yeast]]. Do NOT add the [[Salt|salt]] at this stage as its will interfere with yeast activity.\n| Mix thoroughly.\n| Cover with [[Clingfilm|clingfilm]] and leave at room temperature overnight.\n| If it becomes very active, [[Refrigerate|refrigerate]] and bring to room temperature in the morning.\n| The next day, [[Sieve|sieve]] the remaining 250g [[Flour|flour]] with the [[Salt|salt]] and add to the bowl.\n| Mix thoroughly (Kenwood Chef - lowest speed for 2 minutes) and leave to rest for 20 minutes. The [[Dough|dough]] should be fairly sticky, so add more water if necessary. \n| [[Knead]], using your desired method until you have an elastic [[Dough|dough]]  (Kenwood - 2nd slowest speed for 6 minutes).\n| Shape into a ball and leave it to rest for an hour in an oiled bowl, covered with [[Clingfilm|clingfilm]], until the [[Dough|dough]] has almost doubled in size.\n| Lightly [[Flour|flour]] a work surface and gently deflate the [[Dough|dough]].  (Kenwood - deflate for a few seconds on slowest speed - no need for further [[Kneading|kneading]].)\n| [[Knead]] briefly and repeat the two previous steps, but do not vigorously deflate the [[Dough|dough]].\n| Divide into 4 equal pieces and allow to rest, covered, on the work surface.\n| Shape each piece into [[Baguettes|baguettes]] and place on a floured couche cloth or [[Baguette|baguette]] tin.\n| Cover and leave to prove for about 45 minutes until almost doubled in size.\n| Cover with a damp cloth or oiled [[Clingfilm|clingfilm]] and leave to prove for up to 45 minutes.\n| Make a few diagonal slashes in the loaves and leave to rest for a further 10 minutes\n| [[Bake]] at 230\u00b0 C (450\u00b0 F - gas 8), [fan [[Oven|oven]] 210\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour] for 15 minutes.\n| Allow to cool on a wire rack.\n}}\n===Chef's notes===\nI am still trying to get the knack of slashing the [[Dough|dough]]!\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:French recipes]]\n[[Category:Bread and baking]]\n[[Category:Vegan recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes]]\n[[Category:Breadmaker recipes]][[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#dough #flour #clingfilm #yeast #smallbaguettes #knead #bread #baguettes #bake #sieve #kneading </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
