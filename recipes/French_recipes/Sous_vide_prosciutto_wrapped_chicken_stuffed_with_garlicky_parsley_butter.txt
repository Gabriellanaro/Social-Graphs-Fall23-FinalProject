I tried again, this time with bacon and the result was marvellous: see [[Sous vide bacon wrapped chicken filled with garlic and cheese]]\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| 2 large [[Chicken breast|chicken breast]] fillets\n| 1 packet of [[Prosciutto|prosciutto]] [[Ham|ham]] (10 very thin slices)\n| Big handful of fresh [[Parsley|parsley]] including stems, finely chopped\n| 1 tablespoon [[Butter|butter]]\n| 4 [[Cloves of garlic|cloves of garlic]], peeled and roughly chopped (or to taste)\n| Pinch  of [[Sea Salt|sea salt]]\n| Good pinch of [[Freshly ground black pepper|freshly ground black pepper]]\n}}\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Garlic chicken ready to sous vide.jpg|Wrapped, vacuum sealed and ready to sous-vide\nImage:Stuffing the chicken breasts.jpg|Stuffing the chicken breasts with garlic herb butter\nImage:Making the garlic herb butter.jpg|Making the garlic herb butter\n</gallery>\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| Add the [[Garlic|garlic]], [[Parsley|parsley]], [[Salt|salt]] and [[Pepper|pepper]] to a [[Mortar and pestle|mortar and pestle]] and smash to a pulp\n| Add the [[Butter|butter]], smash it to combine with the [[Herbs|herbs]]\n| Cut a couple of pockets into the [[Chicken breasts|chicken breasts]] and stuff with the [[Garlic butter|garlic butter]]\n| Lay out the [[Prosciutto|prosciutto]] slices and roll up the [[Chicken breasts|chicken breasts]]\n| Pop into plastic bags and [[Vacuum seal|vacuum seal]]\n| Cook in a preheated [[Sous-vide|sous-vide]] bath at 64\u00b0C (''147.2\u00b0F'') for 1 hour\n| When cooked the proscuitto packets can be [[Seared|seared]] in a hot pan or by a [[Blowtorch|blowtorch]]. \n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe with [[Boiled potatoes|boiled potatoes]], [[Peas|peas]] and [[Sweetcorn|sweetcorn]] kernels.\n===Chef's notes===\nThis was rather disappointing in the end and also rather dry in comparison with meat usually cooked sous vide. The chicken breasts I used had been previously frozen, I wonder if that might have made a subtle difference.\n\nI will persist with this and make some changes, a little [[sherry]] might make a difference.\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:French recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Garlic recipes]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:Poultry recipes]]\n[[Category:Sous vide recipes]]\n[[Category:Sous vide cooking]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#parsley #chickenbreasts #prosciutto #sousvideprosciuttowrappedchickenstuffedwithgarlickyparsleybutter #butter #blowtorch #clovesofgarlic #chickenbreast #seared #peas #vacuumseal </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
