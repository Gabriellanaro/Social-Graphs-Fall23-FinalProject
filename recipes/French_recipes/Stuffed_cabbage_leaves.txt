It is a [[French]] recipe, typical of the Lorraine region.\n[[Image:Cheese and tomato sauce added, ready for the oven.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Cheese and tomato sauce added, ready for the oven]]\n[[Image:Finished mince with two baby cabbages.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Finished mince with two baby cabbages]]\n\nIt was nice but the stems of the cabbage were rather tough so when I next make it I will use 1 large cabbage and make two `leaves` from each one by cutting in half and discarding the stem.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 1 freshly picked [[Cabbage|cabbage]]\n| 500 g (1 lb) lean [[Sausage|sausage]] [[Meat|meat]]\n| 1 thick slice of stale [[White bread|white bread]] soaked in little [[Milk|milk]] for 30 minutes to soften.\n|* If using dried breadcrumbs, allow 1 cup with 120 ml of milk\n| 4 Cloves of [[Garlic|garlic]], peeled and crushed\n| A handful of freshly picked mixed [[Herbs|herbs]] - [[Parsley|parsley]], [[Thyme|thyme]], [[Rosemary|rosemary]], etc. stems removed and finely chopped.\n| [[Sea Salt|sea salt]] and [[Freshly ground black pepper|freshly ground black pepper]]\n| 3 tablespoons of [[Tomato|tomato]] pur\u00e9e\n| About a tablespoon of [[Butter]]\n| 100 g Gruy\u00e8re [[Cheese|cheese]], [[Grated|grated]]\n\n}}\n\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n* Preheat the [[Oven|oven]] to 190\u00b0 C (375\u00b0 F - gas 5)\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Clean and trim the [[Cabbage|cabbage]], removing any woody parts.\n| [[Blanch]] the [[Cabbage|cabbage]] in salted [[Boiling|boiling]] water for 15 minute. Remove and drain, reserving the cooking liquor.\n| Cook the [[Sausage|sausage]]-[[Meat|meat]] in 5 or 6 tablespoons of the [[Cabbage|cabbage]] liquor for about 15 minutes, breaking it up now and then.  When the meat has cooked for 15 minutes, remove and drain, reserving the cooking juices to add to the tomato pur\u00e9e.\n| Squeeze most of the milk from the bread and break into small pieces.\n| Mix the [[Garlic|garlic]], cooked sausage meat, bread and [[Herbs|herbs]] together and season well.\n| Remove the leaves, cutting out any really hard stalks and add 1 tablespoon of the [[Sausage|sausage]]-[[Meat|meat]] to each leaf and roll into an oval.\n| Mix the [[Tomato|tomato]] pur\u00e9e with about 284 ml (1/2 pint) of the cooking liquor.\n| Pack the rolled leaves into an [[Oven|oven]]-proof dish and pour the tomato sauce over the top.\n| Place a few dabs of [[Butter|butter]] over the [[Cabbage|cabbage]] and sprinkle with the [[Grated|grated]] [[Cheese|cheese]].\n| Add another grind of pepper and [[Bake]] for 25 minutes.\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe with [[Jacket potatoes|jacket potatoes]] or [[Mashed potatoes|mashed potatoes]].\n\n===Chef's notes===\nRather than buy dubious [[sausage meat]], I used a 250 g of [[pork fillet]] (blitzed in a [[food processor]] with a metal blade) and 250 g [[minced]] [[beef]].  I also added a little fat from my [[Home smoked bacon]].\n\n2 baby [[cabbages]] and were just enough.  When cooking them, half cover them with water, boil with a lid and turn them often.\n\nI added a glug of white wine to the tomato sauce as there was some in the fridge.\n\n{{Template:ThinkPig}}\n<gallery widths=270px heights=270px perrow=5>\nImage:Minced beef and pork tenderloin.jpg|Minced beef and pork tenderloin\nImage:Finished mince with two baby cabbages.jpg|Finished mince with two baby cabbages\nImage:Tomato sauce.jpg|Ready to construct\nImage:A tablespoon in every cabbage leaf.jpg|A tablespoon in every cabbage leaf\nImage:All rolled up.jpg|All rolled up\nImage:Cheese and tomato sauce added, ready for the oven.jpg|Cheese and tomato sauce added, ready for the oven\nImage:Stuffed cabbage leaves recipe.jpg|Stuffed cabbage leaves\n</gallery>\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Beef recipes]]\n[[Category:French recipes]]\n[[Category:Lamb recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:Pork recipes]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#stuffedcabbageleaves #cabbage #sausage #cheese #herbs #garlic #grated #tomato #butter #rosemary #beef </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
