The standard girth size of a baguette is approx. 5 or 6 cm, but can be up to a meter in length.\n\nFrench food laws define bread as a product containing only the following four ingredients: water, [[flour]], [[yeast]], and [[common salt]]; the addition of any other ingredient to the basic recipe requires the baker to use a different name for the final product. As a result, the traditional baguette is made from a very lean [[dough]], made from a moderately soft flour. While a typical baguette is made with a direct addition of baker's yeast, it is not unusual for artisan-style loaves to be made with a poolish or other bread pre-ferment to increase flavour complexity, as well as the addition of [[whole wheat flour]] and other grains such as [[rye]]. French bread is required by law to avoid preservatives, and as a result baguettes quite frequently stale within a day of being baked.\n\nThis baguette recipe uses no [[Fats|fats]] or [[Oils|oils]], it has a delicious light airy texture and can be made in a [[Breadmaker|breadmaker]].\n\nUse menu 21 ''French dough'' (3 hours 35 minutes) on [[Panasonic SD-ZB2502 automatic breadmaker]]\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| &frac12; teaspoon [[Dried active yeast|dried active yeast]].\n| 250g (9 oz) [[Strong white flour|strong white flour]].\n| 1 teaspoon [[Sugar|sugar]].\n| 1 tablespoon [[Milk powder|milk powder]].\n| &frac12; teaspoon [[Salt|salt]].\n| 160 ml water.\n| 1 [[Egg white]] for glazing.\n| 15 g [[Sesame seeds]] or [[poppy seeds]] for sprinkling.\n| [[Fine yellow cornmeal]] for dusting.\n\n}}\n\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n* Preheat the [[Oven|oven]] to 220\u00b0 C (425\u00b0 F - gas 7)\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Add the ingredients to your [[Bread maker|bread maker]] on the [[French]] [[Dough|dough]] setting (or the longest dough setting available).

Also good with [[mashed potatoes]].\n\n===Variations===\nIf you have time beforehand, you can [[brown]] the whole [[shallots]] and the cubes of [[beef]] in a separate pan, before slow cooking. It adds a little colour and some extra flavour.  However, when testing this recipe, everything was tipped into the slow cooker, no pre-frying and the results were perfectly acceptable.\n==See also==\n* [[Boeuf bourguignon]]\n* [[Beef bourguignon recipe]]\n* [[Beef bourguignon recipe (PC)]]\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Beef recipes]]\n[[Category:Historic recipes]]\n[[Category:French recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:Stews and casseroles]]\n[[Category:Cooking with wine]]\n[[Category:Favourite recipes]]\n[[Category:Stewed, braised or pot roasted]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#carrots #redwine #beef #onions #bouquetgarni #slowcooker #mashedpotatoes #boeufbourguignon #celery #unusualrecipes #blackpepper </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"

The bouquet is boiled (usually for a long time) with the other ingredients, but is removed prior to consumption.\n\nThere is no generic recipe for bouquet garni, but most recipes include [[parsley]], [[thyme]] and [[bay leaf]]. Depending on the recipe, the bouquet garni may include [[basil]], [[celery|celery leaves]], [[thyme]], [[chervil]], [[rosemary]], [[peppercorns]], [[savory]] and [[tarragon]]. Sometimes, [[vegetables]] such as [[carrot]], [[celery]], [[celery|celery root]], [[leek]], [[onion]] and [[Parsley|parsley root]], are also included in the bouquet.  For [[stock]] making, the most common [[herbs]] are [[thyme]], [[parsley]] and [[bay leaves]].\n\nOccasionally, the bouquet is not bound with string, and its ingredients are instead filled into a small sachet, a net, or even a tea strainer, when it is known as a [[Sachet d'\u00e9pices|sachet d'\u00e9pices]].\n\nTraditionally, the aromatics are bound within [[leek]] leaves, though a coffee filter or [[butcher's twine]]/[[kitchen string]] can be used in their place.\n\nDishes made with a bouquet garni include:\n* [[Beef Bourguignon]]\n* [[Pot au feu]]\n* [[Poule au pot]]\n* Carbonnade flamande\n* Lapin chasseur\n* [[Ossobuco]]\n* [[Bouillabaisse]]\n==See also==\nWe have a number of bouquets garni recipes tailored for specific dishes\n* [[Basic bouquet garni]]\n* [[Bouquet garni for beef]]\n* [[Bouquet garni for fish]]\n* [[Bouquet garni for game]]\n* [[Bouquet garni for lamb]]\n* [[Bouquet garni for mutton]]\n* [[Bouquet garni for pork]]\n* [[Bouquet garni for poultry]]\n* [[Bouquet garni for vegetables]]\n{{CategoryLineIngredients}}\n[[Category:Ingredients]]\n[[Category:Herbs]]\n[[Category:French recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:12032020'>#bouquetgarni #herbs #celery #parsley #thyme #leek #stock #rosemary #soup #beefbourguignon #bouquetgarniformutton </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"

The chef cut up the chicken (reportedly with a sabre) and [[fried]] it in [[olive oil]], made a [[sauce]] from the [[tomatoes]], [[Garlic|garlic]] and [[onions]] (plus a bit of cognac from Napoleon's flask), cooked the crayfish, fried the [[eggs]] and served them as a garnish, with some of the soldier's [[bread]] ration on the side. Napoleon reportedly liked the dish and (having won the battle) considered it lucky. He refused to have the ingredients altered on future occasions even when his chef tried to omit the crayfish.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 1 cup [[crayfish]] tails\n| 1.2kg whole [[chicken]], jointed\n| 1 large [[onion]], peeled and chopped\n| 1 [[clove]] of [[Garlic|garlic]], crushed\n| 6 [[tomatoes]], chopped or 1 small can of [[tomatoes]], chopped\n| 6 tablespoons [[brandy]] or [[dry sherry]]\n| 2 tablespoons [[plain flour]]\n| [[Salt]] and [[freshly ground black pepper]] to taste\n| Handful of torn [[basil leaves]]\n| 3 tablespoons [[black olives]]\n| 2 Free range [[eggs]] to garnish -(optional but authentic!) \n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| [[Parson's nose|Remove the parson's nose]]\n| [[Joint the chicken]]\n| Season the [[flour]] with [[salt]] and [[pepper]] and roll the [[chicken]] pieces in the [[flour]] \n| In a large pot, heat the [[olive oil]] and brown the [[chicken]] pieces, reserve and keep warm\n| Add the [[onion]] and [[Garlic|garlic]] (and a little more [[olive oil]] if needed) and soften the [[onions]]\n| Add the [[chicken]] back to the pan and add the [[tomatoes]] and [[brandy]], cover and [[simmer]] on a low heat for 30 minutes\n| Add the [[crayfish]] tails and [[simmer]] for a further 10 minutes\n| At the last minutes, stir in the [[basil leaves]] and [[olives]]\n| [[Fry]] the [[eggs]] and serve as a garnish with the finished dish\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\n\nTo win all of your battles, serve with crusty [[bread]] or [[boiled potatoes]]\n==See also==\n* {{See also - Jointing a chicken}}\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Historic recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:Poultry recipes]]\n[[Category:French recipes]]\n[[Category:Boiled or simmered]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#chicken #tomatoes #oliveoil #eggs #garlic #onions #chickenmarengo #crayfish #basilleaves #simmer #onion </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"

Jamie and Hugh are great but after that you need to go back to Floyd and Fanny to keep me happy.  However, things changed last week when I  saw the Fabulous Baker Brothers [Channel 4 UK].  Fresh lively presentation with relatively complex food, simply explained and cooked. I am a convert.  \n\nCassoulet is typical of [[Aquitaine]], South West [[France]], though can probably be found throughout Southern France.  In French shops and markets you would find the [[Beans|beans]] in [[Kilner]]-type jars, sealed with a layer of [[Duck fat|duck fat]] rather than being sold in tins.\n\nI have adjusted the quantities, cooking temperatures and times from both the tv program and the Channel 4 recipe, see [[Talk:Duck and sausage cassoulet| the comments page]] for my reasons.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| [[Olive oil]]\n| 6 [[Toulouse sausages]] (about 400g)\n| 4 [[Duck|duck]] legs\n| 6 rashers of [[Pancetta|pancetta]]\n| 2 x 400g cans of peeled [[Plum tomatoes|plum tomatoes]], chopped\n| 1 bulb of [[Garlic|garlic]], unpeeled and cut in two\n|* ''When I cut my bulb in two, a lot of the outer skin came away so I actually removed most of it.''\n| 2 medium [[Red onions|red onions]], peeled and thinly sliced\n| 1 large [[Red chilli|red chilli]], slit lengthwise\n| 3 sprigs of [[Thyme|thyme]]\n| [[Sea Salt|sea salt]] and [[Freshly ground black pepper|freshly ground black pepper]]\n| 500 ml [[Chicken stock|chicken stock]]\n| A good splash of [[White wine|white wine]]\n| 2 x 400g cans [[Cannellini beans|cannellini beans]], well rinsed in cold water and drained\n| 2 tablespoons of [[Sherry vinegar|sherry vinegar]]\n| 1 [[French baguette]], torn into small pieces\n\n}}\n\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n* Preheat the oven to 200\u00b0 C (400\u00b0 F - gas 6), [fan oven 180\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:The Fabulous Baker Brothers cassoulet pre bread.jpg|The Fabulous Baker Brothers cassoulet, ready for the bread\nImage:The Fabulous Baker Brothers cassoulet tight fit.jpg|This is the largest roasting tray I have and I could only get 400 ml of stock in it!\nImage:The Fabulous Baker Brothers cassoulet fryin tray.jpg|Use the roasting tray like a huge frying pan\nImage:The Fabulous Baker Brothers cassoulet ingredients.jpg|The ingredients\n</gallery>\n\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Pour a splash of olive oil into a large roasting pan on a hob at a high heat.  Add a grind of [[black pepper]], add the duck and sausages and use it like a huge frying pan to brown the meat.  This may take 10 to 15 minutes.\n| Remove the browned meat and set to one side.\n|Slit the chilli length-wise but don't disturb the seeds.\n| With the heat still on, add the herbs, chilli, onions, pancetta, garlic bulb halves, cut side down.  Season with salt and pepper and fry for 5 minutes, stirring now and then.\n| [[De-glaze]] the pan with the wine and the sherry vinegar.\n| Add the beans and chopped tomatoes and mix well.\n| Arrange the duck and sausages on the top, duck skin-side up.  Pour over the chicken stock and jiggle the roasting tray to bed everything down.\n| Roast uncovered for 1.5 hours, checking a few times to see that it's not drying out. ''see [[Talk:Duck and sausage cassoulet|comments]]''\n| After 1.5 hours, tear the baguette into small pieces and push into the tray so that the bread soaks up all the fat and juices.\n| Return to the oven and roast for 30 minutes more.\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nOn the TV program they suggested serving with a green salad. I'm not sure that would work very well. We found it fine on its own, though it might be nice with some boiled broccoli.\n===Variations===\n* Instead of [[pancetta]], use 200 g [[dry cured bacon]] or [[lardons]]\n* Use dry [[Sherry|sherry]] or even [[red wine]] instead of [[white wine]]\n* Use 1 cup (450g / 1lb) dried cannellini beans though they will need soaking overnight, rinsing and boiling in unsalted water for 1 to 1.5 hours before they can be added at the same stage as the canned beans.\n* I added a few ''interesting'' [[dried chillies]] instead of the large fresh red chilli.\n* My fresh thyme is a little past its best so I made a [[bouquet garni]] of some [[thyme]], [[bay leaves]] and a little [[cutting celery]]\n==See also==\n* [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:English_television_chefs Television chefs (Wikipedia)]\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:French recipes]]\n[[Category:Historic recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Spicy recipes]]\n[[Category:Chilli pepper recipes]]\n[[Category:Garlic recipes]]\n[[Category:Grain and bean recipes]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:Pork recipes]]\n[[Category:Poultry recipes]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#duckandsausagecassoulet #pancetta #thyme #whitewine #driedchillies #lardons #sherry #kilner #plumtomatoes #unusualrecipes #redwine </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"

The [[Salt|salt]] seems to make it easy to remove the skin and keeps the [[Fish|fish]] really moist - it's also quite an impressive looking dish. We bought most of the ingredients from the local fishmonger who strangely, looked exactly like Poseidon himself!\n\nDon't be worried about the amount of [[Salt|salt]] used, it sticks to (and helps to remove) the skin and does not make the dish the least bit salty. The large [[Grains|grains]] of coarse [[Sea Salt|sea salt]] don't seem to permeate the [[Fish|fish]]. In [[France]], [[Sel gris]], the grey coloured [[Sea salt|sea salt]] is cheap and easily available in all supermarkets, that won't be the case in the UK unfortunately.\n  \nYou really do need coarse [[sea salt]] for this recipe, and quite a lot.  I've heard of 'the careful' using dishwasher salt for this though I would read the packaging very carefully first!\n<gallery widths=270px heights=270px perrow=5>\nImage:Lemon and parsley sauce.jpg|[[Lemon and parsley sauce]], simple, quick and effective\nImage:Fish in salt, baked.jpg|[[Baked|baked]] after 25 minutes\nImage:Two bream baked in sea salt recipe.jpg|Layer two, the second [[bream]] added.

I will not pay good coin for a measly bunches of supermarket herbs so added three tablespoons of [[fennel seed]] to the [[sea salt]].  It was a good substitute, though fresh herbs would be better.\n===Chef's notes===\nI used 2 small [[bream]] instead of 1 large [[sea bass]] this time, both in the same salt-dish. It presents much better with just one fish - hence the lacking photographs!\n\nVery recently I saw Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall cooking [[seabass]] in salt, he used a few kilograms of normal table salt, cleverly dampened down with little water to make a firm 'cement'.  Using this method packed the salt around his sea bass on a flat tray, rather like a jelly-mould of yester-year. It made a great table presentation.  I will try this next time.\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:French recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Fish recipes]]\n[[Category:Sea fish recipes]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#fish #fishbakedinseasalt #seabass #bream #dill #sauce #fennel #lemon #parsley #france #bakingtray </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"

Excellent [[Bread|bread]] for tearing and dunking.\n\nSee 'Variations' below for instructions on how to partially make this in a [[Breadmaker|breadmaker]].\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 10g fresh [[Yeast|yeast]]\n| 350g [[Sparkling mineral water|sparkling mineral water]]\n| 500g strong [[Bread|bread]] [[Flour|flour]] - you may need to use more water if using very strong bread [[Flour|flour]]\n| 10g [[Salt|salt]]\n| [[Polenta]] for dusting\n\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| The night before you want to [[Bake|bake]] the [[Bread|bread]], dissolve the [[Yeast|yeast]] in the water,\n| [[Sieve]] 250g [[Flour|flour]] into a large bowl and stir in the water and dissolved [[Yeast|yeast]]. Do NOT add the [[Salt|salt]] at this stage as its will interfere with yeast activity.\n| Mix thoroughly.\n| Cover with [[Clingfilm|clingfilm]] and leave at room temperature overnight.\n| If it becomes very active, [[Refrigerate|refrigerate]] and bring to room temperature in the morning.\n| The next day, [[Sieve|sieve]] the remaining 250g [[Flour|flour]] with the [[Salt|salt]] and add to the bowl.\n| Mix thoroughly and leave to rest for 20 minutes. \n| The [[Dough|dough]] should be fairly sticky, so add more water if necessary. \n| [[Knead]], using your desired method until you have an elastic [[Dough|dough]]. \n| Shape into a ball and leave it to rest for an hour in an oiled bowl, covered with [[Clingfilm|clingfilm]], until the [[Dough|dough]] has almost doubled in size.\n| Lightly [[Flour|flour]] a work surface with the [[polenta]] and gently deflate the [[Dough|dough]].  \n| [[Knead]] briefly and repeat the two previous steps, but do not vigorously deflate the [[Dough|dough]].\n| Divide into 4 equal pieces and shape into rectangles.\n| Make a large diagonal cut from the top right to the bottom left corner, without cutting into the corners.\n| Make at 3 or 4 diagonal cuts on each side of the first cut, again, without cutting right through to the edge.\n| Using your fingers, open the cuts right out.\n| Make sure the holes as are large as they will close up during [[Baking|baking]] and could converge ~(as mine did - see image above).\n| Slide onto a floured peel and then onto your [[Baking stone|baking stone]] or a floured [[Baking|baking]] sheet.\n| [[Bake]] at 230\u00b0 C (450\u00b0 F - gas 8), [fan [[Oven|oven]] 210\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour] for 10-15 minutes until golden [[Brown|brown]].\n| Allow to cool on a wire rack.\n}}\n===Chef's notes===\nYou can do stages 6-12 in a [[Breadmaker|breadmaker]], using the longest [[Dough|dough]] setting.   If you not making a sponge, then you can just add all the ingredients to the machine at the beginning.  You will also need to use just under a sachet of fast-action [[yeast]].\nFor the Panasonic SD253 breadmaker, use the French dough setting,  for the [[Panasonic SD-ZB2502 automatic breadmaker]], use menu potion 08 French dough setting.\nPanasonic SD-ZB2502 automatic breadmaker\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:French recipes]]\n[[Category:Bread and baking]]\n[[Category:Vegan recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes]]\n[[Category:Breadmaker recipes]][[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#dough #yeast #flour #fougasse #bread #bake #baking #sieve #polenta #clingfilm #knead </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"

When the [[Curds|curds]] are firm, turn upside-down and continue draining.

After discovering the top shelf of my often-opened fridge could be as much as 5\u00b0 C warmer than the bottom, I've decided to mature my cheeses there.  As all fridges differ, check various areas of your fridge with a thermometer to find the area that is around 11\u00b0C [51\u00b0 F], the ideal 'cave' temperature.\n}}\n===Chef's notes===\nWhen trying to stabilise the temperature, take your time and don't rush or you will almost certainly overheat the [[Milk|milk]] and spoil your [[Cheese|cheese]].\n\nIt's quite useful, once you think you have stabilised the [[Milk|milk]] at a certain temperature, to leave if for 30 minutes and then check the temperature again before starting your [[Cheese making|cheese making]].\n\nDusting with [[Salt|salt]]:  I find that I use less salt but get a more even covering if I dust with salt that has been [[Ground|ground]] to a very fine powder in a [[Coffee grinder|coffee grinder]] first.\n\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes|Camembert cheese]]\n[[Category:Cheese making|Camembert cheese]]\n[[Category:French recipes|Camembert cheese]]\n[[Category:Cheese recipes|Camembert cheese]]\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#doublecream #dried #freeze #mould #fat #cheese #homemadecamembertcheese #curd #curds #frenchrecipescamembertcheese #cutthecurds </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"

This was purely because I had 'lost' the normal blade - which I eventually realised was still in the [[Ballymaloe brown bread]] that I had made the day before!

It can be added early in a dish for a mellow flavour, added at the very end of the cooking to provide a garlicky jolt, or even used raw as a garnish.\n\nA classic French bistro dish is [[Pommes persillade]], basically cubed [[potatoes]] fried in small amount of oil, with persillade added at the end of the cooking.

Some more modern versions of the recipe include [[Grated|grated]] [[Parmesan|parmesan]], [[Pecorino|pecorino]] or similar hard [[Cheeses|cheeses]]. Traditionally, the ingredients are crushed and mixed together in a mortar with a pestle, (pistou means pounded in the French Proven\u00e7al language). The word \"Pistou\" is an introduction from Genoa dialect \"[[Pesto]]\" as it has been brought in Provence in 19 th century by Italian immigrants from Genoa and Ligury ( 30 % of Provence population are of italian origin).\n===Pistou & Pesto===\nThe key difference between pistou and [[pesto]] is the absence of pinoli ([[Pine nuts|pine nuts]]), from pistou.\n===Pistou: uses===\nIt is a typical [[Condiment|condiment]] from the Provence region of [[France]] and from [[Italian]] regions that can be served with [[Pasta dishes|pasta dishes]] or as a spread for [[Bread|bread]].\n\nIt is most often associated with the Proven\u00e7al dish [[soupe au pistou]] or minestrone al pesto (Ligury)\nBoth pistou and [[Pesto|pesto]] probably share the same origins. The Roman poet Virgil describes a [[Sauce|sauce]] of crushed [[Herbs|herbs]], [[Garlic|garlic]], [[Salt|salt]], and [[Olive oil|olive oil]].  A version with pinoli emerged around Genoa to become pesto, while pistou evolved in the areas around Nice.\n\nSome regions, especially those closer to the Alps, substitute [[Swiss cheese]] in the place of [[Parmesan]]. Whatever [[Cheese|cheese]] is used, it is preferred that it not be a \"stringy\" cheese, so that when it melts in a hot liquid (like in the pistou [[Soup|soup]], for instance) it does not melt into long strands.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| A big handful of fresh [[Basil leaves|basil leaves]]\n| 1 [[Fat|fat]] Clove of [[Garlic|garlic]], peeled and crushed\n| 100ml (4fl oz) [[Extra virgin olive oil|extra virgin olive oil]]\n| [[Sea Salt|sea salt]] and [[Freshly ground black pepper|freshly ground black pepper]]\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| [[Blanch]] the [[Basil leaves|basil leaves]] in a pan of [[Boiling|boiling]] water for 5-10 seconds.\n| Drain and rinse under cold water.\n| Drain and carefully press out any excess water.\n| Blitz the [[Garlic|garlic]] and [[Basil|basil]] in a [[Food processor|food processor]] (using the smallest bowl available).\n| Blend to a pur\u00e9e, adding the [[Olive oil|olive oil]], slowly, a little at a time.\n| Season to taste.\n| [[Refrigerate|Refrigerate]] in a [[Lock and Lock|lock and lock]]-style container until required.\n}}\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Ingredients]]\n[[Category:Condiments]]\n[[Category:Garlic recipes]]\n[[Category:French recipes]]\n[[Category:Accompaniments]]\n[[Category:Dips and sauces]]\n[[Category:Soup and stock recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegan recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes]]\n[[Category:Uncooked]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#pistousauce #garlic #pesto #oliveoil #sauce #basil #parmesan #basilleaves #cheese #cheeses #herbs </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"

(cooking term)==\n\nRoux (pronounced somewhat like the English word \"rue\") is a mixture of [[wheat flour]] and [[fat]]. It is the basis of three of the mother sauces of classical French cooking: [[sauce b\u00e9chamel]], [[sauce velout\u00e9]], and [[sauce espagnole]]. [[Butter]], [[vegetable oils]], or [[lard]] are common fats used. It is used as a base for gravy, other sauces, souffl\u00e9s, [[:Category:Soup and stock recipes|soups and stews]].\n\nThe [[fat]] is heated in a pot or pan melting it if necessary, then the [[flour]] is added. The mixture is stirred until the [[flour]] is incorporated and then cooked until at least the point where a raw flour taste is no longer apparent or until desired colour has been reached. The final results can range from the nearly white to the nearly black, depending on the length of time it is over the heat, and its intended use. The end result is a thickening and flavouring agent.\n\nRoux is most often made with butter as the [[fat]] base but it may be made with any edible fat. In the case of meat gravies, they are often made with rendered fat from the meat. In regional American cuisine, bacon is sometimes fried to produce fat to use in the roux. [[Vegetable oil]] is often used when producing dark roux as it does not burn at high temperatures like [[butter]] will.\n\nWhen combining roux with water-based liquids, such as soup or [[milk]], it is important that these liquids are not excessively hot. It is preferable to add room temperature or warm liquid into a moderately hot or warm roux. They should be added in small quantities to the roux while stirring, to ensure proper mixing. Otherwise, the mixture will be very lumpy, not homogeneous, and not properly thickened.\n\nCooks can cheat by adding a mixture of water and [[wheat flour]] to a dish which needs thickening since the heat of boiling water will release the starch from the flour, however this temperature is not high enough to eliminate the floury taste. A mixture of water and flour used in this way is colloquially known as cowboy roux since it imparts a flavour to the finished dish which a traditional haute cuisine chef would consider unacceptable.\n\n==Types of roux==\nIn classic French cuisine there are three types of roux:\n\n'''Brown roux''' is used to thicken [[sauces]] such as [[Sauce espagnole|Espagnole]].  It is traditionally made in the oven with equal amount of [[clarified butter]] and [[flour]] and is cooked gently in the oven for a long time, stirring frequently.  Nowadays it is usually made in a saucepan on the hob over a low heat for about 10 minutes.  It can also be made with clarified [[fat]] from a 'petite marmite'.  It should be of a good light brown colour and keeps fairly well.\n\n'''Blond roux''' is made only with equal quantities of [[clarified butter]] and [[flour]] and is cooked more quickly than '''brown roux'''.  It is only made as when needed and should be pale gold in colour.\n\n'''White roux''' is used for [[B\u00e9chamel sauce| B\u00e9chamel]] and [[Sauce velout\u00e9|Velout\u00e9]] sauces and special thick soups.  Equal quantities of [[clarified butter]] and [[flour]] are cooked over heat for 5 minutes, constantly stirred with a wooden spoon.\n{{Template:WhatLinksHere}}\n{{CategoryLineIngredients}}\n[[Category:Ingredients]]\n[[Category:Dips and sauces|Roux]]\n[[Category:French recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:12032020'>#roux #flour #fat #clarifiedbutter #wheatflour #butter #sauceespagnole #vegetableoils #sauces #lard #vegetableoil </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"

This Basque area of SouthWestern France is the origin of Salade Landaise.  Fresh produce is abundant and easy to obtain, every town has weekly, even daily markets selling fresh produce from local farms.  The many versions of Salade Landaise we had were never the same, but always a fabulous selection of the best produce available at that time in the season.\n\nIn my attempt to reproduce this recipe, I've picked a selection of what was available in our local supermarket, and what we had growing at home.  It's probably not authentic, but not unlike many we've had over the years.\n\nI've listed some of the key ingredients you're likely to find in an authentic Salade Landaise, but never all at the same time!   \n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 1 cold cooked duck breast - this was cooked sous-vide, but any cooking method would be fine\n| 70g [2.5oz] selection of thinly sliced cold meats, smoked ham, bacon, Bayonne ham etc.\n| A small head of Romaine lettuce or Cos lettuce.

Proper gravy - well worth the effoert.</span>\n \n<span class=\"reviewAuthor\"> [[User:TheJudge|The Judge]] </span></span>\n}}\nIn cooking, espagnole [[sauce]] is one of the mother [[sauces]] that are the basis of sauce-making in classic French cooking. Auguste Escoffier codified the recipe in the late 19th century, which is still followed today.\n\nEven though espagnole is the French word for Spanish, the sauce has little connection with Spanish cuisine. According to Louis Diat, the creator of [[vichyssoise]] and the author of the classic Gourmet's Basic French Cookbook: \"There is a story that explains why the most important basic brown [[sauce]] in French cuisine is called sauce espagnole, or Spanish sauce. According to the story, the Spanish cooks of Louis XIII's bride, Anne, helped to prepare their wedding feast, and insisted upon improving the rich brown [[sauce]] of France with Spanish [[tomatoes]]. This new sauce was an instant success, and was gratefully named in honour of its creators.\"\n\nEspagnole has a strong taste and is rarely used directly on food. As a mother [[sauce]], however, it then serves as the starting point for many derivative sauces, such as Sauce Africaine, Sauce Bigarade, Sauce Bourguignonne, Sauce aux Champignons, Sauce Charcutiere, Sauce Chasseur, Sauce Chevreuil and Demi-glace. There are hundreds of other derivatives in the classic French repertoire.\n\nA typical espagnole recipe takes many hours or even several days to make, and produces four to five quarts of sauce. In most derivative recipes, however, one cup of espagnole is more than enough, so that the basic recipe will yield enough [[sauce]] for 16 to 20 meals. [[Frozen]] in small quantities, espagnole will keep practically indefinitely.  The following recipe is for a much smaller quantity.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| 25g unsalted [[butter]]\n| 1 tbsp [[ham]], finely diced\n| 1 large [[carrot]], peeled and diced\n| 1 [[onion]], finely chopped\n| 1 stick [[celery]], finely chopped\n| 2 tbsps [[mushrooms]], chopped\n| 1 [[bay leaf]]\n| 1 sprig [[thyme]]\n| 25g plain [[flour]]\n| 1 litre strong [[meat]] [[stock]], heated\n| 600g tinned, chopped [[tomatoes]] or use the equivalent in fresh if they are ripe enough\n| Seasoning\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| Melt half of the [[butter]] in a heavy pan.\n| Saut\u00e9 the [[ham]], [[carrot]], [[onion]], [[celery]], [[mushrooms]] and the [[herbs]] for about 20-30 minutes until they are soft and slightly caramelised.\n| Remove from the pan and reserve.\n| Melt the remaining [[butter]], add the [[flour]] and stir until the mixture becomes nut brown.\n| Remove from the heat and stir in a little [[stock]].\n| Return the [[flour]] mixture to the heat and gradually stir in the remaining [[stock]] until smooth.\n| Bring to the boil, add the reserved [[vegetables]] and the [[tomatoes]]. \n| Bring to the boil again and reduce the heat.\n| Simmer (it should not bubble) very gently for 2-3 hours until the [[sauce]] has reduced by half.\n| Skim from time to time.\n| Allow to cool slightly, then strain through muslin.\n| Put a few small pieces of [[butter]] over the top to prevent a skin forming.\n}}\n\n===Variations===\nThere are some derivative recipes which call for this to be [[fish]] based, in which case substitute the [[meat]] [[stock]] for [[fish]] stock.\n\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:French recipes]]\n[[Category:Dips and sauces]]\n[[Category:Boiled or simmered]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#sauce #sauceespagnole #butter #stock #flour #tomatoes #mushrooms #ham #carrot #celery #onion </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"

This is based on a recipe in  Richard Berthinet's '''[[Dough]]''' (ISBN 9781856267625).  I have started by making an overnight sponge, to encourage [[Yeast|yeast]] activity, but you can omit that stage if you like and mix in all the ingredients at the same time.\n\nThis time, I am letting my Kenwood Chef do a lot of the hard work.  If using a stand food [[Mixer|mixer]], you can use its bowl right from starting the sponge.  For a Kenwood Chef, you can use the bowl cover that comes with it, rather than mess about with [[Clingfilm|clingfilm]].   I am not sure if Kitchen Aids come with a clip on cover, so if they don't you will have to remove the bowl from the machine and cover with clingfilm or a damp cloth.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 10g fresh [[Yeast|yeast]]\n| 350g [[Sparkling mineral water|sparkling mineral water]]\n| 500g strong [[Bread|bread]] [[Flour|flour]] - you may need to use more water if using very strong bread [[Flour|flour]]\n| 10g [[Salt|salt]]\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| The night before you want to [[Bake|bake]] the [[Bread|bread]], dissolve the [[Yeast|yeast]] in the water,\n| [[Sieve]] 250g [[Flour|flour]] into a large bowl and stir in the water and dissolved [[Yeast|yeast]]. Do NOT add the [[Salt|salt]] at this stage as its will interfere with yeast activity.\n| Mix thoroughly.\n| Cover with [[Clingfilm|clingfilm]] and leave at room temperature overnight.\n| If it becomes very active, [[Refrigerate|refrigerate]] and bring to room temperature in the morning.\n| The next day, [[Sieve|sieve]] the remaining 250g [[Flour|flour]] with the [[Salt|salt]] and add to the bowl.\n| Mix thoroughly (Kenwood Chef - lowest speed for 2 minutes) and leave to rest for 20 minutes. The [[Dough|dough]] should be fairly sticky, so add more water if necessary. \n| [[Knead]], using your desired method until you have an elastic [[Dough|dough]]  (Kenwood - 2nd slowest speed for 6 minutes).\n| Shape into a ball and leave it to rest for an hour in an oiled bowl, covered with [[Clingfilm|clingfilm]], until the [[Dough|dough]] has almost doubled in size.\n| Lightly [[Flour|flour]] a work surface and gently deflate the [[Dough|dough]].  (Kenwood - deflate for a few seconds on slowest speed - no need for further [[Kneading|kneading]].)\n| [[Knead]] briefly and repeat the two previous steps, but do not vigorously deflate the [[Dough|dough]].\n| Divide into 4 equal pieces and allow to rest, covered, on the work surface.\n| Shape each piece into [[Baguettes|baguettes]] and place on a floured couche cloth or [[Baguette|baguette]] tin.\n| Cover and leave to prove for about 45 minutes until almost doubled in size.\n| Cover with a damp cloth or oiled [[Clingfilm|clingfilm]] and leave to prove for up to 45 minutes.\n| Make a few diagonal slashes in the loaves and leave to rest for a further 10 minutes\n| [[Bake]] at 230\u00b0 C (450\u00b0 F - gas 8), [fan [[Oven|oven]] 210\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour] for 15 minutes.\n| Allow to cool on a wire rack.\n}}\n===Chef's notes===\nI am still trying to get the knack of slashing the [[Dough|dough]]!\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:French recipes]]\n[[Category:Bread and baking]]\n[[Category:Vegan recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes]]\n[[Category:Breadmaker recipes]][[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#dough #flour #clingfilm #yeast #smallbaguettes #knead #bread #baguettes #bake #sieve #kneading </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
