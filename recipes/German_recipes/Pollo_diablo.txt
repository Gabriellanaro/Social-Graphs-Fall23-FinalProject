If it is too diabolical, stir in 1-2 [[Dessert|dessert]] spoons of [[Creme fraiche|cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche]].\n| Remove the lid and continue to apply heat to remove excess moisture.\n| Leave the [[Sauce|sauce]] to cool \n}}\n''' Constructing the strudels'''\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Beat the [[Egg|egg]] in a cup or small bowl.\n| Divide the [[Pastry|pastry]] into two equal halves and repeat the following steps for each half.\n| Roll out the [[Pastry|pastry]] to an oblong approximately 20*30cm (dust the rolling surface and the [[Rolling pin|rolling pin]] with a little [[Plain flour|plain flour]] to make sure it does not stick)\n| Make about 12 parallel cuts from each long edge to  approximately one third of the width.\n| Lay 6 slices of [[Ham|ham]] on top of the [[Pastry|pastry]], they should overlap each other.\n| Spread the cooled [[Sauce|sauce]] on top of the [[Ham|ham]] (not too much, you need to be able to wrap the strudel up.\n| First fold over the [[Ham|ham]] so that the [[Sauce|sauce]] is covered.\n| Fold in each end of [[Pastry|pastry]].\n| Now starting at one end, fold over alternate [[Pastry|pastry]] strips from the left and right.\n| [[Brush]] the top of the [[Pastry|pastry]] strips with [[Egg|egg]] to aid adhesion.\n| Now fold over the remaining [[Pastry|pastry]] strips so they overlap the first set.\n| Place the finished strudel on the [[baking tray]] (preferably on a sheet of [[Grease-proof paper|grease-proof paper]]).\n| [[Brush]] the strudel all over with [[Egg|egg]].\n}}\n''' Cooking the strudels'''\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Preheat the [[Oven|oven]] to 180C.\n| Place the [[baking tray]] in the centre of the [[Oven|oven]].\n| Cook for 25 minutes or until golden [[Brown|brown]].\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nEach strudel should serve two people (or more if you are serving it as a buffet dish).\n\nServe with a fresh [[Salad|salad]], [[Creme fraiche|cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche]] and [[Guacamole|guacamole]]. \n===Variations===\nThe same strudel construction technique can be applied to many different fillings. Use your own imagination.\n\nMy personal favourites are:\n* [[Poached|poached]] [[Salmon steaks|salmon steaks]]. [[Grill]] the steaks first with [[Cayenne pepper|cayenne pepper]] or cajun [[Spices|spices]], but use [[Smoked salmon|smoked salmon]] instead of [[Ham|ham]] for the lining\n* a [[Game|game]] variant using [[Venison|venison]], [[Mushrooms|mushrooms]] and [[Onions|onions]] with [[Cumberland sauce|cumberland sauce]] instead of [[Chilli|chilli]] [[Sauce|sauce]].\n* If you find the whole idea of rolling out [[Pastry|pastry]] and constructing strudels too daunting, then use the [[Sauce|sauce]] instead to fill enchiladas. Grate [[Cheese|cheese]] over the top and cook them for about 15-20 minutes. Serve with [[Guacamole|guacamole]] and [[Creme fraiche|cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche]]. \n===Chef's notes===\nI tend to make 3 or 4 strudels at a time, and since I live alone they last me a few days (meaning I do not need to cook in the week). They keep very well for a few days (in the [[Fridge|fridge]]) and portions can be reheated if wrapped loosely in aluminium [[Foil|foil]] and placed in a preheated [[Oven|oven]] (180C) for 20 minutes. \n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes|Chicken]]\n[[Category:Austrian recipes]]\n[[Category:German recipes]]\n[[Category:Swiss recipes]]\n[[Category:Chilli pepper recipes|Chicken]]\n[[Category:Pies tarts and flans|Chicken]]\n[[Category:Poultry recipes|Chicken]]\n[[Category:Pan fried]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#sauce #pastry #egg #onions #chicken #ham #pollodiablo #chilli #bellpeppers #fry #saute </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
