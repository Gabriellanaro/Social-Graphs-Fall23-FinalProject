This is a basic recipe that produces a tangy sauerkraut with live bacteria. \n\nDon't seal the jar until [[fermentation]] is complete as it may explode!\n\nNo cooking is required.\n\nWe have a recipe for a similar dish; [[Curtido]], a pickled relish from El Salvador and also a [[Spicy pickled cabbage|spicy pickled red cabbage recipe.]]\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 1 large (2.5 kg - 5 lb) fresh white [[cabbage]]\n| 2-3 tablespoons [[sea salt]]\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Clean and dry a large (3 litre) preserves jar and any bowls or work surfaces that you will be using\n| Quarter the [[cabbage]] and remove the core\n| Slice the [[cabbage]] finely or thickly, as you prefer.  A [[food processor]] is good for this\n| Layer the [[cabbage]] in the preserves jar,  sprinkling salt in between layers\n| Pack tightly into the jar, leaving 1cm space at the top\n| Juice should rise to top of jar as you tightly pack the [[cabbage]] in; if not, add a little bottled water\n| Don't seal the jar while it is [[fermenting]], as it will build up gas pressure and might break. Just cover with a cloth, or [[cling-wrap]]\n| The [[sauerkraut]] will be fermented in about a week. Wipe any excess liquid from around the jar, and put the lid on tightly before moving it to a cool place (e.g. the [[refrigerator]]) to mature. It is ready to eat after the first week, but will improve with age and as the bacteria slowly consume the more complex sugars in the cabbage\n}}\n===Variations===\n\n'''Add any of the following:'''\n* [[juniper berries]]\n* [[onion]]\n* [[chili]]\n* grated [[carrot]]\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Accompaniments]]\n[[Category:Dips and sauces]]\n[[Category:Pickles and preserves]]\n[[Category:Salad recipes]]\n[[Category:Starters]]\n[[Category:German recipes]]\n[[Category:Tex-Mex recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegetable recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegan recipes]]\n[[Category:Uncooked]][[Category:Pickled]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#cabbage #sauerkraut #fermenting #curtido #pickled #onion #foodprocessor #fermentation #refrigerator #litres #sauerkrautrecipe </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
