Please take the trouble to read Pat's page - it is fascinating!\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 4 tablespoons [[Olive oil|olive oil]] \n| 2 medium [[Onions|onions]], coarsely chopped \n| 8 Cloves [[Garlic|garlic]], chopped \n| 3 [[Turnips|turnips]], peeled and chopped \n| 2 cups [455 ml] [[Brown|brown]] [[Lentils|lentils]], washed and picked over \n| &frac12;  cup [115 ml] [[Parsley|parsley]], chopped fine \n| 6-8 cups [1360 ml - 1820 ml] water \n| 2 [[Bay leaves|bay leaves]] \n| &frac12;  teaspoon [[Thyme|thyme]], rubbed through your palms \n| [[Salt]] and [[Pepper|pepper]], to taste \n| 4 tablespoons strong [[Red wine vinegar|red wine vinegar]] \n| 4 [[Scallions|scallions]] [[Spring onions|(spring onions)]], chopped \n| 2 [further] tablespoons [[Olive oil|olive oil]]\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Heat the [[Oil|oil]] over medium heat in a large [[Soup|soup]] pot, then scrape in the [[Onions|onions]], [[Garlic|garlic]], and [[Turnip|turnip]] and saut\u00e9 until the onions are translucent. \n| Stir in the [[Lentils|lentils]] and saut\u00e9 for several more minutes. \n| Stir in the [[Parsley|parsley]], then pour in the water, add the [[Bay leaves|bay leaves]], rub the [[Thyme|thyme]] into the pot, and season to taste with [[Salt|salt]] and [[Pepper|pepper]]. \n| Bring to a [[Boil|boil]], then reduce heat to a [[Simmer|simmer]], cover, and cook for an hour and a half. \n| When ready to serve, stir in the [[Vinegar|vinegar]] and let cook for a minute. \n| Ladle into bowls, top each with the chopped scallions [[Spring onions|(spring onions)]], and drizzle with [[Olive oil|olive oil]]. Serve immediately.\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nPat says:  \u201cThe splash of strong red wine vinegar lifts this out of the category of plain fare into a whole new world. Its sharp sweetness and the spike of scallions counterpoint the creamy lentils and vegetables perfectly--it's a fine meal, especially with some bread, olives, and feta cheese on the side. Greek wine too, mmmmmmm.\u201d \n===Variations===\nBeing somewhat of an 'odomanti', I may well increase the [[Garlic|garlic]] quantity, when I make it myself.\n===Chef's notes===\nHave yet to try this [[Soup|soup]] but sounds great.  I am sure it will be best enjoyed whilst listening to an audio version of Aristophanes' ''Clouds''!  \n--[[User:JuliaBalbilla|JuliaBalbilla]] 19:09, 11 February 2009 (UTC)\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes|Lentil soup]]\n[[Category:Garlic recipes]]\n[[Category:Grain and bean recipes|Lentil soup]]\n[[Category:Greek recipes|Lentil soup]]\n[[Category:Historic recipes|Lentil soup]]\n[[Category:Soup and stock recipes|Lentil soup]]\n[[Category:Vegetable recipes|Lentil soup]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes|Lentil soup]]\n[[Category:Vegan recipes]]\n[[Category:Boiled or simmered]]\n[[Category:Pan fried]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#oliveoil #garlic #onions #soup #parsley #thyme #bayleaves #lentils #turnips #lentilsoup #turnip </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
