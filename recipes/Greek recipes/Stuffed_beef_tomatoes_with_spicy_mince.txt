An [[ice-cream scoop]] is good for this.\n| Keep about half of the tomato flesh, and all of the pips, place in a sieve to drain excess liquid.  Discard the rest.\n| In a large deep-sided [[Frying pan|frying pan]], heat the [[Olive oil|olive oil]] and add the [[Onion|onion]]. Cook gently till beginning to soften. Then add [[Garlic|garlic]], one pinch each of the [[Spices|spices]] and the [[Chillies|chillies]]. \n| Give it a good stir and then cook for a couple of minutes.\n| Tip in the [[Mince|mince]] and stir to break it all up. Add the remaining [[Spices|spices]], [[Tomato pur\u00e9e|tomato pur\u00e9e]], [[Belazu]] Rose [[Harissa]], [[Lemon juice|lemon juice]] and the [[Mint|mint]].\n| Mix then stir in the reserved [[Tomato|tomato]] flesh till all is combined. Cook gently for about 15 minutes until the mixture is fairly dry.\n| When cooked, taste and season with [[Salt|salt]] and [[Freshly ground black pepper|freshly ground black pepper]].\n| If the mixture has lots of fat, drain off any excess.\n| Sit the [[Tomatoes|tomatoes]] in a [[Roasting|roasting]] tin then spoon the mixture into each and pop the [[Tomato|tomato]] lid on. Add a tablespoon of sherry to each tomato.\n| Cover with [[Foil|foil]] and [[Bake|bake]] in the [[Oven|oven]] for 1 hour, then using a [[Slotted spoon|slotted spoon]], carefully transfer the [[Tomatoes|tomatoes]] to a serving plate.\n}}\n(''Prima Magazine'')\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Stuffed beef tomatoes with spicy mince roast.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Ready to bake\nImage:Stuffed beef tomatoes with spicy mince recipe.jpg|thumb|300px|right|A few baby home grown [[sweet peppers]] have been added as well\n</gallery>\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe with the Greek [[Yoghurt|yogurt]].\n===Variations===\nUse [[Sweet peppers|sweet peppers]] instead of [[Tomatoes|tomatoes]]\nUse [[Beef mince|beef mince]] instead of [[Lamb|lamb]] [[Mince|mince]]\nTry a variation of [[spices]] & [[herbs]].  [[Dried oregano]], ground [[cumin]] complement each other well.\n===Chef's notes===\nThe original recipe suggested baking onions with the tomatoes to add sweetness and 'help them stand-up'.  The sherry now adds the sweetness and if you want to ensure they 'stand-up' use a smaller roasting dish so they are a snug fit.\n\nThis amended recipe is now very nice indeed and will be made again!\n\n\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Beef recipes]]\n[[Category:Belazu recipes]]\n[[Category:Recipes from other sites]]\n[[Category:Greek recipes]]\n[[Category:Lamb recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:Starters]]\n[[Category:Tapas, mezze and antipasti]]\n[[Category:Spicy recipes]]\n[[Category:Favourite recipes]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\nThis recipe heavily adapted from a recipe, originally from the [http://www.mybelazu.com/recipes/all-recipes.html recipe section of Belazu.com]\nAll '''[[Belazu]]''' products shown can be [http://www.mybelazu.com/products/how-to-shop.html purchased online] or obtained from their network of stockists:\n* [http://www.mybelazu.com/products/where-to-buy-belazu-products.html UK Belazu stockists]\n* [http://www.mybelazu.com/products/where-to-buy-belazu-products-worldwide.html Worldwide Belazu stockists]\n<small>Many thanks to [[Belazu.com|Belazu]] for kindly giving Cookipedia [[Talk:Belazu.com|permission]] to use the recipes from [http://www.belazu.com their website].</small>\n\n\n===Belazu products used in this recipe===\n* [http://www.mybelazu.com/details/early-harvest.html Belazu Early Harvest Extra Virgin Olive Oil Unfiltered]\n* [http://www.mybelazu.com/details/rose-harissa.html Belazu Rose Harissa]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#stuffedbeeftomatoeswithspicymince #belazu #tomatoes #tomato #mint #spices #mince #onion #sweetpeppers #cumin #lamb </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
