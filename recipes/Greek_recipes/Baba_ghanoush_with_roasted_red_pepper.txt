Frequently the [[aubergine]] is [[baked]] or [[broiled]] over an open flame before peeling, so that the pulp is soft and has a smoky taste.\n\nBaba ghanoush is usually eaten as a dip with [[pita bread]], and is sometimes added to other dishes. It is usually of an earthy light brown colour.\n\nThe [[Baba ghanoush|original baba ghanoush recipe can be found here]], but I think this version is more interesting and has a degree of sweetness.\n\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 2 [[aubergines]]\n| Half a [[red pepper]]\n| 2 heaped tablespoons light [[tahini]]\n| 4 fat [[cloves garlic, peeled and crushed]]\n| 4 tablespoons of olive oil\n| 3 tablespoons [[yogurt]]\n| Juice and zest from half a [[lemon]] or [[lime]]\n| A good pinch of salt\n| A pinch of whole cumin seeds\n| 4 [[Pitta breads]] or [[crispbreads]]\n| A few olives, walnuts or [[toasted]] flaked [[almonds]] to garnish\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Brush the [[aubergines]] and the [[red pepper]] with a little olive oil and roast over a hot grill or [[barbecue]]  until the skins are well burnt\n| Turn them regularly, about 5 to 6 minutes a side will be fine.\n| You can also impale them on [[skewers]] (better metal than wooden ones) and roast them over the [[barbecue]], again turning often\n| Set them aside to cool, ideally in a sealed [[Lock & Lock]] box\n| Scoop out the soft flesh, discarding the outer skin but reserving some of the toasted sut surfaces.\n| Crush the garlic and saute in 4 tablespoons of [[olive oil]]. Don't let it burn.  At the last minute, add the whole cumin seeds.  Allow the oil to cool before processing.\n| Put the scooped flesh into a [[food processor]] together with the [[Garlic|garlic]],  [[yogurt]] and [[tahini]]. Season to taste with [[salt]]\n| Blend into a smooth paste and add the [[lemon]] zest and juice\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\n\nServe, garnished with olives and nuts, accompanied by warm [[pitta breads]] or [[crispbread]]\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Accompaniments]]\n[[Category:Garlic recipes]]\n[[Category:Greek recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:North African recipes]]\n[[Category:Salad recipes]]\n[[Category:Snacks and light bites]]\n[[Category:Tapas, mezze and antipasti]]\n[[Category:Turkish recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegetable recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes]]\n[[Category:Grilled, griddled or barbecued]]\n[[Category:Uncooked]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#pittabreads #aubergines #tahini #babaghanoushwithroastedredpepper #barbecue #redpepper #yogurt #lemon #aubergine #mashed #almonds </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
