This recipe has been adapted for cooking in a [[slow cooker]] and is a minimally altered version of [[Beef pastitsada]] (which is a Greek dish, hailing from Corfu).\n\nAs with any slow cooker recipe, the possibilities are endless.  Providing the meat and shallots are saut\u00e9ed and coloured and there is enough liquid to cook in, add what you fancy.  I had a little freezer clean-out and found some pre cooked [[kidney beans]], chopped [[sweet peppers]], [[celery]] moons and a bag of [[cherry tomatoes]] from last summer.  They will all add their own subtle flavours.  The [[kidney beans]] will add protein, helping us to bulk the meal out and allow us to use a little less meat than the original recipe\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 2 tablespoons [[Olive oil|olive oil]]\n| 400 g [[Braising steak]]\n| 12 [[Shallots|shallots]], peeled\n| 1 [[sweet pepper]], any colour, de-seeded and chopped\n| 250 ml [[Red wine|red wine]]\n| 3 medium carrots, peeled and cut into little finger-sized pieces.\n| 400 g [[kidney beans]] (canned or pre soaked and cooked [[dried beans]])\n| 10 medium-sized [[tomatoes]]\n| 1 teaspoon [[Ground allspice|ground allspice]]\n| 2.5 cm (1\") stick of cinnamon (to be removed before serving)\n| 2 large (400 g) cans tinned [[Tomatoes|tomatoes]], chopped\n| 3 [[Cloves garlic, peeled and crushed|cloves garlic, peeled and crushed]]\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| In a large [[frying pan]] or [[wok]], heat the [[Olive oil|olive oil]] and [[Brown|brown]] the [[Meat|meat]] for 5 minutes, remove and set to one side. Do this in small batches or you will just end up with [[Boiled|boiled]] [[Meat|meat]].\n| Add the [[Shallots|shallots]], [[garlic]] and [[sweet peppers]] to the pan and saut\u00e9 for 6 minutes to colour\n| Return the [[Beef|beef]] to the dish and [[Deglaze|deglaze]] the pan with the [[Wine|wine]] and a wooden spatula\n| Pour this and the remaining ingredients into the [[slow cooker]] pot and mix well\n| Slow cook for 3 to 4 hours on medium heat\n| Remove the cinnamon stick before serving.\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe hot with [[pasta]] or [[Noodles|noodles]] and fresh [[Green vegetables|green vegetables]] such as [[Broccoli|broccoli]] or [[Green beans|green beans]]\n===Chef's notes===\nThis dish could also be made with [[Veal|veal]], [[Chicken|chicken]] or even [[Lobster]].\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Beef recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:Poultry recipes]]\n[[Category:Veal recipes]]\n[[Category:Cooking with wine]]\n[[Category:Stewed, braised or pot roasted]]\n[[Category:Greek recipes]]\n[[Category:Slow cooker recipes]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#kidneybeans #cherrytomatoes #shallots #tomatoes #sweetpeppers #slowcooker #oliveoil #foodprocessor #unusualrecipes #veal #braisingsteak </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
