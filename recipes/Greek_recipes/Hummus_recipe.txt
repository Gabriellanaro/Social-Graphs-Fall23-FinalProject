I use much more normally.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 125 g (4 oz) [[Dried|dried]] [[Chickpeas|chickpeas]] or 1 large can of chickpeas [about 400g of cooked chickpeas] and omit the soaking stage.\n| [[Zest]] and [[Juice|juice]] of 1 [[Lemon|lemon]]\n| 2 tablespoons light [[Tahini|tahini]]\n| 2 Cloves [[Garlic|garlic]], peeled\n| 120 ml (4 fl oz) [[Olive oil|olive oil]]\n| [[Sea Salt|sea salt]] to taste\n}}\n\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n* Soak the [[Dried|dried]] [[Chickpeas|chickpeas]] for 24 hours in cold water, refreshing a few times if you can.\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n| ''If using canned [[chick peas]], just drain and rinse them with fresh water a few times and go directly to Adding them to the food processor step.''\n| Drain and rinse the soaked [[Chickpeas|chickpeas]].\n| Add to a large pan, cover with water. '''Do not add any [[Salt|salt]]''', otherwise the peas will not absorb the water properly. Bring to the [[Boil|boil]] and [[Simmer|simmer]] for 1 hour or until softened.  They may take a little longer depending on size and age. A pinch of [[baking soda]] (bicarbonate of soda) added to the cooking water will shorten the cooking time.\n| Drain, rinse and allow to cool.\n| Add to a [[Food processor|food processor]] with everything but the [[Olive oil|olive oil]]. Blend to a paste, then as if making [[Mayonnaise|mayonnaise]], gradually drizzle in the [[Olive|olive]] [[Oil|oil]] with the motor running.\n| Taste and adjust the seasoning if needed.  You can always add extra [[Garlic|garlic]] if needed.\n| Adjust the consistency by adding more oil if too thick or a handful of breadcrumbs if it is too liquid.\n}}\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Hummus recipe blending.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Blending the hummus\nImage:Chickpeas cooked.jpg|thumb|300px|right|500g of cooked chickpeas\n</gallery>\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe with [[Crispbread|crispbread]] or [[Pittas|pittas]].\n===Variations===\nOmit the [[Lemon juice|lemon juice]], [[Zest|zest]] and [[Salt|salt]]. Instead, add the rind of a quarter of a [[Preserved lemon|preserved lemon]] plus 2 tablespoons of the [[Preserved lemon juice|preserved lemon juice]]. [[Preserved lemon hummus|Bulk recipe here!]]. \n\nYou can also cook the chickpeas in a pressure cooker - [[Chickpeas#How_to_cook_chickpeas_in_a_pressure_cooker|details here]]\n===Variations===\nAny tinned beans or pulses work well in this recipe.
