This is the book he dedicated to the Australian Wildlife expert, Steve Irwin [Crocodile Hunter].\n\nThis meal will easily stretch to 3 days meals for two and by varying the accompaniments, should stay interesting.\n\n'''Follow-up:''' Not really that interesting after tasting it, in fact it was rather bland.  I think it would benefit from adding at least 4 or 5 cloves of crushed [[garlic]] at the onion stage.  The leftovers will be improved.\n\nDo make sure you discard lots of the rendered fat or it will be swimming in [[saturated fat]].\n{{Template:HC recipes}}\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 2 kg boneless [[Pork shoulder|pork shoulder]]\n| 2 large [[Red onions|red onions]], peeled and sliced finely\n| 2 heaped tablespoons of [[Smoked paprika powder|smoked paprika powder]]\n| 1 tablespoon of unsmoked [[Paprika powder|paprika powder]]\n| 2 teaspoons [[Caraway seeds|caraway seeds]]\n| Leaves [[Pickled|pickled]] from a bunch of fresh [[Marjoram|marjoram]] or [[Oregano|oregano]]\n| 1 teaspoon of [[Dried oregano|dried oregano]]\n| 6 [[Sweet peppers|sweet peppers]]\n| 5 fresh small [[Green Indian chillies|green Indian chillies]] or to taste\n| 1 x 400g tin of [[Tomatoes|tomatoes]], chopped\n| 4 tablespoons [[Red wine vinegar|red wine vinegar]]\n}}\n'''[[Sour cream]] accompaniment'''\n* 1 large pot of [[Sour cream|sour cream]]\n* [[Zest]] from 1 [[Lemon|lemon]]\n* Handful of fresh [[Parsley|parsley]], chopped finely\n\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n* Preheat the [[Oven|oven]] to 180\u00b0 C (350\u00b0 F - gas 4), [fan oven 160\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]\n===Method===\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Spicy pork and chilli-pepper goulash rosti broccoli.jpg|With [[rosti]] and [[broccoli]] and [[sour cream]] on the following day\nImage:Spicy pork and chilli-pepper goulash_cooked.jpg|Spicy pork and chilli-pepper goulash after 3.5 hours\nImage:Pork shoulder rendered.jpg|Pork shoulder after rendering\nImage:Spicy pork and chilli-pepper goulash_ingredients.jpg|Spicy pork and chilli-pepper goulash, the ingredients\n</gallery>\n{{RecipeMethod\n| If the [[Pork shoulder|pork shoulder]] has rind, slice it off and discard it.\n| Score the [[Fat|fat]] side of the [[Pork|pork]] in a criss-cross pattern.\n| Over a high heat, add a good glug of [[Olive oil|olive oil]] to an [[Oven-proof casserole dish|oven proof casserole dish]] and add a good grind of [[Black pepper|black pepper]]\n| Sprinkle the [[Fat|fat]] with a good pinch of [[Salt|salt]]\n| Lay the [[Pork|pork]] in the [[Oil|oil]], skin side down and heat for about 12 minutes, moving it about every few minutes.  Be careful, the [[Fat|fat]] can get very hot and it's easy to make it splash and spit.\n| Turn the [[Pork|pork]] over and seal the [[Meat|meat]] side for about 3 minutes.\n| Remove the [[Pork|pork]] from the dish and carefully discard about half (or more) of the [[Rendered|rendered]] [[Fat|fat]].\n| Add the [[Onions|onions]] and [[Caraway seeds|caraway seeds]] together with another grind of pepper and saut\u00e9 for about 10 minutes.\n| [[Deglaze]] the [[Casserole dish|casserole dish]] with the [[Red wine vinegar|red wine vinegar]] and add the [[Peppers|peppers]], [[Chillies|chillies]] and [[Paprika powder|paprika powder]].\n| Add the [[Meat|meat]] back to the dish, [[Fat|fat]]-side up and jiggle it about so it settles in the dish.\n| Add the tin of [[Tomatoes|tomatoes]] and about 200 ml of [[Boiling|boiling]] water which should be just enough to cover the [[Meat|meat]].\n| Bring to the [[Boil|boil]], cover and cook in the oven for about 3 hours 30 minutes by which time the [[Meat|meat]] should be falling apart, if it's not then cook it for a little longer.\n}}\n'''[[Sour cream]]'''\n# Stir the [[Lemon zest|lemon zest]] and chopped [[Parsley|parsley]] into the sour cream and serve in a bowl with the [[Pork|pork]].\n===Serving suggestions===\nWe plan to have this over three day, one day with [[Plain rice|plain rice]], one day with [[Cous-cous|couscous]] and another with [[Jacket potatoes|jacket potatoes]]\n\nTop the meat with a spoonful or two of the sour cream and add a pinch of smoked paprika for a final flourish.\n===Variations===\nThe authentic version would use red [[Chilli peppers|chilli peppers]], however I love the flavour of the [[Green Indian chillies|green Indian chillies]] and as they [[Freeze|freeze]] and are always to hand, I prefer them.\n\nOur fresh [[Marjoram|marjoram]] is not so very strong early in the year so I have added a teaspoon of [[Dried oregano|dried oregano]].\n===Chef's notes===\nFollow the [[RSPCA Think Pig Checklist]] to make sure that your [[Pork|pork]] has come from pigs that have been reared to higher welfare standards.\n* http://bit.ly/rspcathinkpig\n===Recipe source===\n* Jamie at home - Jamie Oliver, ISBN 0718152433\n==See also==\n* [[The renowned Mr Brown Pulled Pork - Oriental]]\n* [[Cochinita pibil]]\n* [[Beer pickled belly of pork]]\n* [[Pulled pork]]\n* [[Slow roast recipes]]\n* http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Irwin\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Hungarian recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Spicy recipes]]\n[[Category:Chilli pepper recipes]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:Pork recipes]]\n[[Category:Stews and casseroles]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]][[Category:Boiled or simmered]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#spicyporkandchillipeppergoulash #pork #fat #sourcream #driedoregano #porkshoulder #carawayseeds #marjoram #parsley #tomatoes #paprikapowder </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
