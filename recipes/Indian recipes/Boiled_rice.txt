Tasting regularly to check it's to your liking.\n\n===Chef's tip===\n\n[[Rice]] can be cooked before the meal is due to be served, providing it is properly stored and used the same day.  Allow the rice to cool and refrigerate until required. Microwave when needed, ensuring it is piping hot.  Do not reheat rice that is more than 1 day old or rice that may not have been properly stored.\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes|Rice]]\n[[Category:Indian recipes|Rice]]\n[[Category:Rice recipes|Rice]]\n[[Category:Accompaniments|Rice]]\n[[Category:Vegetable recipes|Rice]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes|Rice]]\n[[Category:Vegan recipes]]\n[[Category:Student recipes]]\n[[Category:Boiled or simmered]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#boiledrice #brownrice #indiancookery #basmatirice #rice #boiledorsimmered #sieve #thermomix </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
