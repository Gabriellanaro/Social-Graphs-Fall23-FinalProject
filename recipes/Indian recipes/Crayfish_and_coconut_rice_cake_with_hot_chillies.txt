[[Crayfish]] work exceptionally well in this recipe as they don't seem to dry out in the high heat.\n\nThe other roti recipes in the ''see also'' section were prepared in a frying pan.  This time I used a large [[grill tray]], a far better method.  It allows the rice to ''just'' crisp up a little, leaving very little stodgy rice.\n\nPlease be very careful if storing cooked [[Rice|rice]].  [[Refrigerate]] the moment it has cooled and use within 1 day\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 170 g uncooked [[basmati rice]].\n| 240 g Crayfish tails (2 packs)\n| 2 tablespoons [[Ghee|ghee]] or vegetable [[Oil|oil]]\n| 5 [[Fat|fat]] [[Garlic cloves, peeled and crushed|garlic cloves, peeled and crushed]]\n| 5 cm (2\") [[Ginger|ginger]], peeled and roughly [[Grated|grated]]\n| 75 g (5 oz) [[Onions|onions]], peeled and finely chopped\n| 1 fresh [[coconut]], flesh [[Grated|grated]] - don't be too precise with the grating, it's quite nice to have some meaty chunks mixed in.\n| 4 hot [[Chilli peppers|chilli peppers]] (2 red, 2 green), finely chopped - 2 with seeds, 2 partially deseeded worked very well for us. (quite spicy)\n}}\n'''spices'''\n\n''don't grind the spices, leave them whole''\n* 2 teaspoons whole [[coriander seeds]]\n* 1 teaspoon whole [[cumin seeds]] (white)\n* 1 teaspoon whole [[fenugreek seeds]]\n* 1 teaspoon [[turmeric powder]]\n'''to serve'''\n{{RecipeIngredientsNB| 6 small [[cherry tomatoes]], halved\n| 1 tablespoon [[Lime juice|lime juice]]\n| Fresh [[basil]] leaves, chopped or roughly torn.\n}}\n\n===[[Mise en place]]===\nPreheat your oven to 220\u00b0 C (425\u00b0 F - gas 7), [fan oven 200\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]\n\nPlace a lightly oiled baking tray in the top third of the oven\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Quickly wash and drain the [[rice]] but don't rinse it as you normally would, this dish is best with rice of a starchy consistency. \n| Cook in boiling water until it just has a little ''bite'' left.  About 7 to 11 minutes.\n| Rinse the cooked rice in cold water until it is cold.  Drain well.\n| Add the [[Rice|rice]] and the [[turmeric powder]] to a [[Food processor|food processor]] with a metal blade and blend to a thick creamy pur\u00e9e - adding a little milk if required to make it thinner.  Remember, the texture is not going to change much whilst being cooked and will remain at roughly the same consistency as it was when first mixed. \n| Heat the [[Ghee|ghee]] in a [[frying pan]] or [[Wok|wok]] and [[Stir-fry|stir-fry]] all of the whole [[Spices|spices]] for half a minute, then add the [[Ginger|ginger]] and [[Garlic|garlic]] and allow them to cook for a minute or so.\n| Add the [[Onion|onion]] and reduce the heat a little and let them cook until translucent; about 5 minutes.\n| Add a little more [[oil]] or [[ghee]] if the mixture looks dry.\n| Add the whole [[crayfish tails]], [[Coconut|coconut]] and [[Chilli|chillies]] to the [[Onions|onions]], mix well and immediately remove from the heat.\n| Add all of the ingredients, apart from the tomatoes, fresh basil and lime juice to a large bowl and mix very well.\n| Carefully spread the mixture over the hot [[baking tray]]\n| Bake for 25 to 35 minutes, adding the [[tomatoes]] about half way through and stirring well every 10 minutes.\n| The nicest results are when the rice ''just'' crisps and gets a nice chewy, toasted flavour. Be careful though - it spoils if it burns!\n| Sprinkle with [[Lime juice|lime juice]] and fresh [[basil]] leaves and serve immediately.\n}}\n\n{{Template:SeeAlso Roti}}\n{{Template:PeelingGinger}}\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Indian recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Spicy recipes]]\n[[Category:Chilli pepper recipes]]\n[[Category:Garlic recipes]]\n[[Category:Fish recipes]]\n[[Category:Rice recipes]]\n[[Category:Favourite recipes]]\n[[Category:Boiled or simmered]][[Category:Pan fried]][[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#rice #ghee #crayfishandcoconutricecakewithhotchillies #ginger #grated #turmericpowder #onions #coconut #basil #limejuice #tomatoes </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
