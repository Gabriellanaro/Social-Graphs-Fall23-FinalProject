I prefer to use [[garlic olive oil]].\n| &frac12; teaspoon [[salt]]\n| 2 cloves of garlic, peeled and crushed\n| 1 clove of garlic, peeled and chopped finely\n| 2 tablespoons of [[natural yogurt]]\n| 100 ml water\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Knead the [[dough]] by combining all the ingredients (apart from the '''chopped''' garlic) and sufficient water, this will be roughly &#190; cup.\n| Wrap the [[dough]] in a damp muslin cloth and leave it to rise for 2-3 hours.\n| Preheat an oven tray under your grill on it's very highest heat\n| Divide the [[dough]] into 4 small balls.\n| With a rolling pin or by slapping and stretching with your hands, roll out the balls so they are about the size of a pitta bread.\n| Unlike some breads, you don't need to let these prove, straight to the oven they go.\n| Sprinkle the chopped garlic onto both sides of the naans\n| [[Brush]] a little vegetable oil on to the hot tray, slap the naans on to the tray and grill for about 2 minutes a side, '''watching it like a hawk!'''  The difference between perfect naan breads and a brown biscuit is about 30 seconds.\n| They should have a crunch on the outside and a soft spongy inside.\n}}\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Bread maker Naan breads.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Roll out to the size of a pitta bread\nImage:Breadmaker Naan breads.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Divided into four\n</gallery>\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe hot, brushed with melted [[butter]].\n===Using a bread maker===\nIf you have a breadmaker, tip all of the ingredients into it apart from the '''chopped''' garlic, for the [[Panasonic SD-ZB2502 automatic breadmaker]] set it to menu option 16, basic dought, for the Panasonic SD253 breadmaker set it on a the basic dough setting (2:20) and start at step 3 above.  It could not be easier.\n===Variations===\nExperiment with various flours.  The seedy naans shown were made with Allinson ''seed and grain bread flour'' instead of plain flour, and they were wonderful. You could of course, just add a handful of mixed grain (barley flakes, kibbled rye, sunflower seeds, millet and linseed) to normal flour.\n===Chef's tip===\nUse a [[pizza stone]] if you have one for even better results.\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Garlic recipes]]\n[[Category:Indian recipes]]\n[[Category:Bread and baking]]\n[[Category:Breadmaker recipes]]\n[[Category:Accompaniments]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#garlicnaan #dough #butter #pizzastone #brush #naturalyogurt #garlicoliveoil #driedyeast #bakingpowder </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
