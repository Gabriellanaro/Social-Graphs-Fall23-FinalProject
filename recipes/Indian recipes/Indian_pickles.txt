The pickle serves as a flavour enhancer and is eaten typically in small pieces with the rest of the meal. There are a wide variety of different pickles. Each is usually made with a mixture of [[fruits]] or [[vegetables]], chopped and [[marinated]] in a liquid (often [[oil]] or [[lemon juice]]) and a variety of [[spices]] (often including lots of [[chili pepper]]) and [[salt]]. Pickling in India is an ancient art of [[food preservation]]. Indian pickles are quite different from the European variety in that the pickling is usually done in [[oil]] rather than using [[vinegar]].\n\nAll sorts of [[fruits]] and [[vegetables]] in south Asia are [[pickled]] in this manner, including [[pumpkins]], [[palm hearts]], [[lotus stems]], [[mango slices]], [[limes]] and rose petals, as well as [[vegetables]] more conventionally pickled in the West.\n===Indian pickle and chutney recipes on Cookipedia===\n* [[Bird's eye chilli paste]]\n* [[Chili vinegar recipe|Chili vinegar]]\n* [[Coconut chutney]]\n* [[Garlic pickle]]\n* [[Ginger chutney]]\n* [[Lemon pickle]]\n* [[Lemon pickle (with anise)]]\n* [[Lime pickle]]\n* [[Mango chutney]]\n* [[Mango and pear chutney (TM)]]\n* [[Mango relish]]\n* [[Mango pickle]]\n* [[Mixed pickle]]\n* [[Onion relish]]\n* [[Prawn Balchao]]\n* [[Spicy hot chutney]]\n* [[Tomato chutney]]\n==See also==\n* [[Chili pepper sauce|Our selection of chilli sauce recipes]]\n{{CategoryLineIngredients}}\n[[Category:Ingredients]]\n[[Category:Prepared foods]]\n[[Category:Store cupboard items]]\n[[Category:Vegetables]]\n[[Category:Pickles and preserves]]\n[[Category:Indian recipes]]\n[[Category:Pickled]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:12032020'>#indianpickles #vegetables #pickled #fruits #limepickle #palmhearts #onionrelish #marinated #lemonjuice #prawnbalchao #garlicpickle </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
