[[Refrigerate]] the moment it has cooled and use within 1 day\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 200 g (8 oz) uncooked [[basmati rice]].\n| 12 large raw [[king prawns]], deveined and each chopped into 3 pieces\n| 2 tablespoons [[Ghee|ghee]] or vegetable [[Oil|oil]]\n| 5 [[Fat|fat]] [[Garlic cloves, peeled and crushed|garlic cloves, peeled and crushed]]\n| 5 cm (2\") [[Ginger|ginger]], peeled and roughly [[Grated|grated]] - try making some [[Frozen ginger paste]], it is a good as fresh and lasts for years.\n| 75 g (5 oz) [[Onions|onions]], peeled and finely chopped\n| 1 whole [[Coconut|coconut]], flesh removed and roughly grated - see [[Action coconut scraper with vacuum suction base]] for the easy way to do this.\n| 4 hot [[Chilli peppers|chilli peppers]] (red or green), finely chopped - de-seeded if desired\n| 2 large tomatoes chopped into small pieces\n| 1 tablespoon [[Lime juice|lime juice]]\n}}\n'''spices'''\n\n''don't grind the spices, leave them whole''\n* 2 teaspoons whole [[coriander seeds]]\n* 1 teaspoon whole [[cumin seeds]] (white)\n* 1/2 a teaspoon of whole [[fenugreek seeds]]\n* 1 teaspoon [[turmeric powder]]\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:King prawn and coconut roti with tomatoes, chillies and ginger breakfast.jpg|Ready to serve with some left over for my breakfast!\nImage:King prawn and coconut roti with tomatoes, chillies and ginger browned.jpg|Browned under the grill\nImage:King prawn and coconut roti with tomatoes, chillies and ginger prawns.jpg|Prawns added, ready to grill\nImage:King prawn and coconut roti with tomatoes.jpg|Tomatoes mixed in; the rice cake is ready to [[pan-fry]]\n</gallery>\n\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Quickly wash and drain the [[rice]] but don't rinse it as you normally would, this dish is best with rice of a starchy consistency. \n| Cook in boiling water for 7 to 11 minutes.\n| Rinse the cooked rice in cold water until it is cold.  Drain well.\n| Add the [[Rice|rice]] and [[Coconut|coconut]] to a [[Food processor|food processor]] with a metal blade and blend to a thick creamy consistency - adding a little milk if required to make it thinner.  Remember, the inside is not going to change much whilst being cooked and will remain at roughly the same consistency as it was when first mixed. \n| Heat the [[Ghee|ghee]] in a [[frying pan]] or [[Wok|wok]] and [[Stir-fry|stir-fry]] all of the [[Spices|spices]] for half a minute, then add the [[Ginger|ginger]] and [[Garlic|garlic]] and allow them to cook for a minute or so.\n| Add the [[Onion|onion]] and reduce the heat a little and let them cook until translucent; about 5 minutes.\n| Add the [[Chilli|chilli]] to the [[Onions|onions]], mix well and immediately remove from the heat.\n| Preheat the [[Grill|grill]].\n| Lightly [[Oil|oil]] a large non-stick oven proof [[Frying pan|frying pan]] put on a medium heat.\n| Add the rice mixture to the hot pan and ensure the mixture is evenly distributed and patted down.  Distribute the chopped tomatoes evenly throughout the rice and coconut mixture.\n| Cook for about 10 minutes or until the [[Rice|rice]] cake starts to catch on the bottom, then mix it up well so you get lots of crispy bits.\n| Mix in the raw [[king prawns]] and pat down.\n| [[Brown|brown]] under the hot [[Grill|grill]] for about 5 minutes just to colour the top surface a little.\n| Sprinkle with [[Lime juice|lime juice]] and serve immediately.\n}}\n\n===Serving suggestions===\nThis is a perfect meal on its own though it can benefit from a few tablespoons of [[yogurt]] as a side dish if the [[chillies]] are really hot.  [[Peas]] and [[sweetcorn]] make a nice colourful accompaniment to this spicy recipe too.\n===A better way of cooking this===\nAfter making variants of this for many years, I've discovered the best method of cooking is to spread the ingredients out on a lightly greased [[baking tray]] and bake at 220\u00b0 C (425\u00b0 F - gas 7) for 35 minutes, stirring up the contents every 10 minutes.  It might be an idea with a meat other than crayfish, to add the meat (or prawns) for the last 10 minutes so they don't dry out.\n[[Image:Crayfish & coconut chili, 1.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Baking tray method shown here with [[Crayfish and coconut rice cake with hot chillies]]]]\n\n===Variations===\nAdd a splash of [[nam pla]] to the chopped prawns and let them [[marinade]] for a few hours for a more fishy taste.\n{{Template:SeeAlso Roti}}\n{{Template:PeelingGinger}}\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Indian recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Spicy recipes]]\n[[Category:Chilli pepper recipes]]\n[[Category:Garlic recipes]]\n[[Category:Fish recipes]]\n[[Category:Rice recipes]]\n[[Category:Favourite recipes]]\n[[Category:Boiled or simmered]][[Category:Pan fried]][[Category:Grilled, griddled or barbecued]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#kingprawnandcoconutrotiwithtomatoeschilliesandginger #rice #kingprawns #ginger #onions #coconut #grill #ghee #limejuice #tomatoes #chillies </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
