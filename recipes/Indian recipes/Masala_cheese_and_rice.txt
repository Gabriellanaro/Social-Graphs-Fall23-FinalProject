In his restaurant, he serves it as a canap\u00e9, but I have adapted it to be more substantial and have treated it in two ways.  The first way is to shape it into balls, which are then [[Deep fried|deep fried]] and the second is to [[Bake|bake]] it in a [[Baking|baking]] tin or [[Casserole dish|casserole dish]].  You can do as I did and make half-in-half.\n[[Image:Masala cheese and rice recipe2.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Masala cheese and rice (baked)]]\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 1 quantity of [[Red onion khichdi|red onion khichdi]]\n| [[Plain flour]] (only if it is to be [[Fried|fried]])\n| [[Breadcrumbs]], mixed with [[Nigella|nigella]] or black [[Sesame seeds|sesame seeds]] (only if it is to be [[Fried|fried]])\n| [[Vegetable oil]] (only if it is to be [[Fried|fried]])\n}}\n'''For the filling / topping'''\n* 120g strong [[Cheddar cheese]]\n* 120g [[Mozzarella cheese|mozzarella cheese]]\n* 3 tablespoons [[Red onion|red onion]], finely chopped\n* 3 [[Green chillies|green chillies]], finely chopped\n* 1 tablespoon [[Fresh ginger|fresh ginger]], peeled and finely chopped\n* 6 tablespoon fresh [[Coriander|coriander]], chopped\n* 2 teaspoons of [[Chaat masala|chaat masala]]\n* [[Salt]]\n\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Put the [[Khichdi|khichdi]] in a bowl and [[Mash|mash]] it up a bit using a fork.\n| In another bowl, mix the filling / topping ingredients until they stick together.\n| If you are [[Baking|baking]] it, simply use the [[Khichdi|khichdi]] as a base in a baking tin or [[Casserole dish|casserole dish]] and spread the topping mixture over it.\n| It can then be [[Baked|baked]] for around 20 minutes at 190\u00b0 C (375\u00b0 F - gas 5), or until the [[Cheese|cheese]] has melted.\n| To make the balls, divide both the [[Khichdi|khichdi]] and the filling into 8.\n| Take half of each [[Khichdi|khichdi]] portion into the palm of your [[Hand|hand]] and place a whole filling portion in the centre.\n| Take the remaining half of the [[Khichdi|khichdi]] and place it over the filling.\n| Shape into balls, ensuring that the filling is contained within the [[Khichdi|khichdi]].\n| Place in the [[Fridge|fridge]] on a [[baking tray]] and leave for about 30 minutes until thay have firmed up.\n| Put some [[Flour|flour]] in a bowl and add sufficient water to make a thin [[Batter|batter]].\n| In another bowl, place the [[Breadcrumb|breadcrumb]] mixture.\n| Heat the [[Vegetable oil|vegetable oil]] in a fryer or deep saucepan to 180\u00b0 C.\n| Whilst this is heating, coat each ball in the [[Batter|batter]] and then roll it in the [[Breadcrumbs|breadcrumbs]] and [[Seeds|seeds]] until well covered.\n| [[Fry]] until golden [[Brown|brown]] and drain on kitchen paper.\n| Serve immediately.\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe with [[Chilli and garlic dip|chilli and garlic dip]]\n{{Template:PeelingGinger}}\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Chilli pepper recipes]]\n[[Category:Garlic recipes]]\n[[Category:Indian recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Rice recipes]]\n[[Category:Snacks and light bites]]\n[[Category:Spicy recipes]]\n[[Category:Starters]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes]]\n[[Category:Deep fried]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#khichdi #masalacheeseandrice #fried #vegetableoil #breadcrumbs #baking #batter #casseroledish #bake #seeds #bakingtray </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
