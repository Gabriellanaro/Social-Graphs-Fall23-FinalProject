Please be very careful if storing cooked [[Rice|rice]].  [[Refrigerate]] the moment it has cooled and use within 1 day.\n\nTry this using two pans, see Chef's notes below.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 225 g (8 oz) uncooked [[basmati rice]].\n| 175 g (6 oz) cooked [[Chicken|chicken]] pieces - remove any [[bones]]\n| 2 tablespoons [[Ghee|ghee]] or vegetable [[Oil|oil]]\n| 5 [[Fat|fat]] [[Garlic cloves, peeled and crushed|garlic cloves, peeled and crushed]]\n| 5 cm (2\") [[Ginger|ginger]], peeled and roughly [[Grated|grated]]\n| 150 g (5 oz) [[Onions|onions]], peeled and finely chopped\n| 1 fresh [[Coconut|coconut]], flesh grated and removed, see [[Preparing a coconut]]\n| 4 hot [[Chilli peppers|chilli peppers]] (red or green), finely chopped - de-seeded if desired\n| 1 tablespoon [[Lime juice|lime juice]]\n}}\n'''spices'''\n\n''The charm of this dish is the 'bite' of the whole spices, don't be tempted to grind them!''\n* 2 teaspoons whole [[coriander seeds]]\n* 1 teaspoon whole [[cumin seeds]] (white)\n* 1/2 a teaspoon of whole [[fenugreek seeds]]\n* 1 teaspoon [[turmeric powder]]\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Quickly wash and drain the [[rice]] but don't rinse it as you normally would, this dish is best with rice of a starchy consistency. \n| Cook in boiling water for 7 to 11 minutes.\n| Rinse the cooked rice in cold water until it is cold.  Drain well.\n| Add the [[Rice|rice]] to a [[Food processor|food processor]] with a metal blade and blend to a thick creamy pur\u00e9e - adding a little milk if it needs thinning.  Remember, the inside is not going to change much whilst being cooked and will remain at roughly the same consistency as it was when first mixed. \n| Heat the [[Ghee|ghee]] in a [[Wok|wok]] or [[frying pan]] and [[Stir-fry|stir-fry]] all of the [[Spices|spices]] for half a minute, then add the [[Ginger|ginger]] and [[Garlic|garlic]] and allow them to cook for a minute or so.\n| Add the [[Onion|onion]] and reduce the heat a little and let them cook until translucent; about 5 minutes.\n| Add the [[Chicken|chicken]], [[Coconut|coconut]] and [[Chilli|chilli]] to the [[Onions|onions]], mix well and remove from the heat.\n| In a large bowl, mix everything together with the rice puree.\n| Lightly [[Oil|oil]] a large non-stick oven proof [[Frying pan|frying pan]] put on a medium heat.\n| Preheat the [[Grill|grill]].\n| Add the mixture from the bowl to the frying pan and pat down so it is flat\n| Ensure the mixture is evenly distributed and cook gently for about 10 minutes or until the [[Rice|rice]] [[Cake|cake]] has properly solidified.\n| If it catches on the bottom of the pan, use a pallet knife to turn areas of the mixture over, the more crunchy bits there are, the nicer it will taste. \n| After 10 minutes or so, finish the rice cake off under a hot grill to it's nicely toasted.\n| Sprinkle with [[Lime juice|lime juice]] and serve immediately.\n}}\n\n[[Image:Action coconut scraper with vacuum suction base.jpg|300px|thumb|right|An easier way to prepare the grated coconut - [http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00B7JDDL6?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o07_s00 Action coconut scraper with vacuum suction base - \u00a38.98 Amazon UK]]]\n\nInstead of fresh [[green chillies]], I have used 3/4 teaspoon of diced [[ancho]] & 3/4 teaspoon diced [[chipotle]] (dried) [[chillies]].\n\nDoing a 'freezer clean out', we made a marvellous version of this with 1 [[chicken]] breast and a bag of cooked red kidney beans.  The chicken was thinly sliced and saut\u00e9ed with lots of crushed [[garlic]] and the kidney beans fried with the chicken and mashed down a little - rather like [[re-fried beans]].  This was added in place of the normally cooked chicken in this recipe.\n\nThis recipe is great for using up the leftover Christmas [[turkey]].\n===Chef's notes===\nHaving made this many, many times now, I'm coming to the conclusion that the best part is the glorious toasted crunchy outsides.  In future I will use two pans and made two thinner individual rotis.\n\nI heeded [[Preparing a coconut|my own advice]] and tasted the coconut before preparing it.  It was totally rancid, thank you Morrisons.  Luckily I had both [[coconut flakes]] and [[desiccated coconut]]. For two people, I used two big handfuls of flakes and 4 tablespoons of [[desiccated coconut]] soaked in boiling water for 5 minutes then drained in a sieve.  It worked fine and saved the day!\n\n===A better way of cooking this===\nAfter making variants of this for many years, I've discovered the best method of cooking is to spread the ingredients out on a lightly greased [[baking tray]] and bake at 220\u00b0 C (425\u00b0 F - gas 7) for 35 minutes, stirring up the contents every 10 minutes.  It might be an idea with a meat other than crayfish, to add the meat (or prawns) for the last 10 minutes so they don't dry out.\n===Variations===\nSteamed chicken works well in this recipe - Follow the [[Chinese style steamed chicken]] using a quartered onion and a handful of fresh herbs instead of the Chinese ingredients \n\n[[Image:Crayfish & coconut chili, 1.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Baking tray method shown here with [[Crayfish and coconut rice cake with hot chillies]]]]\n\n{{Template:SeeAlso Roti}}\n{{Template:PeelingGinger}}\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Indian recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Spicy recipes]]\n[[Category:Chilli pepper recipes]]\n[[Category:Garlic recipes]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:Poultry recipes]]\n[[Category:Rice recipes]]\n[[Category:Favourite recipes]]\n[[Category:Boiled or simmered]][[Category:Pan fried]][[Category:Grilled, griddled or barbecued]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#murghiroti #rice #chicken #preparingacoconut #limejuice #desiccatedcoconut #garlic #ghee #onions #coconut #spices </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
