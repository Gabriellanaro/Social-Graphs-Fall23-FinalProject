Depending on the local cuisine it may also contain a variety of meat and vegetables. Pilaf and similar dishes are common to Middle Eastern, Central, South Asian, Latin American and Caribbean cuisine.\n\nThis version of pulao rice is a bit of a fiddle but worth making it if you have the time.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 2 Cups [[Basmati rice]] (well rinsed under cold water)\n| 1 Knorr chicken cube\n| 2 oz [[Clarification|ghee]] or oil\n| 6 whole [[cloves]]\n| 6 black or green [[cardamom pods]] (slightly crushed under a flat knife)\n| 1 5cm (2\") rolled [[Cinnamon|cinnamon]] stick\n| 4 cups boiling water\n| &#189; teaspoon [[turmeric]] powder\n| pinch of [[saffron]] strands\n| 1 oz flaked [[almonds]]\n| 1 oz seedless [[sultanas]]\n| 2 medium [[onions]], chopped (1 for garnish, 1 for the rice)\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| In a large heavy pan melt the [[Clarification|ghee]] and fry both of the chopped [[onions]] until browned\n| remove half of the [[onions]] and reserve, leaving most of the oil in the pan\n| Add dry spices and fry for 2 minutes\n| Add the rice and coat with the oil and spices\n| Sprinkle the crumbled stock cube over the rice mixture\n| Add water and bring to the boil, cover and simmer for 10-12 minutes.
