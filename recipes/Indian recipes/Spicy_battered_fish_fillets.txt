ISBN 0-7499-1185-9.  It was incredibly tasty but on reflection, cutting the [[basa]] into small chunks, [[frying]] separately and then placing on skewers seemed rather involved and pointless.\n\nThis time I used the spicy batter to coat the whole fillets and then shallow fried them.  The result was fantastic, the batter sticking really well to the fish.  Do try this, it is a rather special recipe!\n\n[[Basa]] is an excellent firm and flavoursome [[Fish|fish]] that is also sustainable.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 1 packs [[Basa|basa]] fillets (about 320 g) [\u00a32.00 Morrisons - May 2011]\n| 2 tablespoons freshly squeezed [[Lemon juice|lemon juice]]\n| 1 tablespoon freshly Crushed [[Garlic|garlic]]\n| 1 tablespoon freshly [[Grated|grated]] [[Root ginger|root ginger]]\n| 1 [[egg]] - beaten\n| 2 tablespoons [[Single cream|single cream]], [[sour cream]], [[yogurt]] or even [[milk]]\n| 1.5 tablespoons of [[Gram flour|gram flour]]\n| 1 teaspoon of whole [[Lovage seeds|lovage seeds]]\n| &#189; teaspoon of whole [[fennel seeds]]\n| &#189; teaspoon [[turmeric]]\n| &#189; teaspoon fine [[Sea Salt|sea salt]]\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Add the [[Basa|basa]], [[Garlic|garlic]], [[Ginger|ginger]] and [[Lemon juice|lemon juice]] to a [[Lock and Lock box|lock and lock box]], close, shake well and [[Refrigerate|refrigerate]] for 30 minutes or so to [[Marinade|marinade]].\n| Whisk the egg in another bowl and add the remaining ingredients, whisk to the consistency of thickish [[double cream]]. Adjust by adding more flour or cream.\n| Pour the egg mixture into the [[Lock and Lock box]], close and shake like mad.\n| [[Refrigerate]] for a further 15 minutes or until you are ready to use it.\n| Shallow [[Fry|fry]] in [[Ghee|ghee]], [[Butter|butter]] or [[olive oil]] until the batter is golden and the fish is cooked.  Try not to disturb it too much or the batter will come away from the fish.\n}}\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Indian recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Spicy recipes]]\n[[Category:Fish recipes]]\n[[Category:Freshwater fish recipes]]\n[[Category:Garlic recipes]]\n[[Category:Sea fish recipes]]\n[[Category:Favourite recipes]]\n[[Category:Pan fried]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#basa #spicybatteredfishfillets #refrigerate #garlic #lemonjuice #marinade #frying #singlecream #egg #rootginger #grated </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
