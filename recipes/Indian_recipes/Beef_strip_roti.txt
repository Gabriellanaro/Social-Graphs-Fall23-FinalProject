This another of my variations on this dish but using cooked strips of [[beef]].  It is not the least bit authentic as the cow is sacred and forbidden as food in the Hindu religion of India.  I had about 250 g of ready cooked [[Sous vide beef prime topside joint]] so I thought I should try using it in this recipe.  It was delicious as always ([[Murghi roti]] is one of my all time favourite recipes), but I have to say I prefer the chicken version over beef.\n\nA great recipe for using up leftovers.  Please be very careful if storing cooked [[Rice|rice]].  [[Refrigerate]] the moment it has cooled and use within 1 day.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 225 g (8 oz) uncooked [[basmati rice]].\n| 250g g (6 oz) cooked [[Sous vide beef prime topside joint]] cut into strips - any left over [[beef]] would be good also\n| 2 tablespoons [[Ghee|ghee]] or vegetable [[Oil|oil]]\n| 5 [[Fat|fat]] [[Garlic cloves, peeled and crushed|garlic cloves, peeled and crushed]]\n| 5 cm (2\") [[Ginger|ginger]], peeled and roughly [[Grated|grated]]\n| 150 g (5 oz) [[Onions|onions]], peeled and finely chopped\n| 1 fresh [[coconut]] ,flesh removed and grated\n|* see [[Preparing a coconut]]\n| 4 hot [[Chilli peppers|chilli peppers]] (red or green), finely chopped - de-seeded if desired\n| 1 tablespoon [[Lime juice|lime juice]]\n| A bunch of [[coriander]], chopped\n}}\n'''spices'''\n\n''The charm of this dish is the 'bite' of the whole spices, don't be tempted to grind them!''\n* 2 teaspoons whole [[coriander seeds]]\n* 1 teaspoon of whole [[cumin seeds]] (white)\n* 1/2 a teaspoon of whole [[fenugreek seeds]]\n* 1 teaspoon [[turmeric powder]]\n\n\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Quickly wash and drain the [[rice]] but don't rinse it as you normally would, this dish is best with rice of a starchy consistency. \n| Cook in boiling water for 7 to 11 minutes.\n| Rinse the cooked rice in cold water until it is cold.  Drain well.\n| Add the [[Rice|rice]] to a [[Food processor|food processor]] with a metal blade and blend to a thick creamy pur\u00e9e - adding a little milk if it needs thinning.  Remember, the inside is not going to change much whilst being cooked and will remain at roughly the same consistency as it was when first mixed. \n| Heat the [[Ghee|ghee]] in a [[Wok|wok]] or [[frying pan]] and [[Stir-fry|stir-fry]] all of the [[Spices|spices]] for half a minute, then add the [[Ginger|ginger]] and [[Garlic|garlic]] and allow them to cook for a minute or so.\n| Add the [[Onion|onion]] and reduce the heat a little and let them cook until translucent; about 5 minutes.\n| Add the [[beef]], [[Coconut|coconut]] and [[Chilli|chilli]] to the [[Onions|onions]], mix well and remove from the heat.\n| In a large bowl add the rice and the onion mixture together with the chopped [[coriander]] and mix really well\n| Lightly [[Oil|oil]] a large heavy non-stick oven proof [[Frying pan|frying pan]] put on a gentle heat.\n| Ensure the mixture is evenly distributed and cook gently for about 5 minutes or until the [[Rice|rice]] [[Cake|cake]] has properly solidified.\n| You can leave it as it is or mix it up as its cooking, pressing it flat again before you finally grill it.\n| Preheat the [[Grill|grill]].\n| Pop the pan under the grill and grill for 10 minutes or until it is nicely browned.\n| Sprinkle with [[Lime juice|lime juice]] and serve immediately.\n}}\n\nInstead of fresh [[green chillies]], I have used 3/4 teaspoon of diced [[ancho]] & 3/4 teaspoon diced [[chipotle]] (dried) [[chillies]].\n\nI heeded [[Preparing a coconut|my own advice]] and tasted the coconut before preparing it.  It was totally rancid, thank you Morrisons.  Luckily I had both [[coconut flakes]] and [[desiccated coconut]]. For two people, I used two big handfuls of flakes and 4 tablespoons of [[desiccated coconut]] soaked in boiling water for 5 minutes then drained in a sieve.  It worked fine and saved the day!\n\n[[Image:Action coconut scraper with vacuum suction base.jpg|300px|thumb|right|An easier way to prepare the grated coconut - [http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00B7JDDL6?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o07_s00 Action coconut scraper with vacuum suction base - \u00a38.98 Amazon UK]]]\n\n===A better way of cooking this===\nAfter making variants of this for many years, I've discovered the best method of cooking is to spread the ingredients out on a lightly greased [[baking tray]] and bake at 220\u00b0 C (425\u00b0 F - gas 7) for 35 minutes, stirring up the contents every 10 minutes.  It might be an idea with a meat other than crayfish, to add the meat (or prawns) for the last 10 minutes so they don't dry out.\n[[Image:Crayfish & coconut chili, 1.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Baking tray method shown here with [[Crayfish and coconut rice cake with hot chillies]]]]\n\n{{Template:PeelingGinger}}\n{{Template:SeeAlso Roti}}\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Indian recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Spicy recipes]]\n[[Category:Chilli pepper recipes]]\n[[Category:Garlic recipes]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:Poultry recipes]]\n[[Category:Rice recipes]]\n[[Category:Favourite recipes]]\n[[Category:Boiled or simmered]][[Category:Pan fried]][[Category:Grilled, griddled or barbecued]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#rice #beef #limejuice #preparingacoconut #desiccatedcoconut #coriander #ghee #coconut #onions #murghiroti #spices </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
