It's quite unusual and very nice.  The cooking method makes for a more creamy textured rice and the cumin flavour is pleasant but not overpowering.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 1 cup of [[Basmati rice|basmati rice]]\n| 2 tablespoons of [[Vegetable oil|vegetable oil]] or [[Ghee|ghee]]\n| 1 large [[Onion|onion]], peeled and finely chopped\n| 2 teaspoons of white [[Cumin seeds|cumin seeds]]\n| Boiling water or [[vegetable stock]]\n| Chopped [[Coriander leaves|coriander leaves]] to garnish\n\n}}\n\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n* Rinse the [[Rice|rice]] in a [[Sieve|sieve]] under cold running water, stirring with your hands until the water runs clear. Drain well\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Cook the [[Rice|rice]] in lots of [[Boiling|boiling]] water until the rice is soft on the outside but still has a tiny bite to it.  About 5 minutes\n| Remove from the heat and drain in a [[Sieve|sieve]]\n| Meanwhile, add the [[Ghee|ghee]] and [[Onions|onions]] to a large pan and saut\u00e9 until they just turn [[Brown|brown]].\n| Stir in the [[Cumin seeds|cumin seeds]].\n| Once they start to pop, stir in the [[Rice|rice]].\n| Add half a cup of [[Boiling|boiling]] water or [[vegetable stock]], cover with a lid, placing a cloth between the pan and the lid being careful not to catch it alight!\n| [[Simmer]] gently for a further 5 minutes then remove from the heat and let it stand for 7 to 10  minutes so all of the water is absorbed.  Don't stir or mix it at all during this process.\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe garnished with chopped [[Coriander leaves|coriander leaves]]\n===Variations===\nAdd a small pinch of [[black cumin]] seeds as well as the [[white cumin]] seeds.\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Indian recipes]]\n[[Category:Mauritian recipes]]\n[[Category:Accompaniments]]\n[[Category:Rice recipes]]\n[[Category:Favourite recipes]]\n[[Category:Boiled or simmered]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#cuminrice #rice #cuminseeds #ghee #vegetablestock #boiling #sieve #corianderleaves #blackcumin #vegetableoil #miseenplace </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
