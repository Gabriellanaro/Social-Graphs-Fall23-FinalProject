It is our 'go to' recipe for curries.  Give it a try!\n\nThe recipe below makes about 1500 grams of curry sauce which we split into three 500 gram portions and vacuum seal and freeze for later use. A 500g portion is ideal for two people once meat or fish is added.\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| 1 tablespoon of [[ghee]]\n| 2  tablespoons [[Olive oil|olive oil]]\n| big pinch of [[Ground black pepper|ground black pepper]]\n| 2 medium [[Onions|onions]], peeled and sliced\n| 5 [[Cloves of garlic|cloves of garlic]], peeled and thinly sliced\n| 1 can of [[Coconut milk|coconut milk]]\n| 2 cans of chopped [[Tomatoes|tomatoes]]\n| 1 teaspoon of [[malt vinegar]] - '''no more!'''\n| 1 can of drained mixed beans or [[Kidney beans|kidney beans]]\n| 2 heaped teaspoons of Hot Madras [[Curry powder|curry powder]]\n| 1 heaped teaspoon of [[Hot chilli powder|hot chilli powder]]\n| 1 heaped teaspoon of [[Turmeric powder|turmeric powder]]\n| 1 heaped teaspoon of [[paprika powder]]\n| 1 teaspoon of whole [[Fenugreek seeds|fenugreek seeds]]\n| 1 tablespoon of [[Muscovado sugar|muscovado sugar]]\n| 3 teaspoons of [[Dried|dried]] [[Parsley|parsley]]\n| 1 teaspoon of [[Vegetable Stock|vegetable stock]] powder\n| 2 pinches of [[garam masala]]\n| &#189; teaspoon of [[Sea Salt|sea salt]]\n}}\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Indian_Curry_Sauce_3_Vac-sealed_bags.jpg|This recipe makes just about 3 x 500g [2 person] bags, ideal for freezing\nImage:Indian_Curry_Sauce_After_Cooking.jpg|Curry sauce after slow-cooking for 5 hours\nImage:Indian_Curry_Sauce_Before_Cooking.jpg|Curry sauce, ready to cook\n</gallery>\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| Mix all of the [[Dried|dried]] ingredients together so they can be added in one go\n| In a [[Wok|wok]], [[Fry|fry]] the [[Onions|onions]] for 5 minutes over a medium heat\n| Add the sliced [[Garlic|garlic]] and [[Stir fry|stir fry]] for a minute or so\n| Stir in all of the [[Dried|dried]] ingredients and mix well\n| Immediately add the vinegar, tinned [[Tomatoes|tomatoes]], [[Coconut milk|coconut milk]] and [[Kidney beans|kidney beans]]\n| Mix well and add to the [[Slow Cooker|slow cooker]] on a low setting\n| Slow cook for 5 hours\n| Blend to a fine sauce using a [[stick blender]].\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\n500g [[lamb neck fillet]] cut into cubes and slow cooked; low setting, for 5+ hours, makes the best lamb curry.\n\nWe served this with [[Roasted|roasted]] [[Butternut squash|butternut squash]], [[Baked|baked]] for 90 minutes at 200\u00b0 C\n===Variations===\nThis works as a [[Vegetarian|vegetarian]] [[Curry|curry]] [[Sauce|sauce]] but would work equally well with [[Meat|meat]] or [[Fish|fish]].\n\nI would be inclined to add any [[Meat|meat]] at the start of the slow-cooking process, but I would add [[Fish|fish]] or [[Prawns|prawns]] just for the final hour, to prevent over cooking.\n\n===Quantities for freezing===\nWe [[vacuum seal]] the curry sauce in packets of around 500g which are good for two people once meat or vegetables are added.  If you were making double quantities of this recipe you can make six 420g bags of curry sauce for the freezer.\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Indian recipes]]\n[[Category:Spicy recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegan recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes]]\n[[Category:Chilli pepper recipes]]\n[[Category:Garlic recipes]]\n[[Category:Slow cooker recipes]]\n[[Category:Stewed, braised or pot roasted]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#currysauce #dried #tomatoes #onions #coconutmilk #fish #kidneybeans #fry #paprikapowder #garammasala #slowcooker </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
