I also increased the spice by adding 1 teaspoon jalfrezi masala plus 1 teaspoon of [[Pakistani basar]].\n\nMy husband said that this would be excellent with noodles and small pieces of chicken as a type of homemade Pot Noodle.\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Indian recipes]]\n[[Category:Spanish recipes]]\n[[Category:Dips and sauces]]\n[[Category:Spicy recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes]]\n[[Category:Egg recipes]]\n[[Category:Thermomix recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#thermomix #sauce #currypowder #spanish #lentils #eggs #pakistanibasar #chicken #yolks #stew #thermomixrecipes </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
