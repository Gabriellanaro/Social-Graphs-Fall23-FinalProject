But I figure that badly done instructions are way better than no instructions at all, so until I get the chance to make and photograph some real [[samosas]], this will have to suffice.\n<gallery widths=250px perrow=5>\nImage:Folding samosas2.jpg|Fold bottom left to the top middle, press the air out of the filling\nImage:Folding samosas3.jpg|Fold top right to top left, again press the air out of the filling\nImage:Folding samosas4.jpg|Seal the last fold with flour and water paste\nImage:Folding samosas5.jpg|Fold the final edge far left to right and squeeze to seal<br />Perfect paper samosas!\n</gallery>\n\nUse [[filo]] pastry and keep it moist by covering all the sheets with a damp tea-towel. Take each sheet out one at a time to make a samosa.\n\nMix a little [[plain flour]] with a few drops of water into a paste which you can use to seal the final fold.\n\nIf you are making these for the first time, find somewhere comfortable where you can sit down while you make them. Put some music on, relax and practice with sheets of paper first!  If, when you are doing it for real, the pastry tears, discard the pastry (or fry on its own and scoff by yourself later) and then start again, otherwise all the contents will just spill out when you deep fry the [[samosas]].\n\n[[Deep fry]] in small batches (this prevents the temperature of the oil from falling too much/too quickly) for about 3 or 4 minutes or until they are golden brown. Lift then out with a [[slotted spoon]] and drain on kitchen paper. Serve immediately or keep warm in the oven until they are all [[fried]].\n==See also==\n\n* A [[meat samosa recipe]]\n* A [[vegetable samosa recipe]]\n\n{{CategoryLineIngredients}}\n[[Category:Cooking methods]]\n[[Category:Indian recipes|Folding Samosas]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:12032020'>#foldingsamosas #samosas #deepfry #fried #plainflour #unusualrecipes #slottedspoon #filo #meatsamosarecipe #cookingmethods #vegetablesamosarecipe </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
