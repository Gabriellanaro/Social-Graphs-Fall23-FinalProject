I made with one whole star anise (not one 'petal'), but I think it would be better with 2.  I used 6 dried [[birds' eye chillies]] and 2 large dried [[chile de Arbole]].  I had run out of limes so I used bottled lemon juice and a handful of crushed lemon leaves from our ornamental tree in the [[marinade]] and the cooking.\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Oriental cuisine]]\n[[Category:Vietnamese recipes]]\n[[Category:Chilli pepper recipes]]\n[[Category:Fish recipes]]\n[[Category:Indian recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Shellfish recipes]]\n[[Category:Spicy recipes]]\n[[Category:Favourite recipes]]\n[[Category:Stir fried]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#cauliflower #coffeegrinder #prawns #ground #garlic #noodles #nampla #bread #chillies #zest #simmer </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
