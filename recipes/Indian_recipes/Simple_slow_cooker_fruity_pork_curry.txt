If your slow [[Cooker|cooker]] cannot fry then either start the [[Frying|frying]] in a [[Frying pan|frying pan]], of just  ignore the frying, it won't make a massive difference.\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| A pinch of [[Freshly ground black pepper|freshly ground black pepper]]\n| 1 large [[Leek|leek]], cleaned, cut in half lengthwise and then chopped into 'rings'.\n| 1 [[Pork fillet|pork fillet]]\n| 4 [[Cloves of garlic|cloves of garlic]], peeled and chopped\n| 1 tablespoon [[Ghee|ghee]]\n| 1 tablespoon [[Olive oil|olive oil]]\n| \u00bd teaspoon [[Mixed herbs|mixed herbs]]\n| 300ml [[Orange]] and [[Mango]] [[Juice|juice]]\n| 1 heaped tablespoon of [[Curry powder|curry powder]]\n| 3 tablespoons of [[Sultanas|sultanas]]\n| 6 soft [[Apricots|apricots]], cut into quarters\n| 1 stick of [[Rhubarb|rhubarb]], chopped - I've used some that was [[Frozen|frozen]] from the summer\n}}\n\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| Add the [[Black pepper|black pepper]], [[Oil|oil]] and [[Ghee|ghee]] to your [[Slow Cooker|slow cooker]], set to [[Hob|hob]]-mode (or [[Frying pan|frying pan]])\n| [[Fry]] the [[Pork fillet|pork fillet]] for 5 minutes, turning now and then\n| Add the [[Leeks|leeks]] and [[Fry|fry]] for another 5 minutes, adding the chopped [[Garlic|garlic]] for the last minute or so\n| Set the [[Slow Cooker|slow cooker]] to high slow-cook\n| Add the remaining ingredients, mix very well and and cook for 2 hours, stirring now and then if you are able\n| Slice the [[Pork fillet|pork fillet]] and serve with [[Side dishes|side dishes]] of your chosing\n}}\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Simple slow cooker fruity pork curry.jpg|Simple slow cooker fruity pork curry; the basic ingredients\nImage:Simple slow cooker fruity pork curry after one hour.jpg|Pork curry after one hour in the slow cooker\nImage:Slow cooked pork fillet carved for curry.jpg|Slow cooked pork fillet carved and ready for the curry sauce\n</gallery>\n===Serving suggestions===\nWe've chosen a [[Vegetable|vegetable]] [[Rice|rice]] and [[Naan breads|naan breads]], sprinkled with [[Coconut Merchant Toasted Coconut Chips]].\n===Chef's notes===\nIf you don't have [[Ghee|ghee]], just double the amount of [[Oil|oil]].

Only use 1 tbs of curry powder and very little chilli powder in future. \ud83d\ude13\n===Chef's noters===\nI've mixed my [[Curry|curry]] powder [[Blend|blend]] and [[Taste Sensation Kashmiri Curry Powder]], together with \u00bd teaspoon of [[Turmeric|turmeric]] and a pinch of [[Fenugreek|fenugreek]]; I like to fiddle with my [[Spices|spices]]!\n\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Indian recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Spicy recipes]]\n[[Category:Garlic recipes]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:Pork recipes]]\n[[Category:Slow cooker recipes]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n[[Category:Taste Sensation recipes]]\n[[Category:Slow cooked]]\n[[Category:Recipes from other sites]]\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:12032020'>#slowcooker #simpleslowcookerfruityporkcurry #porkfillet #ghee #fry #curry #leeks #rice #juice #leek #naanbreads</code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
