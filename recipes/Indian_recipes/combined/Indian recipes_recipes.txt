I had about 250 g of ready cooked [[Sous vide beef prime topside joint]] so I thought I should try using it in this recipe.  It was delicious as always ([[Murghi roti]] is one of my all time favourite recipes), but I have to say I prefer the chicken version over beef.\n\nA great recipe for using up leftovers.

Drain well.\n| Add the [[Rice|rice]] to a [[Food processor|food processor]] with a metal blade and blend to a thick creamy pur\u00e9e - adding a little milk if it needs thinning.  Remember, the inside is not going to change much whilst being cooked and will remain at roughly the same consistency as it was when first mixed. \n| Heat the [[Ghee|ghee]] in a [[Wok|wok]] or [[frying pan]] and [[Stir-fry|stir-fry]] all of the [[Spices|spices]] for half a minute, then add the [[Ginger|ginger]] and [[Garlic|garlic]] and allow them to cook for a minute or so.\n| Add the [[Onion|onion]] and reduce the heat a little and let them cook until translucent; about 5 minutes.\n| Add the [[beef]], [[Coconut|coconut]] and [[Chilli|chilli]] to the [[Onions|onions]], mix well and remove from the heat.\n| In a large bowl add the rice and the onion mixture together with the chopped [[coriander]] and mix really well\n| Lightly [[Oil|oil]] a large heavy non-stick oven proof [[Frying pan|frying pan]] put on a gentle heat.\n| Ensure the mixture is evenly distributed and cook gently for about 5 minutes or until the [[Rice|rice]] [[Cake|cake]] has properly solidified.\n| You can leave it as it is or mix it up as its cooking, pressing it flat again before you finally grill it.\n| Preheat the [[Grill|grill]].\n| Pop the pan under the grill and grill for 10 minutes or until it is nicely browned.\n| Sprinkle with [[Lime juice|lime juice]] and serve immediately.\n}}\n\nInstead of fresh [[green chillies]], I have used 3/4 teaspoon of diced [[ancho]] & 3/4 teaspoon diced [[chipotle]] (dried) [[chillies]].\n\nI heeded [[Preparing a coconut|my own advice]] and tasted the coconut before preparing it.  It was totally rancid, thank you Morrisons.  Luckily I had both [[coconut flakes]] and [[desiccated coconut]]. For two people, I used two big handfuls of flakes and 4 tablespoons of [[desiccated coconut]] soaked in boiling water for 5 minutes then drained in a sieve.  It worked fine and saved the day!\n\n[[Image:Action coconut scraper with vacuum suction base.jpg|300px|thumb|right|An easier way to prepare the grated coconut - [http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00B7JDDL6?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o07_s00 Action coconut scraper with vacuum suction base - \u00a38.98 Amazon UK]]]\n\n===A better way of cooking this===\nAfter making variants of this for many years, I've discovered the best method of cooking is to spread the ingredients out on a lightly greased [[baking tray]] and bake at 220\u00b0 C (425\u00b0 F - gas 7) for 35 minutes, stirring up the contents every 10 minutes.  It might be an idea with a meat other than crayfish, to add the meat (or prawns) for the last 10 minutes so they don't dry out.\n[[Image:Crayfish & coconut chili, 1.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Baking tray method shown here with [[Crayfish and coconut rice cake with hot chillies]]]]\n\n{{Template:PeelingGinger}}\n{{Template:SeeAlso Roti}}\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Indian recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Spicy recipes]]\n[[Category:Chilli pepper recipes]]\n[[Category:Garlic recipes]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:Poultry recipes]]\n[[Category:Rice recipes]]\n[[Category:Favourite recipes]]\n[[Category:Boiled or simmered]][[Category:Pan fried]][[Category:Grilled, griddled or barbecued]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#rice #beef #limejuice #preparingacoconut #desiccatedcoconut #coriander #ghee #coconut #onions #murghiroti #spices </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"

It's nice - a one-pot rice dish.  Simples!</span> \n\n<span class=\"reviewAuthor\"> [[User:PSmith|Paul&nbsp;R&nbsp;Smith]] </span></span>\n}}\nJambalaya always brings to mind the Carpenters song; ''Jambalaya (On the Bayou)''  Not a Carpenters song but a dish traditionally made in one pot, with [[Meats|meats]] and [[Vegetables|vegetables]]. It is completed by adding [[Stock|stock]] and [[Rice|rice]].  Looking at various recipes in more detail, this strikes me now as a typical leftover dish.  Cooking up what you have around at the time.\n===Making this your own recipe===\nWhen I made this for the first time, not having the slightest idea what jambalaya was, it looked quite complex, however, having made it many times now I now think it is probably one of the easiest recipes around. It is also a brilliant recipe to adapt to your own personal taste.  It is also an excellent recipe for using up leftovers.\n\nJust follow a few basic steps and you will be able to make you own version of this recipe.\n* Rinse the rice in cold running water first.\n* Fry the onions, garlic and vegetables first, plus any meat that might need more cooking than the rice does.\n* Ensure the rice is well coated in the oil before adding any stock.\n* Measure the stock by doubling the volume of the rice (4 cups of water to 2 cups of rice, etc.)\n* Don't add all of the stock at once, add more if it looks as though it will dry out before the rice is done.\n* If you have ingredients that don't need much cooking (prawns etc.) or vegetables that you want to serve with a bit of a crunch then add them during the last five minutes of cooking.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 1 x 2kg (4 lb) [[Chicken|chicken]], [[Parson's nose|parson's nose removed]]\n| A few [[Bay leaf|bay leaves]]\n| 1 [[Onion|onion]], unpeeled, chopped into quarters\n| About 200 g from one or more of cooked meat\n| 40 g (1 &frac12; oz) [[Butter|butter]], [[ghee]] or [[olive oil]]\n| 4 to 7 [[Cloves garlic, peeled and crushed|cloves garlic, peeled and crushed]]\n| 6 [[Spring onions|spring onions]], [[Chopped on the diagonal|chopped on the diagonal]]\n| 2 sticks of [[Celery|celery]], 'strings' removed with a [[Mandoline|mandoline]] and chopped into moons\n| 3 or 4 sweet [[Bell peppers|bell peppers]], any colour, deseeded and chopped\n| 3 teaspoons [[Paprika powder|paprika powder]]\n| &#189; teaspoon of [[dried oregano]] or [[dried mixed herbs]]\n| 2 tablespoons fresh [[Basil leaves|basil leaves]], chopped, if available\n| 1 large can [[Plum|plum]] [[Tomatoes|tomatoes]], chopped\n| 500ml to 600 ml of the water the [[Chicken|chicken]] was [[Boiled|boiled]] in\n| 1 tablespoon [[Worcester sauce|Worcester sauce]]\n| [[Chillies]], [[chilli sauce]] or [[chilli powder]] to add warmth, not heat.\n|* I used: 1 teaspoon chili guajillo (powder), 2 teaspoons pasilla chili (diced), 1/2 a teaspoon of chipotle chillies (diced)\n|* Suggested alternative if using sauce: 1 to 2 tablespoons [[Louisiana hot pepper sauce]] (or to taste)\n| [[Sea Salt|sea salt]] and [[Freshly ground black pepper|freshly ground black pepper]]\n| 400 g (14 oz) [[Basmati rice|basmati rice]] ([[Long grain rice|long grain rice]])\n}}\n''' Garnish'''\n* Finely chopped [[Parsley|parsley]]\n\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Remove any giblets, cut off and discard the [[Parson's nose]].\n| Wash the [[Chicken|chicken]] under cold running water, inside and out\n| Place the [[Chicken|chicken]] in a large pot and pour over just enough [[Boiling|boiling]] water to cover\n| Add the [[Onion|onion]] and the [[Bay leaf|bay leaf]] and [[Boil|boil]] for about 1 hour or until tender\n| Set the [[Chicken|chicken]] to one side, reserve the [[Stock|stock]] and discard the [[Bay leaf|bay leaf]] and [[Onion|onion]] quarters\n| Once chicken has cooled discard skin and bone\n| Heat the [[Butter|butter]] in a large pan and [[Fry|fry]] the [[Garlic|garlic]] for a few minutes\n| Add the [[Ham|ham]], [[Spring onions|spring onions]], [[Celery|celery]] and [[Pepper|pepper]] and [[Saut\u00e9|saut\u00e9]] for 5 minutes\n| Rinse rice under cold running water for a few minutes until the water runs clear\n| Add the [[Rice|rice]] and [[Stir-fry|stir-fry]] for a minute so the grains are coated by the oil\n| Add the [[Stock|stock]] (about 500 ml to start), [[Tomatoes|tomatoes]], [[Spices|spices]], [[Worcester sauce|Worcester sauce]], [[Hot pepper sauce|hot pepper sauce]], [[Salt|salt]] and [[Pepper|pepper]] and [[Chicken|chicken]]\n| Stir well, cover and [[Simmer|simmer]] on a very low hob until the liquid has gone and the [[Rice|rice]] is cooked.  Add a little more water if it dries out before the rice is done.\n}}\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Chicken jambalaya in pot.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Chicken jambalaya, ready to cook\nImage:Chicken jambalaya boil.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Chicken, ready to boil\n</gallery>\n===Variations===\nI raided the garden for anything to add to the chicken boil: a few [[carrots]], some [[leeks]] a few spare sticks of [[celery]] and bunches of [[parsley]].\n===Chef's notes===\nI have doubled the rice quantity from the original recipe as there was so little rice.  I have not quite doubled the stock quantity so keep an eye on the water level to ensure that it does not dry out.\n\nRather than using [[chili sauce]] for the heat I used a mixture of my [[Exotic chili powders]] to add more than just heat.  The quantities I used did not make this hot (like a chili), just a little warmth.\n\nThe [[stock]] left from cooking the chicken is really good quality so whatever you don't use, freeze in bags or cups far later use.\n\n==See also==\n* http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jambalaya\n* http://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/1167651/chicken-and-chorizo-jambalaya\n* http://www.deliaonline.com/recipes/type-of-dish/one-pot-meals/chicken-jambalaya.html\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes|Jambalaya]]\n[[Category:Historic recipes|Jambalaya]]\n[[Category:Indian recipes|Jambalaya]]\n[[Category:Main courses|Jambalaya]]\n[[Category:Poultry recipes|Jambalaya]]\n[[Category:Rice recipes|Jambalaya]]\n[[Category:Spicy recipes|Jambalaya]]\n[[Category:Tex-Mex recipes|Jambalaya]]\n[[Category:North American recipes|Jambalaya]]\n[[Category:Favourite recipes]]\n[[Category:Boiled or simmered]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#chickenjambalaya #chicken #stock #onion #bayleaf #celery #rice #worchestersauce #ham #butter #parsley </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"

[[Cayenne pepper]], [[red chili powder]], or other spices give it a red hue. A higher amount of [[turmeric]] produces a yellow-orange colour. In some modern versions, [[Tandoori red food colouring]] is often used. It is traditionally cooked at high temperatures in an earthen oven (tandoor), but can also be prepared on a traditional grill or a very hot oven. This dish is also popular among Hindi, Bengali, and Urdu speaking Indian states like West Bengal & Andra Pradesh. In Pakistan it is eaten with [[naan breads]] and, in Bangladesh, with [[rice]].\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 450 g (1 lb) Skinless [[chicken]] breasts\n| &#189; teaspoon [[sea salt]]\n| &#189; teaspoon [[tandoori colouring]] (optional)\n| 2 cloves [[Garlic|garlic]], peeled and crushed\n| 1 thumb size piece of [[ginger]], peeled and grated finely - use any juice too.\n| &#189; teaspoon [[garam masala]]\n| &#189; teaspoon grated [[nutmeg]]\n| &#189; teaspoon [[chilli powder]]\n| &#189; teaspoon ground [[turmeric]]\n| 150g thick natural [[yogurt]] , about 150 g (5 oz) \n| 3 tablespoons [[vegetable oil]]\n| 4 sprigs [[coriander]]\n| Juice from and zest from a [[lemon]] or [[lime]]\n| Bamboo or wooden [[skewers]]\n}}\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Chicken tikka marinaded in a lock and lock box.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Marinaded chicken pieces, shaken not stirred!\nImage:Chicken tikka ready to marinate.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Chicken pieces ready to marinate, the easy way\n</gallery>\n\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Soak the skewers in cold water\n| Cut the [[chicken]] into 5 cm (2\") cubes\n| Place the cubed chicken in a bowl, add the [[lemon juice]] and the [[salt]] and mix well.

Rotate and return for a further 10 minutes\n| Remove from the oven and rest for 5 minutes before serving\n}}\n===Chef's tip===\nUse a [[Lock and Lock]] style box at the marinading stage to coat the chicken quickly and evenly.  Just add the chicken and the marinade to the [[Lock and Lock box]], close the lid and shake well.  It's then ready to go straight in the [[fridge]] and can be mixed by shaking every now and the.\n\n===Variations===\n\nServe with [[chicken tikka masala]]\n\nCook on a very hot [[barbecue]]\n\nYou can use whole [[chicken]] pieces in this recipe.\n\nCut slits in the [[chicken]] pieces and rub the [[marinade]] well into the chicken.\n\nYou can cook at the top of the oven [220\u00b0C (425\u00b0F) Gas 7] for about 25 minutes in total if using pieces.

All you need are [[Chicken|chicken]] pieces, a pot of [[Yogurt|yogurt]] and a jar of ready made ''[[Curry paste|curry paste]]''.  I've used vindaloo paste but you could use whatever you fancy.\n\nThe long you can leave the chicken pieces [[Marinading|marinading]], the better it will be.  I try to leave it a few days if I have managed to think that far ahead.\n\nThis will be cooked in an oven but could just as easily be cooked under a [[Grill|grill]], or on a [[barbecue]] grid or hot-plate.\n\nWe have a more authentic [[Chicken tikka|chicken tikka]] recipe here if you want to make it from scratch.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 4 [[Chicken|chicken]] legs and 4 [[chicken]] thighs (or similar selection)\n| 500g pot of [[Natural yogurt|natural yogurt]]\n| 3 tablespoons of your favourite [[Curry paste|curry paste]]\n| [[Lemon juice]] (optional)\n| [[Sea Salt|sea salt]] (optional)\n}}\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Chicken tikka (cheat)_resting.jpg|Rest for 4 minutes then serve\nImage:Chicken tikka (cheat)_ready_to_cook.jpg|After 2 days its ready to cook\nImage:Chicken tikka (cheat)_yogurt_curry_paste.jpg|Add the curry paste to the yogurt\nImage:Chicken tikka (cheat)_cut slashes.jpg|Cut deep slashes into the chicken pieces\nImage:Chicken tikka (cheat)_ingredients.jpg|Chicken tikka, the simplest of ingredients\n</gallery>\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| I like to remove the skin and trim any [[Fat|fat]].  The [[Marinade|marinade]] gets better penetration without the skin on and it's also a little healthier.\n| Cut 3 or 4 deep slashes down to the bone on each piece.  This ensures really good coverage of the [[Marinade|marinade]].\n| Optionally you can [[Marinade|marinade]] the [[Chicken|chicken]] pieces in [[Lemon juice|lemon juice]] and a good pinch of [[Salt|salt]] for a few hours before adding the [[Yogurt|yogurt]] [[Marinade|marinade]].  This [[Tenderise|tenderises]] the chicken.\n| Mix 2 to 3 tablespoons of your favourite [[Curry paste|curry paste]] into about two thirds of the [[Yogurt|yogurt]].  You don't need any more yogurt for this recipe so it leaves a little spare to make a [[Dip|dip]] or dressing to go with the [[Chicken|chicken]] pieces.\n| Add the [[Chicken|chicken]] pieces and the [[Marinade|marinade]] to a [[Lock and Lock]] style box.  replace the lid and shake like mad.\n| [[Refrigerate]] for a few days if possible shaking it now and then.\n| When you are ready to cook them, preheat the [[Oven|oven]] to 220\u00b0 C (425\u00b0 F - gas 7), [fan oven 200\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]\n| Cook on a grid over a foil-lined oven tray at the top of the [[Oven|oven]] for about 25 to 30 minutes, turning once. Check the chicken is properly cooked, rest for 4 or 5 minutes then serve.\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe with [[Plain rice|plain rice]], a simple [[Green salad|green salad]] and the remaining [[Yogurt|yogurt]] as a [[Dip|dip]].\n===Variations===\nStart with this [[Cheat|cheat]] recipe and tailor it to your liking by adding extra [[Garlic|garlic]], [[Chillies|chillies]], [[Ginger|ginger]], [[Herbs|herbs]] and [[Spices|spices]].

This is my variation on [[Murghi roti]] but using king prawns instead of chicken.\n\nTry this using two pans, see Chef's notes below.\n\nPlease be very careful if storing cooked [[Rice|rice]].  [[Refrigerate]] the moment it has cooled and use within 1 day\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 200 g (8 oz) uncooked [[basmati rice]].\n| 1 pack of [[king prawns]] - about 200 / 300 g\n| 2 tablespoons [[Ghee|ghee]] or vegetable [[Oil|oil]]\n| 5 [[Fat|fat]] [[Garlic cloves, peeled and crushed|garlic cloves, peeled and crushed]]\n| 5 cm (2\") [[Ginger|ginger]], peeled and roughly [[Grated|grated]]\n| 75 g (5 oz) [[Onions|onions]], peeled and finely chopped\n| 1 fresh [[coconut]], flesh [[Grated|grated]] - don't be too precise with the grating, it's quite nice to have some meaty chunks mixed in.\n| 4 hot [[Chilli peppers|chilli peppers]] (red or green), finely chopped - de-seeded if desired\n| 1 tablespoon [[Lime juice|lime juice]]\n| Fresh [[basil]] leaves, chopped or roughly torn.\n}}\n'''spices'''\n\n''don't grind the spices, leave them whole''\n* 2 teaspoons whole [[coriander seeds]]\n* 1 teaspoon whole [[cumin seeds]] (white)\n* 1/2 a teaspoon of whole [[fenugreek seeds]]\n* 1 teaspoon [[turmeric powder]]\n\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Quickly wash and drain the [[rice]] but don't rinse it as you normally would, this dish is best with rice of a starchy consistency. \n| Cook in boiling water for 7 to 11 minutes.\n| Rinse the cooked rice in cold water until it is cold.  Drain well.\n| Add the [[Rice|rice]] to a [[Food processor|food processor]] with a metal blade and blend to a thick creamy pur\u00e9e - adding a little milk if required to make it thinner.  Remember, the inside is not going to change much whilst being cooked and will remain at roughly the same consistency as it was when first mixed. \n| Heat the [[Ghee|ghee]] in a [[frying pan]] or [[Wok|wok]] and [[Stir-fry|stir-fry]] all of the [[Spices|spices]] for half a minute, then add the [[Ginger|ginger]] and [[Garlic|garlic]] and allow them to cook for a minute or so.\n| Add the [[Onion|onion]] and reduce the heat a little and let them cook until translucent; about 5 minutes.\n| Add the raw deveined [[king prawns]], [[Coconut|coconut]] and [[Chilli|chilli]] to the [[Onions|onions]], mix well and immediately remove from the heat.\n| Lightly [[Oil|oil]] a large non-stick oven proof [[Frying pan|frying pan]] put on a medium heat.\n| Add the [[prawn]] mix to the [[Rice|rice]] pur\u00e9e and tip this into the pan.\n| Ensure the mixture is evenly distributed and patted down, then cook for about 10 minutes or until the [[Rice|rice]] cake has properly solidified and the base has started to toast - a little burning is quite nice as it leaves a nice chewy, toasted flavour.\n| Preheat the [[Grill|grill]].\n| [[Brown|brown]] under the hot [[Grill|grill]] just to colour the top surface a little.\n| Sprinkle with [[Lime juice|lime juice]] and fresh [[basil]] leaves and serve immediately.\n}}\n===Chef's notes===\nHaving made this many, many times now, I'm coming to the conclusion that the best part is the glorious toasted crunchy outsides.  In future I will use two pans and made two thinner individual rotis.\n\nI heeded [[Preparing a coconut|my own advice]] and tasted the coconut before preparing it.  It was totally rancid, thank you Morrisons.  Luckily I had both [[coconut flakes]] and [[desiccated coconut]]. For two people, I used two big handfuls of flakes and 4 tablespoons of [[desiccated coconut]] soaked in boiling water for 5 minutes then drained in a sieve.  It worked fine and saved the day!\n\n===Variations===\nInstead of fresh [[green chillies]], I have used 3/4 teaspoon of diced [[ancho]] & 3/4 teaspoon diced [[chipotle]] (dried) [[chillies]].\n\nDoing a 'freezer clean out', we made a marvellous version of this with 1 [[chicken]] breast and a bag of cooked red kidney beans.  The chicken was thinly sliced and saut\u00e9ed with lots of crushed [[garlic]] and the kidney beans fried with the chicken and mashed down a little - rather like [[re-fried beans]].  This was added in place of the normally cooked chicken in this recipe.\n\n===A better way of cooking this===\nAfter making variants of this for many years, I've discovered the best method of cooking is to spread the ingredients out on a lightly greased [[baking tray]] and bake at 220\u00b0 C (425\u00b0 F - gas 7) for 35 minutes, stirring up the contents every 10 minutes.  It might be an idea with a meat other than crayfish, to add the meat (or prawns) for the last 10 minutes so they don't dry out.\n[[Image:Crayfish & coconut chili, 1.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Baking tray method shown here with [[Crayfish and coconut rice cake with hot chillies]]]]\n{{Template:SeeAlso Roti}}\n{{Template:PeelingGinger}}\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Indian recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Spicy recipes]]\n[[Category:Chilli pepper recipes]]\n[[Category:Garlic recipes]]\n[[Category:Fish recipes]]\n[[Category:Rice recipes]]\n[[Category:Favourite recipes]]\n[[Category:Boiled or simmered]][[Category:Pan fried]][[Category:Grilled, griddled or barbecued]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#chingrimalairoti #rice #kingprawns #garlic #basil #ghee #grill #limejuice #desiccatedcoconut #grated #ginger </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"

Remember, the texture is not going to change much whilst being cooked and will remain at roughly the same consistency as it was when first mixed. \n| Heat the [[Ghee|ghee]] in a [[frying pan]] or [[Wok|wok]] and [[Stir-fry|stir-fry]] all of the whole [[Spices|spices]] for half a minute, then add the [[Ginger|ginger]] and [[Garlic|garlic]] and allow them to cook for a minute or so.\n| Add the [[Onion|onion]] and reduce the heat a little and let them cook until translucent; about 5 minutes.\n| Add a little more [[oil]] or [[ghee]] if the mixture looks dry.\n| Add the whole [[crayfish tails]], [[Coconut|coconut]] and [[Chilli|chillies]] to the [[Onions|onions]], mix well and immediately remove from the heat.\n| Add all of the ingredients, apart from the tomatoes, fresh basil and lime juice to a large bowl and mix very well.\n| Carefully spread the mixture over the hot [[baking tray]]\n| Bake for 25 to 35 minutes, adding the [[tomatoes]] about half way through and stirring well every 10 minutes.\n| The nicest results are when the rice ''just'' crisps and gets a nice chewy, toasted flavour.

Take each sheet out one at a time to make a samosa.\n\nMix a little [[plain flour]] with a few drops of water into a paste which you can use to seal the final fold.\n\nIf you are making these for the first time, find somewhere comfortable where you can sit down while you make them. Put some music on, relax and practice with sheets of paper first!  If, when you are doing it for real, the pastry tears, discard the pastry (or fry on its own and scoff by yourself later) and then start again, otherwise all the contents will just spill out when you deep fry the [[samosas]].\n\n[[Deep fry]] in small batches (this prevents the temperature of the oil from falling too much/too quickly) for about 3 or 4 minutes or until they are golden brown.

The seedy naans shown were made with Allinson ''seed and grain bread flour'' instead of plain flour, and they were wonderful.

[[Refrigerate]] the moment it has cooled and use within 1 day\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 200 g (8 oz) uncooked [[basmati rice]].\n| 12 large raw [[king prawns]], deveined and each chopped into 3 pieces\n| 2 tablespoons [[Ghee|ghee]] or vegetable [[Oil|oil]]\n| 5 [[Fat|fat]] [[Garlic cloves, peeled and crushed|garlic cloves, peeled and crushed]]\n| 5 cm (2\") [[Ginger|ginger]], peeled and roughly [[Grated|grated]] - try making some [[Frozen ginger paste]], it is a good as fresh and lasts for years.\n| 75 g (5 oz) [[Onions|onions]], peeled and finely chopped\n| 1 whole [[Coconut|coconut]], flesh removed and roughly grated - see [[Action coconut scraper with vacuum suction base]] for the easy way to do this.\n| 4 hot [[Chilli peppers|chilli peppers]] (red or green), finely chopped - de-seeded if desired\n| 2 large tomatoes chopped into small pieces\n| 1 tablespoon [[Lime juice|lime juice]]\n}}\n'''spices'''\n\n''don't grind the spices, leave them whole''\n* 2 teaspoons whole [[coriander seeds]]\n* 1 teaspoon whole [[cumin seeds]] (white)\n* 1/2 a teaspoon of whole [[fenugreek seeds]]\n* 1 teaspoon [[turmeric powder]]\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:King prawn and coconut roti with tomatoes, chillies and ginger breakfast.jpg|Ready to serve with some left over for my breakfast!\nImage:King prawn and coconut roti with tomatoes, chillies and ginger browned.jpg|Browned under the grill\nImage:King prawn and coconut roti with tomatoes, chillies and ginger prawns.jpg|Prawns added, ready to grill\nImage:King prawn and coconut roti with tomatoes.jpg|Tomatoes mixed in; the rice cake is ready to [[pan-fry]]\n</gallery>\n\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Quickly wash and drain the [[rice]] but don't rinse it as you normally would, this dish is best with rice of a starchy consistency. \n| Cook in boiling water for 7 to 11 minutes.\n| Rinse the cooked rice in cold water until it is cold.  Drain well.\n| Add the [[Rice|rice]] and [[Coconut|coconut]] to a [[Food processor|food processor]] with a metal blade and blend to a thick creamy consistency - adding a little milk if required to make it thinner.  Remember, the inside is not going to change much whilst being cooked and will remain at roughly the same consistency as it was when first mixed. \n| Heat the [[Ghee|ghee]] in a [[frying pan]] or [[Wok|wok]] and [[Stir-fry|stir-fry]] all of the [[Spices|spices]] for half a minute, then add the [[Ginger|ginger]] and [[Garlic|garlic]] and allow them to cook for a minute or so.\n| Add the [[Onion|onion]] and reduce the heat a little and let them cook until translucent; about 5 minutes.\n| Add the [[Chilli|chilli]] to the [[Onions|onions]], mix well and immediately remove from the heat.\n| Preheat the [[Grill|grill]].\n| Lightly [[Oil|oil]] a large non-stick oven proof [[Frying pan|frying pan]] put on a medium heat.\n| Add the rice mixture to the hot pan and ensure the mixture is evenly distributed and patted down.  Distribute the chopped tomatoes evenly throughout the rice and coconut mixture.\n| Cook for about 10 minutes or until the [[Rice|rice]] cake starts to catch on the bottom, then mix it up well so you get lots of crispy bits.\n| Mix in the raw [[king prawns]] and pat down.\n| [[Brown|brown]] under the hot [[Grill|grill]] for about 5 minutes just to colour the top surface a little.\n| Sprinkle with [[Lime juice|lime juice]] and serve immediately.\n}}\n\n===Serving suggestions===\nThis is a perfect meal on its own though it can benefit from a few tablespoons of [[yogurt]] as a side dish if the [[chillies]] are really hot.  [[Peas]] and [[sweetcorn]] make a nice colourful accompaniment to this spicy recipe too.\n===A better way of cooking this===\nAfter making variants of this for many years, I've discovered the best method of cooking is to spread the ingredients out on a lightly greased [[baking tray]] and bake at 220\u00b0 C (425\u00b0 F - gas 7) for 35 minutes, stirring up the contents every 10 minutes.  It might be an idea with a meat other than crayfish, to add the meat (or prawns) for the last 10 minutes so they don't dry out.\n[[Image:Crayfish & coconut chili, 1.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Baking tray method shown here with [[Crayfish and coconut rice cake with hot chillies]]]]\n\n===Variations===\nAdd a splash of [[nam pla]] to the chopped prawns and let them [[marinade]] for a few hours for a more fishy taste.\n{{Template:SeeAlso Roti}}\n{{Template:PeelingGinger}}\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Indian recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Spicy recipes]]\n[[Category:Chilli pepper recipes]]\n[[Category:Garlic recipes]]\n[[Category:Fish recipes]]\n[[Category:Rice recipes]]\n[[Category:Favourite recipes]]\n[[Category:Boiled or simmered]][[Category:Pan fried]][[Category:Grilled, griddled or barbecued]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#kingprawnandcoconutrotiwithtomatoeschilliesandginger #rice #kingprawns #ginger #onions #coconut #grill #ghee #limejuice #tomatoes #chillies </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"

Originally it stated 10 g of dried chillies, crushed, in the marinade.   That equates to about 45 birds' eye chillies.  Too hot for me and I also have guests to consider.  For the chilli marinade, I've used 10g (16 x dried [[chili de arbole]], left whole.  I've also used [[Ancho chili powder]], which has a smokey hint.  None of which is the least bit authentic, but should make an interesting curry.\n\nThe resulting curry was reasonably hot, (about Madras strength).  If you want it hotter, I would suggest cutting the dried chillies in half.  That will allow more of the heat and flavour to mingle with the sauce.  If unsure, taste the sauce during cooking and if it starts to get too hot, remove some, or all of the chilles.\n\nAfter the frying stage, I  decided to use the [[slow cooker]] for the remaining cooking. As there was plenty of sauce, 2.5 hours on high made the lamb nice and tender, without overcooking. \n\nIf you want a more substantial sauce, stir in a few tablespoons of [[cornmeal]] 30 minutes before the ned of the cooking time.\n===Recipe source===\n\n* Adapted from 'Gypsy [[Meat|meat]]' (''Maas banjara'') from Mr Pushpash Pent's wonderful \"India\": ISBN 978-0714859026.\n{{Template:PeelingGinger}}\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Indian recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Spicy recipes]]\n[[Category:Lamb recipes]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:Boiled or simmered]]\n[[Category:Chilli pepper recipes]]\n[[Category:Garlic recipes]]\n[[Category:Slow cooker recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#marinade #lamb #lambadilambcurry #ghee #chiledearbole #garlicpaste #onions #ginger #gingerpaste #curry #anchochilipowder </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"

This is delicious, a succulent, flavoursome dish, with a perfect balance between sweet and sour. We've made it with beef too, and it was equally gorgeous.\n\nGenerally Keralans use a much lighter version of the [[Coconut milk|coconut milk]] we buy in tins in the UK. We've found that if you buy the reduced [[Fat|fat]] [[Coconut|coconut]] [[Milk|milk]], open the can without shaking it, pour off the liquid part and use that, it works well. Then you can dilute the remaining thicker half with a little water and [[Freeze|freeze]] it for next time.

While in Kerala and Tamilnadu, pachadi is a side-dish [[Curry|curry]] similar to the north Indian [[Raita]], in Andhra Pradesh, pachadi is a fresh [[Pickle|pickle]] and has very low shelf life, a maximum of two or three days. It is made of fresh [[Vegetables|vegetables]] and is served as an [[Accompaniment|accompaniment]] for [[Rice|rice]], [[Snacks|snacks]] like idli, [[Dosa|dosa]], pesarattu.\n\nIn Kerala and Tamilnadu states pachadi is eaten fresh and typically made of finely chopped and [[Boiled|boiled]] [[Vegetables|vegetables]] with [[Coconut|coconut]], green or [[Red chillies|red chillies]] and tempered in [[Oil|oil]] with [[Mustard seeds|mustard seeds]], [[Ginger|ginger]] and [[Curry leaves|curry leaves]]. [[Curd]]/[[Yogurt|yogurt]] based pachadi can be made of any [[Vegetable|vegetable]], although [[Cucumbers|cucumbers]], [[Squash|squash]], [[Mango|mango]], [[Bitter|bitter]] gourd or [[Pineapple|pineapple]] are common.

Not authentic, but healthier and tastier than sunflower oil.\n| [[Microwave]] for 1 to 2 minutes, checking progress as you go.\n| Remove only those that have fully [[Puffed|puffed]] up and continue until all are nice and puffy.\n| Leave to cool for 2 minutes after cooking because they don't become crisp until they have cooled down.\n}}\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Microwaved poppadoms in plastic bowl.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Arrange in a bowl (plastic is best)\nImage:Khanum Poppadoms.jpg|thumb|300px|right|[https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00TZT2EME/ref=ppx_od_dt_b_asin_title_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 Khanum Poppadoms Amazon uk - sometimes out of stock]\n</gallery>\n===Chef's notes===\nYou do not need special 'microwave poppadoms' for this recipe.  This works for any type of poppadom (or ''papadum'', if you so wish!).\n===The best poppadoms?===\nI've tried lots of different makes of poppadom, some good, some awful. One common problem is that they have a [[cabbage]] taste.  The best I've found (in the UK) are Khanum variety from Amazon (Prime).  They appear to go in and out of stock, but are worth hunting down.

Drain well.\n| Add the [[Rice|rice]] to a [[Food processor|food processor]] with a metal blade and blend to a thick creamy pur\u00e9e - adding a little milk if it needs thinning.  Remember, the inside is not going to change much whilst being cooked and will remain at roughly the same consistency as it was when first mixed. \n| Heat the [[Ghee|ghee]] in a [[Wok|wok]] or [[frying pan]] and [[Stir-fry|stir-fry]] all of the [[Spices|spices]] for half a minute, then add the [[Ginger|ginger]] and [[Garlic|garlic]] and allow them to cook for a minute or so.\n| Add the [[Onion|onion]] and reduce the heat a little and let them cook until translucent; about 5 minutes.\n| Add the [[Chicken|chicken]], [[Coconut|coconut]] and [[Chilli|chilli]] to the [[Onions|onions]], mix well and remove from the heat.\n| In a large bowl, mix everything together with the rice puree.\n| Lightly [[Oil|oil]] a large non-stick oven proof [[Frying pan|frying pan]] put on a medium heat.\n| Preheat the [[Grill|grill]].\n| Add the mixture from the bowl to the frying pan and pat down so it is flat\n| Ensure the mixture is evenly distributed and cook gently for about 10 minutes or until the [[Rice|rice]] [[Cake|cake]] has properly solidified.\n| If it catches on the bottom of the pan, use a pallet knife to turn areas of the mixture over, the more crunchy bits there are, the nicer it will taste. \n| After 10 minutes or so, finish the rice cake off under a hot grill to it's nicely toasted.\n| Sprinkle with [[Lime juice|lime juice]] and serve immediately.\n}}\n\n[[Image:Action coconut scraper with vacuum suction base.jpg|300px|thumb|right|An easier way to prepare the grated coconut - [http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00B7JDDL6?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o07_s00 Action coconut scraper with vacuum suction base - \u00a38.98 Amazon UK]]]\n\nInstead of fresh [[green chillies]], I have used 3/4 teaspoon of diced [[ancho]] & 3/4 teaspoon diced [[chipotle]] (dried) [[chillies]].\n\nDoing a 'freezer clean out', we made a marvellous version of this with 1 [[chicken]] breast and a bag of cooked red kidney beans.  The chicken was thinly sliced and saut\u00e9ed with lots of crushed [[garlic]] and the kidney beans fried with the chicken and mashed down a little - rather like [[re-fried beans]].  This was added in place of the normally cooked chicken in this recipe.\n\nThis recipe is great for using up the leftover Christmas [[turkey]].\n===Chef's notes===\nHaving made this many, many times now, I'm coming to the conclusion that the best part is the glorious toasted crunchy outsides.  In future I will use two pans and made two thinner individual rotis.\n\nI heeded [[Preparing a coconut|my own advice]] and tasted the coconut before preparing it.  It was totally rancid, thank you Morrisons.  Luckily I had both [[coconut flakes]] and [[desiccated coconut]]. For two people, I used two big handfuls of flakes and 4 tablespoons of [[desiccated coconut]] soaked in boiling water for 5 minutes then drained in a sieve.  It worked fine and saved the day!\n\n===A better way of cooking this===\nAfter making variants of this for many years, I've discovered the best method of cooking is to spread the ingredients out on a lightly greased [[baking tray]] and bake at 220\u00b0 C (425\u00b0 F - gas 7) for 35 minutes, stirring up the contents every 10 minutes.  It might be an idea with a meat other than crayfish, to add the meat (or prawns) for the last 10 minutes so they don't dry out.\n===Variations===\nSteamed chicken works well in this recipe - Follow the [[Chinese style steamed chicken]] using a quartered onion and a handful of fresh herbs instead of the Chinese ingredients \n\n[[Image:Crayfish & coconut chili, 1.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Baking tray method shown here with [[Crayfish and coconut rice cake with hot chillies]]]]\n\n{{Template:SeeAlso Roti}}\n{{Template:PeelingGinger}}\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Indian recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Spicy recipes]]\n[[Category:Chilli pepper recipes]]\n[[Category:Garlic recipes]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:Poultry recipes]]\n[[Category:Rice recipes]]\n[[Category:Favourite recipes]]\n[[Category:Boiled or simmered]][[Category:Pan fried]][[Category:Grilled, griddled or barbecued]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#murghiroti #rice #chicken #preparingacoconut #limejuice #desiccatedcoconut #garlic #ghee #onions #coconut #spices </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"

Oh, and its accompaniment - [[nectarines]]. A fantastic meal. \n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 225 g (8 oz) uncooked [[basmati rice]].\n| 200 ml [[coconut milk]]\n| 175 g (6 oz) cooked [[Chicken|chicken]] pieces - remove any [[bones]]\n| 2 tablespoons [[Ghee|ghee]] or vegetable [[Oil|oil]]\n| 5 [[Fat|fat]] [[Garlic cloves, peeled and crushed|garlic cloves, peeled and crushed]]\n| 5 cm (2\") [[Ginger|ginger]], peeled and roughly [[Grated|grated]]\n| 150 g (5 oz) [[Onions|onions]], peeled and finely chopped\n| 1 [[Coconut|coconut]], flesh removed and roughly grated\n|* see [[Preparing a coconut]]\n| 4 hot [[Chilli peppers|chilli peppers]] (red or green), finely chopped - de-seeded if desired\n| 1 tablespoon [[Lime juice|lime juice]]\n}}\n'''spices'''\n''The charm of this dish is the 'bite' of the whole spices, don't be tempted to grind them!''\n* 2 teaspoons whole [[coriander seeds]]\n* 1 teaspoon whole [[cumin seeds]] (white)\n* 1/2 a teaspoon of whole [[fenugreek seeds]]\n* 1 teaspoon [[turmeric powder]]\n\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Quickly wash and drain the [[rice]] but don't rinse it as you normally would, this dish is best with rice of a starchy consistency. \n| Cook in boiling water for 7 to 11 minutes.\n| Rinse the cooked rice in cold water until it is cold.  Drain well.\n| Add the [[Rice|rice]] to a [[Food processor|food processor]] with a metal blade together with 200 ml of [[coconut milk]] and blend to a thick creamy pur\u00e9e.  Remember, the inside is not going to change much whilst being cooked and will remain at roughly the same consistency as it was when first mixed. \n| Heat the [[Ghee|ghee]] in a [[frying pan]] or [[Wok|wok]] and [[Stir-fry|stir-fry]] all of the [[Spices|spices]] for half a minute, then add the [[Ginger|ginger]] and [[Garlic|garlic]] and allow them to cook for a minute or so.\n| Add the [[Onion|onion]] and reduce the heat a little and let them cook until translucent; about 5 minutes.\n| Add the [[Chicken|chicken]], [[Coconut|coconut]] and [[Chilli|chilli]] to the [[Onions|onions]], mix well and remove from the heat.\n| In a large bowl, mix everything together.\n| Lightly [[Oil|oil]] a large non-stick oven proof [[Frying pan|frying pan]] put on a medium heat.\n| Preheat the [[Grill|grill]].\n| Add the mixture from the bowl to the frying pan and pat down so it is flat\n| Ensure the mixture is evenly distributed and cook gently for about 10 minutes or until the [[Rice|rice]] [[Cake|cake]] has properly solidified.\n| If it catches on the bottom of the pan, use a pallet knife to turn areas of the mixture over, the more crunchy bits there are, the nicer it will taste. \n| After 10 minutes or so, finish the rice cake off under a hot grill to it's nicely toasted.\n| Sprinkle with [[Lime juice|lime juice]] and serve immediately.\n}}\n\n[[Image:Action coconut scraper with vacuum suction base.jpg|300px|thumb|right|An easier way to prepare the grated coconut - [http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00B7JDDL6?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o07_s00 Action coconut scraper with vacuum suction base - \u00a38.98 Amazon UK]]]\n\nDoing a 'freezer clean out', we made a marvellous version of this with 1 [[chicken]] breast and a bag of cooked red kidney beans.  The chicken was thinly sliced and saut\u00e9ed with lots of crushed [[garlic]] and the kidney beans fried with the chicken and mashed down a little - rather like [[re-fried beans]].  This was added in place of the normally cooked chicken in this recipe.\n===A better way of cooking this===\nAfter making variants of this for many years, I've discovered the best method of cooking is to spread the ingredients out on a lightly greased [[baking tray]] and bake at 220\u00b0 C (425\u00b0 F - gas 7) for 35 minutes, stirring up the contents every 10 minutes.  It might be an idea with a meat other than crayfish, to add the meat (or prawns) for the last 10 minutes so they don't dry out.\n[[Image:Crayfish & coconut chili, 1.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Baking tray method shown here with [[Crayfish and coconut rice cake with hot chillies]]]]\n\n===Chef's notes===\nSteamed chicken works well in this recipe - Follow the [[Chinese style steamed chicken]] using a quartered onion and a handful of fresh herbs instead of the Chinese ingredients.\n{{Template:SeeAlso Roti}}\n{{Template:PeelingGinger}}\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Indian recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Spicy recipes]]\n[[Category:Chilli pepper recipes]]\n[[Category:Garlic recipes]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:Poultry recipes]]\n[[Category:Rice recipes]]\n[[Category:Favourite recipes]]\n[[Category:Boiled or simmered]][[Category:Pan fried]][[Category:Grilled, griddled or barbecued]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#chicken #rice #limejuice #garlic #nectarines #ghee #murghirotiwithnectarinesandextracoconut #coconut #onions #coconutmilk #spices </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"

The difference between perfect naan breads and a brown biscuit is about 30 seconds.\n| They should have a crunch on the outside and a soft spongy inside.\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\n\nServe hot, brushed with melted [[butter]].\n\n===Using a bread maker===\n\nIf you have a breadmaker, tip all of the ingredients into it, set it on a long (2:20) dough setting and start at step 3 above.  It could not be easier.\n\nFor the [[Breadmaker|Panasonic SD 253 breadmaker]], use basic dough setting.\n\n'''For the [[Panasonic SD-ZB2502 automatic breadmaker]] use menu option 16, basic dough.'''\n\n===Variations===\n\nExperiment with various flours.  The seedy naans shown were made with Allinson ''seed and grain bread flour'' instead of plain flour, and they were wonderful. You could of course, just add a handful of mixed grain (barley flakes, kibbled rye, sunflower seeds, millet and linseed) to normal flour.\n\nWe've found that by leaving them rise a little in a warm place such as on our fire, pictured, makes them puff up more that they do if you bake them immediately. They are even nicer this way and we now use naans as a preference to [[pittas]].   20 minutes is an ideal time for this, if you leave them any longer they achieve a very bready consistency and are not as nice.  Experiment!  \n\n===Chef's tip===\n\nUse a [[pizza stone]] if you have one for even better results.\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Indian recipes]]\n[[Category:Bread and baking]]\n[[Category:Breadmaker recipes]]\n[[Category:Accompaniments]]\n[[Category:Favourite recipes]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#naanbread #dough #butter #naturalyogurt #miseenplace #pizzastone #pittas #muslin #yoghurt #driedyeast #bakingpowder </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"

Leave to cool, then grind to a coarse powder in a [[Mortar and pestle|mortar and pestle]]. Add the [[Ginger|ginger]] and [[Nutmeg|nutmeg]] and mix well. Rub the mixture evenly into the flesh side of the four [[Fish|fish]] fillets, sprinkle some on a plate, and leave them skin side up on top. Set aside \n| To make the masala mix for the [[Sauce|sauce]], [[Roast|roast]] the [[Cardamom|cardamom]], [[Cinnamon|cinnamon]], [[Bay leaves|bay leaves]], [[Cloves|cloves]] and [[Star anise|star anise]] in a dry, heavy bottomed [[Frying pan|frying pan]] for about 4 minutes, until they are fragrant. Leave to cool, then grind to a very fine powder in a [[Spice|spice]] grinder or [[Blender|blender]]. Add the powdered [[Coriander|coriander]], [[Fennel seeds|fennel seeds]] and [[Cumin|cumin]], and give a final blitz to mix the [[Spices|spices]]. Set aside. \n| To make the [[Sauce|sauce]], heat the [[Oil|oil]] in a large [[Frying pan|frying pan]] or [[Wok|wok]] and add the [[Onions|onions]] and [[Cinnamon|cinnamon]]. [[Fry]] gently for about 10 mins, or the [[Onion|onion]] is soft and translucent, then add the [[Cardamom|cardamom]], [[Cloves|cloves]], [[Mustard seeds|mustard seeds]] and [[Bay leaf|bay leaf]]. When the [[Mustard|mustard]] [[Seeds|seeds]] begin to crackle, add the [[Curry leaves|curry leaves]], [[Ginger|ginger]], [[Turmeric|turmeric]], [[Chilli powder|chilli powder]] and a tablespoon of the masala mix (the [[Rest|rest]] will keep well in an airtight container in a cupboard). Stir for one minute, then add the [[Tomato|tomato]] and [[Salt|salt]], and cook till soft. Add the [[Coconut milk|coconut milk]] and [[Simmer|simmer]] gently for 20 minutes. Then add the [[Tamarind paste|tamarind paste]], and [[Simmer|simmer]] for 3 minutes. Then [[Sieve|sieve]] into a small saucepan and remove from the heat. Set aside and keep warm \n| [[Steam]] and drain the [[Spinach|spinach]] \n| To cook the [[Fish|fish]], heat the [[Ghee|ghee]] in a heavy bottomed [[Frying pan|frying pan]], add the [[Fish|fish]], skin side down, and cook over a low to medium heat for about 5 minutes, [[Basting|basting]] with melted [[Butter|butter]] as you do. Then turn over, and cook for another 4 minutes, still [[Basting|basting]] \n}}\n===Serving suggestion===\nPut a puddle of the [[Sauce|sauce]] on each of four plates and carefully place a fillet on top, skin side up. Put a spoonful of [[Spinach|spinach]] on one side and a decent sized blob of [[Yoghurt|yogurt]] on the other, scatter a couple of whole [[Coriander leaves|coriander leaves]], and serve.\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Indian recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Spicy recipes]]\n[[Category:Fish recipes]]\n[[Category:Sea fish recipes]]\n[[Category:Nik and Edwina's Cookbook recipes]]\n[[Category:Pan fried]]\n[[Category:Recipes from other sites]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#fish #sauce #spice #turmeric #basting #ginger #nutmeg #cinnamonstick #roast #staranise #fennelseeds </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"

In North India, the [[lentil]] variety is more popular and is usually called 'papad'. [[Salt]] and [[peanut oil]] are added to make a [[dough]], which can be flavoured with seasonings such as [[chili]], [[cumin]], [[Garlic|garlic]] or [[black pepper]]. Sometimes [[baking soda]] is also added. The [[dough]] is shaped into a thin, round flat bread and then dried (traditionally in the sun) and can be cooked by [[deep-frying]], [[roasting]] over an open flame, toasting, or microwaving, depending on the desired texture.\n\nPapadums are typically served as an accompaniment to a meal in India.

Although this recipe refers to the [[Shellfish|shellfish]] as [[Prawns|prawns]], they are actually [[Shrimps|shrimps]], much smaller than prawns.\n\nThis version is made using [[Dried shrimps|dried shrimps]], which you can get from any oriental wholesaler.  Although they are [[Dried|dried]], you will find them in the chill cabinet and need to be kept [[Refrigerated|refrigerated]].  They are worth buying as they are a great addition to [[Special fried rice|special fried rice]].\n\nSoak the [[dried shrimp]] for an hour in just-[[Boiled|boiled]] water to rehydrate them. This also helps to wash off any dust and excess salt.\n\nLeave for a few weeks to mature, this [[Pickle|pickle]] is great as a [[Condiment|condiment]] and even makes a great spread for sandwiches if you like it hot!\n\n===Prawn balchao as meal===\nI have had a requests from people for a prawn balchao ''meal'' recipe, rather than one for a pickle.  I'm afraid that I have not been able to find any recipes that refer to prawn balchao as a finished dish.  Even the wonderful \"India\" - Mr Pushpash Pent:  ISBN 978-0714859026 states: \"The dish is know for it's piquant character: It is more like a pickle relish and is consumed in moderation\".\n\nIf anyone has any helpful information that may clear up this confusion, please do drop me a note via the ''Contact the Editor'' link above.--[[User:Chef|Jerry, aka Chef]] 18:14, 10 December 2012 (UTC)\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 100 g [[Dried shrimp|dried shrimp]]\n| 1 large [[Onion|onion]], peeled and chopped\n| 5 cm (2\") piece if [[Ginger|ginger]], peeled and finely chopped\n| 1 whole bulb of [[Garlic]], peeled and crushed\n| 4 tablespoons [[Tomato|tomato]] pur\u00e9e\n| 140 ml [[Vegetable oil|vegetable oil]]\n| 1 teaspoon [[Nigella|nigella]] [[Seeds|seeds]]\n| 1 teaspoon [[Turmeric powder|turmeric powder]]\n| 1 teaspoon to 1 tablespoon [[Freshly ground black pepper|freshly ground black pepper]] - see Chef's notes\n| 1 to 2 tablespoons [[Chilli powder|chilli powder]]\n| 1 to 2 tablespoons [[Cooking salt|cooking salt]]\n| 3 tablespoons [[Jaggery|jaggery]], ([[White sugar|white sugar]] is fine)\n| 300 ml [[Malt vinegar|malt vinegar]]\n| Lime juice to taste\n\n}}\n\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n* Rinse the [[Dried shrimp|dried shrimp]] and leave to rehydrate for a few hours in just-[[Boiled|boiled]] water.

I made this batch with 1 tablespoon of black pepper but next time I would probably only use 1 teaspoon of black pepper.\n\nI no longer keep fresh [[ginger]], instead I buy in bulk from the ethnic supermarket and make my own [[very lazy ginger]] on a huge scale.  As I use it up I am left with pints of [[ginger]] flavoured [[white wine vinegar]] so in this recipe I used that instead of [[malt vinegar]].\n\nI also used Turkish [[chilli flakes]] instead of [[chilli powder]].\n{{Template:PeelingGinger}}\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Indian recipes]]\n[[Category:Accompaniments]]\n[[Category:Dips and sauces]]\n[[Category:Pickles and preserves]]\n[[Category:Spicy recipes]]\n[[Category:Chilli pepper recipes]]\n[[Category:Fish recipes]]\n[[Category:Shellfish recipes]]\n[[Category:Favourite recipes]]\n[[Category:Boiled or simmered]]\n[[Category:Pickled]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#ginger #driedshrimp #chillipowder #garlic #shrimps #prawns #maltvinegar #nigella #seeds #prawnbalchaopickle #pickle </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
