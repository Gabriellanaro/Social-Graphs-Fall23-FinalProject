It has an effect on [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutathione Glutathione (Wikipedia)] which has an affect on the the elasticity of the dough. \n\nIt has a bitter-sweet toffee flavour, almost like a sweet malt bread.\n\nThis is my version which has additional rye flour and is adapted to suit a bread making machine.\n\n'''Use menu 08 ''French bake'' (6 hour)''' on [[Panasonic SD-ZB2502 automatic breadmaker]])\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 2.5 teaspoons [[Dried active yeast|dried active yeast]].\n| 1 [[vitamin C]] tablet, crushed to a powder.\n| 430 g very strong [[Wholemeal flour|wholemeal flour]].\n| 70 g [[wholegrain]] [[Rye flour|rye flour]].\n| 3.5 teaspoons [[black treacle]] or [[Molasses|molasses]].\n| 2 teaspoons [[Salt|salt]].\n| 400 ml water - or by weight instead of volume, 400 g water.\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Place all of the ingredients in the [[Bread maker|bread maker]] in the above order.\n| Panasonic SD-253/4/5 [[Bread maker|bread maker]].\n| Set to gluten free bake (2 hours)\n| Remove as soon as [[Baked|baked]] and cool on a wire rack.\n}}\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Ballymaloe brown bread recipe.jpg|Ballymaloe brown bread\nImage:Jerry's Irish bread.jpg|Ballymaloe brown bread - using the French setting and recipe\n</gallery>\n==French setting and recipe==\n[[User:JuliaBalbilla|JuliaBalbilla]] experimented with this recipe and made a very successful Ballymaloe Brown Bread loaf using the following recipe and ''French Bake'' setting on her Panasonic SD-255.\n\n===Ingredients===\n*3.5 teaspoons [[dried active yeast]]\n* 1 crushed 250 g [[vitamin C tablet]]\n* 425 g [[wholemeal flour]]\n* 75 g [[wholegrain]] [[rye flour]]\n* 1 teaspoon of [[molasses]]\n* 2 teaspoons of [[salt]]\n* 400 ml water\n\n===Method===\n# Place all of the ingredients in the [[Bread maker|bread maker]] in the above order.\n# Panasonic SD-253/4/5 [[Bread maker|bread maker]].\n# Set to ''French Bake'' (6 hours)\n# Use menu 08 ''French bake'' (6 hour) on [[Panasonic SD-ZB2502 automatic breadmaker]]\n# Remove as soon as [[Baked|baked]] and cool on a wire rack.\n\n===Notes===\nIf you don't have a gluten free bake setting, look for a fairly short [[Kneading bread|knead]] and rest time with a long bake time.  I found with other settings, the bread would rise extremely well, but after being [[knocked down]] (by the breadmaker), it never managed to rise again properly.  The failures make brilliant breadcrumbs though!\n==See also==\n{{Wholemeal bread recipes-See also}}\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Bread and baking]]\n[[Category:Breadmaker recipes]]\n[[Category:Irish recipes]]\n[[Category:Snacks and light bites]]\n[[Category:Starters]]\n[[Category:Vegan recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#ballymaloebrownbread #breadmaker #wholemealflour #ryeflour #wholegrain #molasses #driedactiveyeast #vitaminc #kneadingbread #baked #blacktreacle </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
