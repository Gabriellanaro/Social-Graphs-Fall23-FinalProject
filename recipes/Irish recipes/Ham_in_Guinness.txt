Also excellent in sandwiches.\n\n===Chef's notes===\nYou can use any size [[Ham|ham]] you wish and adjust the amount of the other ingredients accordingly.  However, you will also need to re-calculate the [[Boiling|boiling]] time by about 50 minutes per kg.  You may not need to soak the ham first if you buy one ready prepared. \n\nWhen cooking this, I adjusted the original recipe to match my tastes.  I do not like [[cloves]], but I love [[chillies]].  For the final roast and baste I used marmalade mixed with the boiling juices and a good teaspoon of smoky [[chipotole chilli powder]] for a little bite.\n{{Template:ThinkPig}}\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes|Ham in guinness]]\n[[Category:Cooking with beer]]\n[[Category:Irish recipes|Ham in guinness]]\n[[Category:Main courses|Ham in guinness]]\n[[Category:Pork recipes|Ham in guinness]]\n[[Category:Snacks and light bites|Ham in guinness]]\n[[Category:Boiled or simmered]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#haminguinness #ham #marmalade #guinness #mace #boil #miseenplace #vegetables #chipotolechillipowder #brownsugar #boiling </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
