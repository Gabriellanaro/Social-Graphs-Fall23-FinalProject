Just [[Meat|meat]], [[Potatoes|potatoes]] and [[Onion|onion]] - no [[Barley|barley]] or other veg. You can cook this either on the [[Hob|hob]] or in the [[Oven|oven]].\n[[Image:Irish Stew, ready for the oven.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Irish Stew, ready for the oven]]\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| 1 kg [[Lamb - suitable cooking methods|scrag end of lamb]] or [[Mutton|mutton]], cut into cutlets and [[Fat|fat]] trimmed\n| 1.8 kg [[Potatoes|potatoes]], peeled and cut in half or quarters, depending on size\n| 500 g [[Brown|brown]] [[Onions|onions]], thickly sliced\n| Seasoning\n| 570 ml [[Meat stock|meat stock]] (hot [[Stock|stock]] if cooking in the [[Oven|oven]])\n| A [[Sprig of rosemary|sprig of rosemary]]\n| A few sprigs of [[Thyme|thyme]]\n| 2 [[Bay leaves|bay leaves]]\n}}\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n\n* If cooking in the [[Oven|oven]], pre-heat to 150\u00b0C (fan 130\u00b0C) / 300\u00b0 F / Gas 2\n\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| Take a deep [[Saucepan|saucepan]] or [[Casserole|casserole]], depending on how you want to cook it and add a layer of half the [[Potatoes|potatoes]], then the [[Meat|meat]], and then the [[Rest|rest]] of the potatoes, seasoning well between layers.\n| Add the remaining ingredients.\n| Firstly cover the pan with some greased [[Tin foil|tin foil]], and put the lid on.\n}}\n====For cooking on the hob====\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Bring to a gentle [[Boil|boil]], reduce the heat and [[Simmer|simmer]] gently for 2-2\u00bd hours.  As the pan is so tightly covered, you may find a heat diffuser useful.  Also you need to shake the pan at times, to prevent sticking.\n}}\n====For cooking in the oven====\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Place the [[Casserole|casserole]] into the pre-heated [[Oven|oven]] and cook for 3 hours (possibly a bit less for fan).\n| In either case, the [[Stew|stew]] should not be too liquidy - it is not [[Soup|soup]] - and the [[Potatoes|potatoes]] will [[Help|help]] to thicken it up.\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe with [[Soda bread|soda bread]] or other rustic [[Bread|bread]]\n===Recipe source===\n\n* Adapted from a recipe in '''The Constance Spry Cookery Book''' (1956) by Constance Spry and [[Rosemary]] Hume\n\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Irish recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Lamb recipes]]\n[[Category:Mutton recipes]]\n[[Category:Potato recipes]]\n[[Category:Stews and casseroles]]\n[[Category:Stewed, braised or pot roasted]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#potatoes #casserole #traditionalirishstew #barley #tinfoil #saucepan #sprigofrosemary #rest #hob #onion #stock </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
