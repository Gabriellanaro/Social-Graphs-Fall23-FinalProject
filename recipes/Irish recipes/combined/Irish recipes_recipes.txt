At the time and throughout the medieval period, Waterford was a powerful trading city; leather, [[wheat]], [[flour]], [[butter]] and other agricultural produce from the area around Waterford were shipped to and from England and the continent mainly to Spain, France and Italy. During the civil war records were destroyed, therefore, oral history dictates that in 1685, a large section of French Protestants were exiled to whatever countries gave them shelter, including England and Ireland. Waterford became a point of attraction to French refugees due to its ease of access; it placed them within convenient distance of their own shores, should circumstances make their return desirable; and it afforded a port of trade capable of developing the mercantile abilities of the most enterprising.  According to the oral tradition of the period, the Huguenots introduced a bread product made from left over pieces of dough in the late 17th century. Waterford bakers believe that when the Huguenots introduced the \u2018Waterford Blaa\u2019, it was called \u2018blaad\u2019 or \u2018blanc\u2019, and as the product gained in popularity, the Huguenot bakers began making dough specifically for its manufacture. The \u2018blaad\u2019 or \u2018blanc\u2019 was later corrupted to \u2018Blaa\u2019, a name which exists to the present day. \n\nDuring the early 19th century, it gained popularity, chiefly among the poor, when the founder of the Christian Brothers, brother Edmund Ignatius Rice (1762-1844) began baking the \u2018Waterford Blaa\u2019 at his own bakery in Mount Sion in Waterford City, in 1802. The simplicity of the basic ingredients made it cheap and popular with the local population. The skills required to produce it are specialised and have been passed on from the Huguenots. The tough dough requires a lot of handling, is hand floured at least three times during the various stages of production and the final product before baking is flattened by hand; this ensures that the product cannot be produced solely by machine and that the texture and flavour of the product is consistent.\n\nUnlike other products in this category, \u2018Waterford Blaa\u2019 contains no preservatives or enrichment and is made solely from preservative-free strong bakers\u2019 [[flour]], table [[salt]], compressed [[yeast]], dough conditioner and water. The addition of [[flour]] gives the product the white finish on top which results in the rough cracked appearance of the \u2018Waterford Blaa\u2019, which is a characteristic of the product. As they are not baked with steam, the heavy dusting of [[flour]] is both for protection from oven heat and to enhance the appearance. Throughout the production process of there is excessive use of [[flour]], at pinning, resting, etc. There can also be [[flour]] on the base. They are characteristically not uniform in shape and size. The dough that is used to make it is tougher and does not contain as much water as other products. It is baked for longer, producing a stronger crust which contains the distinctive [[malt]] flavour. The flattening by hand process that the producers undertake ensures the irregular shape and distinctive features. It is a popular breakfast product usually baked during the night and sold as a [[bread]] product normally eaten with [[butter]] or as a mid-day snack to make sandwiches with a variety of fillings, including [[fried]] [[potatoes]], dillsk, Irish fillet [[steak]] and relish. However, it is a popular belief that \u2018Waterford Blaa\u2019 is best when torn apart by hand and eaten fresh, straight from the bakery.\n\nReference [http://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/quality/door/registeredName.html?denominationId=5663 The European Commission]\n\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 500g [[Strong white flour|strong white flour]], plus extra for dusting\n| 10g [[Salt|salt]]\n| 20g fresh [[Yeast|yeast]] or 2 teaspoons [[Dried active yeast|dried active yeast]].\n| 10g [[Sugar|sugar]]\n| 275g lukewarm water\n\n}}\n\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n* Preheat the [[Oven|oven]] to 220\u00b0 C (425\u00b0 F - gas 7)\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| [[Sieve]] the dry ingredients.\n| Dissolve [[Yeast|yeast]] and [[Sugar|sugar]] into water and leave for 10 minutes in a [[warm place]] to activate. \n| Add wet to dry ingredients, mix until combined.\n| Knead until [[Dough|dough]] is smooth and elastic.\n| Prove for 45 minutes in a [[warm place]], covered with a damp cloth.\n| [[Knock back]].\n| Rest for 15mins.

The dish is mostly associated with the north midlands, north Connacht and southern Ulster, in particular the counties of Mayo, Sligo, Donegal (where it is know locally as '''Poundy''' or '''Poundies'''), Fermanagh, Leitrim and Cavan. \n\nThere are many different recipes but all contain finely grated, raw [[potatoes]] and all are served [[fried]]. The most popular version of the dish consists of finely grated, raw [[potato]] and [[mashed potato]] with [[flour]], [[baking soda]], [[buttermilk]] and sometimes [[egg]]. The grated potato may be strained to remove most of the starch and water but this is not necessary. The mixture is fried on a [[griddle pan]] for a few minutes on each side, similar to a normal [[pancake]]. Traditional alternatives include using only raw potatoes, boiling it as a [[dumpling]] or [[baking]] it as a loaf. The most noticeable difference between boxty and other fried potato dishes is its smooth, fine grained consistency.\n====Traditional limmerick:====\n<code>\n\"Boxty on the griddle,\n\nBoxty in the pan,\n\nIf you can't make boxty,\n\nYou'll never get a man.\"\n</code>\n\nServed at [[Tea|tea]]-time, these [[Potato|potato]] cakes can also be [[Fried|fried]] up to accompany [[Bacon|bacon]] and [[Eggs|eggs]] for breakfast\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 115 g [[Plain flour|plain flour]]\n| &frac12; teaspoon [[Baking powder|baking powder]]\n| &frac12; [[Salt|salt]]\n| 50 g [[Butter|butter]]\n| 450 g [[Potatoes|potatoes]], peeled and [[Boiled|boiled]]\n| 30 ml [[Milk|milk]]\n\n}}\n\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n* Preheat [[Oven|oven]] to 220\u00b0 C (425\u00b0 F - gas 7)\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| [[Sieve]] the dry ingredients and rub in the [[Butter|butter]].\n| [[Mash]] the [[Potatoes|potatoes]] with the [[Milk|milk]] and add to the [[Flour|flour]] mixture.\n| Bind the mixture together and divide into several balls.\n| Flatten the balls so that they are only 5 mm thick.\n| [[Bake]] in the [[Oven|oven]] for 20 minutes.\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe hot and spread with [[Butter|butter]].

You may not need to soak the ham first if you buy one ready prepared. \n\nWhen cooking this, I adjusted the original recipe to match my tastes.  I do not like [[cloves]], but I love [[chillies]].  For the final roast and baste I used marmalade mixed with the boiling juices and a good teaspoon of smoky [[chipotole chilli powder]] for a little bite.\n{{Template:ThinkPig}}\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes|Ham in guinness]]\n[[Category:Cooking with beer]]\n[[Category:Irish recipes|Ham in guinness]]\n[[Category:Main courses|Ham in guinness]]\n[[Category:Pork recipes|Ham in guinness]]\n[[Category:Snacks and light bites|Ham in guinness]]\n[[Category:Boiled or simmered]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#haminguinness #ham #marmalade #guinness #mace #boil #miseenplace #vegetables #chipotolechillipowder #brownsugar #boiling </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"

I find wholemeal flour in these quite hard to digest and spelt flour made all the difference.</span> \n\n<span class=\"reviewAuthor\"> [[User:PSmith|Paul&nbsp;R&nbsp;Smith]] </span></span>\n}}\nSoda [[Bread|bread]], (Scotland: Scofa '''Sco'''ttish '''fa'''rl)  - is a type of quick bread in which [[Baking soda|baking soda]] (otherwise known as [[Sodium bicarbonate|sodium bicarbonate]]) is used for [[Leavening|leavening]] rather than the more common [[Yeast|yeast]]. The ingredients of traditional soda bread are [[Flour|flour]], [[Bread soda|bread soda]], [[Salt|salt]], and [[Buttermilk|buttermilk]]. Other ingredients can be added such as [[Raisins|raisins]], [[Egg|egg]] or various forms of [[Nuts|nuts]].\n\nThe [[Buttermilk|buttermilk]] in the [[Dough|dough]] contains [[Lactic acid|lactic acid]], which reacts with the [[Baking soda|baking soda]] to form tiny bubbles of carbon dioxide. Soda [[Bread|bread]] can dry out quickly and is typically good for two to three days; it is best served warm or [[Toasted|toasted]]. In Ireland, typically the [[Flour|flour]] is made from soft [[Wheat|wheat]]; so soda bread is best made with a cake or [[Pastry|pastry]] flour (made from soft wheat), which has lower levels of [[Gluten|gluten]] than a bread flour.\n\nVarious forms of soda [[Bread|bread]] are popular throughout Ireland. Soda [[Breads|breads]] are made using either wholemeal or [[White flour|white flour]], with the former known colloquially as \"[[Brown|brown]] bread\" in the Republic of Ireland. In Northern Ireland the wholemeal variety is known as \"wheaten bread\" and normally sweetened, while the term \"soda bread\" is restricted to the white savoury form normally served [[Fried|fried]]. The two major shapes are the loaf and the \"[[Griddle|griddle]] cake\", or [[Farl|farl]] in Northern Ireland. The loaf form takes a more rounded shape and has a cross cut in the top to allow the bread to expand. The griddle cake or farl, is a more flattened type of bread. It is cooked on a griddle allowing it to take a more flat shape and split into four sections.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| [[Olive oil]] for greasing\n| 250 g (9 oz) [[Plain flour|plain flour]]\n| 1 level teaspoon [[Bicarbonate of soda|bicarbonate of soda]]\n| 1 level teaspoon [[Salt|salt]]\n| 2 teaspoons  [[Brown sugar|brown sugar]]\n| 225 ml (8 fl oz) [[Buttermilk|buttermilk]] or live [[Yoghurt|yogurt]]\n\n}}\n\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n* Preheat the [[Oven|oven]] to 230\u00b0 C (450\u00b0 F - gas 8) and place a [[baking stone]] or [[pizza stone]] towards the top of the oven with enough room for the loaf to rise.\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Soda bread baking stone.jpg|thumb|300px|right|On the [[baking stone]], ready to bake\nImage:Soda bread ingredients.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Soda bread ingredients - [[spelt flour]] version\n</gallery>\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| '''Important''':  Ensure that the oven already at the right temperature before you start.  This loaf needs no [[proving]] as the [[baking powder]] or [[bicarbonate of soda]] aerates the bread in place of the yeast, however, its action begins once it reacts with moisture, you may loose the 'rise' if you have to wait for the over to warm up.\n| Sift the [[Flour|flour]], [[Salt|salt]] and soda in a mixing bowl and add the [[Sugar|sugar]].\n| Stir in the [[Yoghurt|yogurt]] or [[Buttermilk|buttermilk]] with a spoon at first, then once amalgamated, with your hands\n| The consistency should be pliable and firm, not sticky.\n| Knead the [[Dough|dough]] lightly in the bowl for a few minutes  then shape it into a ball.\n| Cut a cross in the top of the loaf to enable the loaf to 'flower' as it bakes.\n| Place it on a [[baking stone]] or a baking tray\n| [[Bake]] for about 12 minutes, then turn the [[Oven|oven]] down to 200\u00b0 C (400\u00b0 F - gas 6) and bake for a further 15-20 minutes, until the base of the [[Bread|bread]] sounds hollow when you tap it.\n| Allow to cool on a raised grid.\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe with [[Butter|butter]] and [[Cheese|cheese]].  It is best eaten on the day of baking as it does not keep as well as [[Yeast|yeast]]-[[Leavened|leavened]] [[Bread|bread]].\n===Variations===\nUse [[spelt flour]] for a wholemeal-type loaf which is also easier to digest than normal wholemeal flour.\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Bread and baking]]\n[[Category:Irish recipes]]\n[[Category:Historic recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes]][[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#sodabread #bread #buttermilk #flour #bakingstone #speltflour #bakingsoda #bicarbonateofsoda #dough #yoghurt #yeast </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"

Give it a stir halfway through.\n| If after this cooking it's still very runny, reduce it further by heating on the hob.\n| Mix in half of the [[Cheese|cheese]], taste and adjust the seasoning if required.\n}}\n'''Baking the pie'''\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Grease a [[Pie dish|pie dish]] with [[Olive oil|olive oil]] and tip in the filling\n| Sprinkle over the with the remaining [[Cheddar cheese]]\n| With a sharp knife, have some fun scoring a pattern in the top, and then [[Brush|brush]] with the beaten [[Egg|egg]]\n| Lay the crust over the dish, allowing plenty of it to hang over the side as it will shrink.  Notice the difference in the photos\n| If the filling is hot then the pie will only need baking to rise the crust, whereas if it is cold, it will need longer to heat the filling\n| I would bake for 20 to 30 minutes to rise the crust alone, but check it's progress regularly\n| If you need to heat the contents as well bake for 30 to 40 minutes, but I would cover the pastry with [[tin-foil]] once it is golden-brown or it will burn.\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe hot with [[Garden peas|garden peas]], [[Boiled potatoes|boiled potatoes]] and a pint of [[Guinness]]!\n===Variations===\nMake smaller, individual pies.\n\nTo make a conventional [[steak and ale pie]], substitute [[bitter]] for the [[Guinness]].\n===Chef's tip===\nI have just lidded the pie with puff pastry but you can line the pie with [[Puff pastry|puff pastry]] as well, however, I find it just goes soggy.
