At the time and throughout the medieval period, Waterford was a powerful trading city; leather, [[wheat]], [[flour]], [[butter]] and other agricultural produce from the area around Waterford were shipped to and from England and the continent mainly to Spain, France and Italy. During the civil war records were destroyed, therefore, oral history dictates that in 1685, a large section of French Protestants were exiled to whatever countries gave them shelter, including England and Ireland. Waterford became a point of attraction to French refugees due to its ease of access; it placed them within convenient distance of their own shores, should circumstances make their return desirable; and it afforded a port of trade capable of developing the mercantile abilities of the most enterprising.  According to the oral tradition of the period, the Huguenots introduced a bread product made from left over pieces of dough in the late 17th century. Waterford bakers believe that when the Huguenots introduced the \u2018Waterford Blaa\u2019, it was called \u2018blaad\u2019 or \u2018blanc\u2019, and as the product gained in popularity, the Huguenot bakers began making dough specifically for its manufacture. The \u2018blaad\u2019 or \u2018blanc\u2019 was later corrupted to \u2018Blaa\u2019, a name which exists to the present day. \n\nDuring the early 19th century, it gained popularity, chiefly among the poor, when the founder of the Christian Brothers, brother Edmund Ignatius Rice (1762-1844) began baking the \u2018Waterford Blaa\u2019 at his own bakery in Mount Sion in Waterford City, in 1802. The simplicity of the basic ingredients made it cheap and popular with the local population. The skills required to produce it are specialised and have been passed on from the Huguenots. The tough dough requires a lot of handling, is hand floured at least three times during the various stages of production and the final product before baking is flattened by hand; this ensures that the product cannot be produced solely by machine and that the texture and flavour of the product is consistent.\n\nUnlike other products in this category, \u2018Waterford Blaa\u2019 contains no preservatives or enrichment and is made solely from preservative-free strong bakers\u2019 [[flour]], table [[salt]], compressed [[yeast]], dough conditioner and water. The addition of [[flour]] gives the product the white finish on top which results in the rough cracked appearance of the \u2018Waterford Blaa\u2019, which is a characteristic of the product. As they are not baked with steam, the heavy dusting of [[flour]] is both for protection from oven heat and to enhance the appearance. Throughout the production process of there is excessive use of [[flour]], at pinning, resting, etc. There can also be [[flour]] on the base. They are characteristically not uniform in shape and size. The dough that is used to make it is tougher and does not contain as much water as other products. It is baked for longer, producing a stronger crust which contains the distinctive [[malt]] flavour. The flattening by hand process that the producers undertake ensures the irregular shape and distinctive features. It is a popular breakfast product usually baked during the night and sold as a [[bread]] product normally eaten with [[butter]] or as a mid-day snack to make sandwiches with a variety of fillings, including [[fried]] [[potatoes]], dillsk, Irish fillet [[steak]] and relish. However, it is a popular belief that \u2018Waterford Blaa\u2019 is best when torn apart by hand and eaten fresh, straight from the bakery.\n\nReference [http://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/quality/door/registeredName.html?denominationId=5663 The European Commission]\n\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 500g [[Strong white flour|strong white flour]], plus extra for dusting\n| 10g [[Salt|salt]]\n| 20g fresh [[Yeast|yeast]] or 2 teaspoons [[Dried active yeast|dried active yeast]].\n| 10g [[Sugar|sugar]]\n| 275g lukewarm water\n\n}}\n\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n* Preheat the [[Oven|oven]] to 220\u00b0 C (425\u00b0 F - gas 7)\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| [[Sieve]] the dry ingredients.\n| Dissolve [[Yeast|yeast]] and [[Sugar|sugar]] into water and leave for 10 minutes in a [[warm place]] to activate. \n| Add wet to dry ingredients, mix until combined.\n| Knead until [[Dough|dough]] is smooth and elastic.\n| Prove for 45 minutes in a [[warm place]], covered with a damp cloth.\n| [[Knock back]].\n| Rest for 15mins.
