In which case, just use 100g of [[Grated|grated]] [[Cheddar|cheddar]].\n\nI've used a [[Food processor|food processor]] to thinly slice the [[Leeks|leeks]] and [[Potatoes|potatoes]], but they could just as easily be sliced by [[Hand|hand]].\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| 2 large potatoes, peeled and thinly sliced - I've used [[Media:Cara potatoes.jpg|Cara potatoes]]\n| 1 large [[Leek|leek]], cleaned, trimmed and thinly sliced.\n| 2 [[Cloves of Garlic, peeled and crushed|cloves of garlic, peeled and crushed]]\n| 1 heaped teaspoon of [[Taste Sensation Cajun Seasoning|taste sensation cajun seasoning]]\n| 1 teaspoon [[Dried|dried]] [[Parsley|parsley]]\n| 3 tablespoons [[Taste Sensation Matured Blue Cheese powder]]\n| 2 tablespoons [[Olive oil|olive oil]]\n| 2 tablespoons [[Plain flour|plain flour]]\n| 400 ml [[Milk|milk]]\n| 30 g [[Cheddar cheese|cheddar cheese]] [[Grated|grated]]\n| 100g cubed [[Pancetta|pancetta]] (basically [[Bacon|bacon]]!)\n}}\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Leek and potato pie ready to bake.jpg|Ready to bake\nImage:Leek and potato pie baked.jpg|The bake, baked!\n</gallery>\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| Rinse the [[Potato|potato]] slices in cold water to remove excess [[Starch|starch]]\n| [[Boil]] the [[Potato|potato]] slices in lots of water for about 7 minuets.  Leave a little bite in the [[Potatoes|potatoes]] so they keep their shape.\n| Pop the sliced [[Leeks|leeks]] in a bowl and sprinkle with the [[Cajun Seasoning|cajun seasoning]] [[Crushed garlic|crushed garlic]] and mix well.\n| Mix the [[Cheese powder|cheese powder]] into the [[Milk|milk]] and add the [[Dried|dried]] [[Parsley|parsley]]\n| Heat the [[Oil|oil]] and once it's hot, stir in the [[Flour|flour]] to make a [[Roux|roux]] (paste).\n| Gently [[Whisk|whisk]] the [[Milk|milk]] and [[Cheese powder|cheese powder]] into the four and [[Oil|oil]] until they are combined.  If using [[Grated|grated]] [[Cheese|cheese]], make the [[White sauce|white sauce]] with milk alone and then add the grated cheese.\n| Heat the [[Milk|milk]] until it is [[Simmering|simmering]] and mix well while it thickens.\n| I made my [[Cheese sauce|cheese sauce]] in a Le Cruset [[Baking|baking]] dish, but you could make in a pan and pour it into the baking dish afterwards.\n| Add the [[Leek|leek]] mixture and sliced [[Potatoes|potatoes]] in layers, pressing down to ensure even covering with the [[Cheese sauce|cheese sauce]].\n| Top with the [[Pancetta|pancetta]] cubes and a little [[Grated|grated]] [[Cheese|cheese]].\n| [[Bake]] for 1 hour, covered for the first 30 minutes, remove the cover for the final 30 minutes so the [[Pancetta|pancetta]] crisps.\n}}\n===Variations===\nJust omit the [[Bacon|bacon]] for a [[Vegetarian|vegetarian]] option.\n===Chef's notes===\nIf you don't have [[Cheese powder|cheese powder]], just use 100g of [[Grated|grated]] [[Cheddar cheese|cheddar cheese]].\nIf you don't have [[Taste Sensation Cajun Seasoning|taste sensation cajun seasoning]], half a teaspoon of [[Chilli powder|chilli powder]] and a pinch of [[Black pepper|black pepper]] would add a little bite if you don't have the [[Cajun Seasoning|cajun seasoning]].\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Irish recipes]]\n[[Category:Spicy recipes]]\n[[Category:Cheese recipes]]\n[[Category:Potato recipes]]\n[[Category:Pies tarts and flans]]\n[[Category:Taste Sensation recipes]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n[[Category:Boiled or simmered]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:12032020'>#grated #cheesepowder #pancetta #potatoes #bacon #cheddarcheese #potato #cheesesauce #parsley #leeks #cajunseasoning</code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
