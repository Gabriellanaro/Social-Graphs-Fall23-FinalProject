However, I decided to make an effort to become fond of the blighters by doing something a little different with them.  Here is the result, which is based on an [[Italian]] influenced Nigel Slater recipe in his book ''Tender: Volume I, A cook and his vegetable patch'' (ISBN 0007248490).  I will certainly make this little dish again.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 2 large [[Aubergines|aubergines]], thickly sliced, but NOT peeled\n| [[Olive oil]]\n| [[Sea Salt|sea salt]]\n| [[Black pepper]], freshly [[Ground|ground]]\n| 1-2 bulbs [[Garlic, crushed|garlic, crushed]] or finely chopped\n| 2 or more hot [[Red chillies|red chillies]], finely chopped\n| 500 g [[Tomatoes|tomatoes]], chopped\n| [[Parmesan cheese]], to taste, finely [[Grated|grated]]\n\n}}\n\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n* Preheat the [[Oven|oven]] to 220\u00b0 C (425\u00b0 F - gas 7), placing a shelf at the top of the oven.\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Place the [[Aubergine|aubergine]] slices on a [[baking tray]] so that they do not overlap - use more than one try if necessary.\n| [[Brush]] the slices with plenty of [[Olive oil|olive oil]] and lightly sprinkle the [[Salt|salt]] and [[Pepper|pepper]] over them.\n| Turn them over and do the same to the other sides.\n| [[Bake]] at the top of the [[Oven|oven]] for about 25 minutes.\n| Meanwhile, heat a little [[Oil|oil]] in a pan, add the [[Garlic|garlic]] and [[Chillies|chillies]] and quickly [[Fry|fry]], without them turning [[Brown|brown]].\n| Add the [[Tomatoes|tomatoes]] and cook until any liquid has almost evaporated and you have a thick sludge of [[Tomato|tomato]] mixture.\n| When the [[Aubergines|aubergines]] are ready spread the [[Tomato|tomato]] mixture over each slice.\n| Finally, sprinkle the [[Parmesan]] over each slice and [[Bake|bake]] for a further 10 minutes or until the [[Cheese|cheese]] has cooked.\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe with [[Ciabatta|ciabatta]].\n===Chef's notes===\nIf you find that the skins of the [[Aubergines|aubergines]] are tough, just remove the skins as you eat the slices.  Do not peel them before cooking or the slices will lose their shape and become mushy.\n\nYou may find that you need more or less of the given [[Tomato|tomato]] quantity as it will depend on how juicy the [[Tomatoes|tomatoes]] are.  If they are fairly solid, you can use less.\n\nThe amount of [[Parmesan]] you use is up to you.  Just grate a reasonable quantity of it and see how much you can [[Pile|pile]] onto the [[Aubergine|aubergine]] slices.  Any left over [[Cheese|cheese]] can be kept in the [[Fridge|fridge]] in an airtight container.\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes|Aubergines with tomatoes and parmesan]]\n[[Category:Accompaniments|Aubergines with tomatoes and parmesan]]\n[[Category:Cheese recipes|Aubergines with tomatoes and parmesan]]\n[[Category:Chilli pepper recipes|Aubergines with tomatoes and parmesan]]\n[[Category:Garlic recipes|Aubergines with tomatoes and parmesan]]\n[[Category:Italian recipes|Aubergines with tomatoes and parmesan]]\n[[Category:Snacks and light bites|Aubergines with tomatoes and parmesan]]\n[[Category:Spicy recipes|Aubergines with tomatoes and parmesan]]\n[[Category:Starters|Aubergines with tomatoes and parmesan]]\n[[Category:Vegetable recipes|Aubergines with tomatoes and parmesan]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes|Aubergines with tomatoes and parmesan]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted|Aubergines with tomatoes and parmesan]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n{{Template:PottersDontEat}}\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#aubergines #tomatoes #bakedaubergineswithtomatoesandparmesan #tomato #cheese #aubergine #parmesan #bake #oliveoil #miseenplace #blackpepper </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
