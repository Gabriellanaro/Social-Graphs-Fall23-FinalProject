After baking, even when covered with tin foil, it was quite dry.  I would also bake it in a smaller, deeper dish, so moisture is retained.  Very nice meal anyway and we will definitely be having this again.\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Italian recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes]]\n[[Category:Cheese recipes]]\n[[Category:Egg recipes]]\n[[Category:Garlic recipes]]\n[[Category:Pasta recipes]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n[[Category:Pan fried]]\n[[Category:Taste Sensation recipes]]\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:12032020'>#pasta #mushrooms #butter #egg #walnut #parsley #sauce #mozzarella #bake #doublecream #stilton</code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
