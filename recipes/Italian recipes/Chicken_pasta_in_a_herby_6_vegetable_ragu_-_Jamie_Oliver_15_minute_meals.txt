Keeping it fairly close to his original, the only differences being that I'll use [[Tagliatelle|tagliatelle]], rather than wholewheat [[Fusilli|fusilli]] as I find fusilli quite a 'heavy' [[Pasta|pasta]], and the wholewheat version even more so.  I'll use my [[Home smoked bacon|home smoked bacon]] and some nice mature Mah\u00f3n-Menorca [[Cheese|cheese]] instead of [[Parmesan|parmesan]].\n\nI think you would be pushed to prep this meal in 15 minutes, let alone prep and cook.  Anyway, a brilliant meal and well worth making.  I've used 3 chicken breasts and this will stretch to 6 servings if your not too greedy.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n}}\n'''[[Pasta sauce|pasta sauce]]'''\n{{RecipeIngredientsNB\n| 1 [[Carrot|carrot]], trimmed and peeled - sorry Jamie, I have a little more time than you did!\n| 1 [[Leek|leek]], rinsed and trimmed\n| 1 [[Courgette|courgette]], topped and tailed\n| 1 red [[Sweet Pepper|sweet pepper]], deseeded\n| 2 tablespoons [[Olive oil|olive oil]]\n| [[Sea Salt|sea salt]] and [[Freshly ground black pepper|freshly ground black pepper]]\n| 4 sprigs of freshly picked [[Thyme|thyme]]\n| 500 g [[Passata|passata]]\n}}\n'''[[Pasta|pasta]]'''\n{{RecipeIngredientsNB\n| 320 g [[Tagliatelle|tagliatelle]], smashed into small pieces so they don't remain as 'nests' \n| 2 [[Chicken breasts|chicken breasts]], skin removed\n| 4 rashers of [[Home smoked bacon|home smoked bacon]] or [[Pancetta|pancetta]]\n| 1 [[Green Indian chilli|green indian chilli]] [[Pepper|pepper]] (or to taste)\n| 4 [[Cloves of Garlic, peeled and crushed|cloves of garlic, peeled and crushed]]\n| 1 large [[Sprig of rosemary|sprig of rosemary]]\n| 2 freshly picked [[Bay leaves|bay leaves]]\n| 1 tablespoon [[Pine nuts|pine nuts]]\n| [[Balsamic vinegar]]\n}}\n'''to serve'''\n{{RecipeIngredientsNB\n| 35 g Freshly [[Grated|grated]] Mah\u00f3n-Menorca [[Cheese|cheese]]\n| Finely chopped fresh [[parsley]]\n}}\n\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Jamie Oliver herby 6 vegetable ragu in passata.jpg|The [[rag\u00f9]], Vegetables cooked, passata added\nImage:Jamie Oliver herby 6 vegetable ragu chopped.jpg|Chopped vegetables ready to sweat down\nImage:Jamie Oliver herby 6 vegetable ragu ingredients.jpg|The vegetables, sliced lengthwise, ready for shredding\n</gallery>\n===Method===\n'''[[Pasta sauce|pasta sauce]]'''\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Quarter the [[Leek|leek]] lengthwise, keeping the past part uncut in order to feed through the [[Food processor|food processor]] easily\n| Slice the [[Celery|celery]] into four, lengthwise, leaving the leafy end uncut for the same reason\n| Peel, top and tail the [[Carrot|carrot]] and slice into 4 lengthwise, ditto with the [[Courgette|courgette]]\n| Cut the [[Pepper|pepper]] into strips\n| Feed all of the [[Vegetables|vegetables]] through a [[Food processor|food processor]] with a thin slicing cutter so they are all finely chopped, feed them through a second time if need be\n| Add the [[Olive oil|olive oil]] and a grind of [[Black pepper|black pepper]] to an [[Iron|iron]] [[Casserole dish|casserole dish]] and heat over the [[Hob|hob]]\n| Add the [[Thyme leaves|thyme leaves]] picked from the sprig and the [[Vegetables|vegetables]] and pan-[[Fry|fry]] for 10 minutes stirring regularly\n| After the [[Vegetables|vegetables]] have been cooked, stir in the [[Passata|passata]] and [[Simmer|simmer]] gently\n}}\n'''[[Pasta|pasta]]'''\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Meanwhile cook the [[Pasta|pasta]] in [[Boiling|boiling]] [[Salted|salted]] water for about 6 minutes or  according to the packet instructions\n| Hammer the [[Chicken breasts|chicken breasts]] flat and cut into a 2 cm [[Dice|dice]]\n| Heat a tablespoon of [[Olive oil|olive oil]] and a grind of [[Black pepper|black pepper]] and the [[Sprig of rosemary|sprig of rosemary]] and the [[Bay leaves|bay leaves]] in a separate pan or [[Wok|wok]] and [[Stir-fry|stir-fry]] the [[Chicken|chicken]] until golden and properly cooked\n| Cut the [[Bacon|bacon]] into fine slices, crush the [[Garlic|garlic]] and finely chop the [[Chilli|chilli]]\n| Add these to the [[Chicken|chicken]] and [[Stir fry|stir fry]] with the [[Pine nuts|pine nuts]] until the [[Bacon|bacon]] is [[Browned|browned]]\n| Drain the [[Pasta|pasta]], reserving a little of the cooking [[Liquor|liquor]] to loosen the finished dish\n| Mix the [[Pasta|pasta]] and the [[Sauce|sauce]], adding a little of the [[Liquor|liquor]] to loosen it if needed\n| Scatter the [[Chicken|chicken]] and [[Bacon|bacon]] over the [[Pasta|pasta]] and garnish with finely grated [[Mah\u00f3n-Menorca cheese]] and a little chopped [[parsley]]\n| Serve!\n}}\n===Recipe source===\n\n* Based on a recipe seen on Jamie Oliver's 15 minute meals, but made more leisurely!\n\n{{Template:YoutubePastaDough}}\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Italian recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:Pasta recipes]]\n[[Category:Poultry recipes]]\n[[Category:Pan fried]]\n[[Category:Boiled or simmered]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#pasta #bacon #chicken #vegetables #oliveoil #chickenbreasts #carrot #cheese #pastasauce #leek #blackpepper </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
