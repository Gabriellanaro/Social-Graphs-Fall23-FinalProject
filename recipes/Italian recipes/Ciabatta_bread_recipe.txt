The [[Dough|dough]] for this loaf is quite wet, hence the 'collapsed' shape.\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n}}\n====for the starter====\n{{RecipeIngredientsNB\n| &#189; teaspoon [[Dried yeast|dried yeast]]\n| 150 ml tepid water\n| 3 tablespoons tepid [[Milk|milk]]\n| &#189; teaspoon [[Honey|honey]]\n| 150g [[Strong white flour|strong white flour]]\n}}\n====for the dough====\n{{RecipeIngredientsNB\n| &#189; teaspoon [[Dried yeast|dried yeast]]\n| 350g [[Strong white flour|strong white flour]] \n| &#189; teaspoon [[Olive oil|olive oil]]\n| 200 ml water\n| 1.5 teaspoons fine [[Sea Salt|sea salt]]\n}}\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n\n* Make the [[Starter|starter]] first, bear in mind it will need to [[Rest|rest]] overnight in a [[Warm place|warm place]].\n\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n}}\n====Starter====\n{{RecipeMethod\n| In a very large bowl, sprinkle the [[Yeast|yeast]] into 150 ml of water mixed with 3 tablespoons of [[Milk|milk]].\n| Leave for 10 minutes then stir in the [[Honey|honey]]\n| Mix in 150 g of [[Strong white flour|strong white flour]] to make a fairly loose [[Batter|batter]]\n| Cover with a damp [[Tea-towel|tea-towel]] and leave in a [[Warm place|warm place]] for 12 hours\n}}\n====Dough====\n{{RecipeMethod\n| In a small bowl sprinkle &#189; teaspoon of [[Dried yeast|dried yeast]] into 240 ml of tepid water,  together with &#189; teaspoon of [[Olive oil|olive oil]]. Give it a quick stir then leave for 10 minutes to dissolve\n| Add this mixture to the large bowl together with 350 g of [[Strong white flour|strong white flour]] and 1.5 teaspoons of fine [[Sea Salt|sea salt]]\n| Using a wooden spoon, beat this mixture for at least 5 minutes until fully combined\n| Use a silicone [[Spatula|spatula]] to collect the [[Dough|dough]] residue from the edge of the bowl, cover with a damp cloth and leave for 3 hours in a [[Warm place|warm place]] until doubled or trebled in size\n}}\n====Proving====\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Be very gentle at this stage as we don't to ''knock the [[Dough|dough]] down\n| Generously [[Flour|flour]] 2 [[Baking|baking]] sheets and have a small bowl with extra flour for your hands\n| Using a [[Dough|dough]] scraper divide the dough in two.  My dough was slightly too wet so it was easier to pour the dough onto the floured sheet.\n| Using well floured hands, shape the loaf by tucking the sides under themselves until you have the classic flat elongated shape.\n| Repeat with the second loaf\n| Preheat your [[Oven|oven]] to 220\u00b0 C (425\u00b0 F - gas 7), [fan oven 200\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]\n| Leave the loaves to [[Prove|prove]] for 30 minutes, during which time they will spread out more\n| [[Bake]] to 30 minutes in the middle of the pre-heated [[Oven|oven]].\n| Allow to cool on a wire rack.\n}}\n\n===Variations===\nIf using fresh [[Yeast|yeast]], use 2.5 g of fresh yeast for the [[Starter|starter]] and 2.5 g of fresh yeast for the [[Dough|dough]]\n==See also==\n\n* [[Ciabatta]]\n* [[Ciabatta with biga]]\n* [[Ciabatta_bread_(breadmaker_recipe)]]\n* [[Parmesan ciabatta]]\n==Chef's notes==\n'''Using a breadmaker:'''\nKneading this mixture with a wooden spoon was hard work to say the least.  The second time I made these, I transferred the dough mixture to our [[Panasonic SD-ZB2502 automatic breadmaker]] for the kneading process.  I set it to pitta bread (22) and let it run for 10 minutes, then switched it off and left for 3 hours to rise.  It was easy to ''pour'' the dough onto the baking sheets, using a knife to cut the dough.\n\n{{Template:Ciabatta bread recipes}}\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Italian recipes]]\n[[Category:Bread and baking]]\n[[Category:Snacks and light bites]]\n[[Category:Vegan recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#dough #ciabattabreadrecipe #strongwhiteflour #yeast #driedyeast #warmplace #oliveoil #ciabatta #honey #starter #rest </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
