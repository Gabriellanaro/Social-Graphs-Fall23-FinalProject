This ensures the ravioli is nicely cooked, otherwise it can be too al dente for my liking.  It does also mean that you can cook the ravioli a little ahead of time and just reheat in the soup.\n| Slide the ravioli into a pan of fast boiling salted water, bring it back to the boil and cook for 5 minutes.  A [[wok]] is ideal as it allows you to maneuver the pasta to ensure it's evenly cooked, without breaking it up.\n| Add the [[Lobster bisque|lobster bisque]] to another pan and gently bring to a [[Simmer|simmer]]\n| Carefully slide the [[Ravioli|ravioli]] into the [[Simmering|simmering]] [[Soup|soup]] and heat for 4 minutes\n| it is important that you jiggle the pan every now and then to prevent the [[Ravioli|ravioli]] from sticking to the base of the pan\n}}\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Home_made_crab_ravioli.jpg|300px|thumb|right|Rustic home made crab ravioli\nImage:Cutting ravioli.jpg|300px|thumb|right|A [[pizza cutter]] and a fork does better job than a specialised [[ravioli cutter]]\n</gallery>\n===Serving suggestions===\nFor  hint of luxury, drizzle a few tablespoons of [[single cream]] just before serving and serve with a [[Green leaf salad|green leaf salad]] of [[Rocket|rocket]] and [[Tomatoes|tomatoes]]\n\n{{Template:YoutubePastaDough}}\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Italian recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Soup and stock recipes]]\n[[Category:Starters]]\n[[Category:Tapas, mezze and antipasti]]\n[[Category:Fish recipes]]\n[[Category:Pasta recipes]]\n[[Category:Sea fish recipes]]\n[[Category:Shellfish recipes]]\n[[Category:Boiled or simmered]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#ravioli #pasta #crabravioli #lobsterbisque #crabmeat #singlecream #raviolicutter #crab #pizzacutter #juice #freshpasta </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
