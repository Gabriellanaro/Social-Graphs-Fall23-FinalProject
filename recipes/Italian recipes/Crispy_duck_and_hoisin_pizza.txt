A couple of cooked [[Duck|duck]] breasts would work just as well on this [[Pizza|pizza]].\n\nI [[Vacuum packed|vacuum packed]] the half [[Duck|duck]] in 2 tablespoons of [[Peking duck|peking duck]] [[Sauce]] ([[Hoisin sauce]] is very similar) and cooked [[Sous vide|sous vide]] for 8 hours at 60\u00b0C and [[Shredded|shredded]] it ready for the [[Pizza topping|pizza topping]].  The duck would be perfectly cooked after 3 hours at 57\u00b0C, but I wanted to achieve the 'overcooked and falling apart' finish that you can't get with cooking for shorter times.  As it is vacuum sealed, it stays nice and moist and the quick heat from the grill give the duck a nice crispy finish.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| 1 portion [[Pizza dough|pizza dough]] - Makes 2 [[Pizzas|pizzas]]\n| 150g of selected [[Cheeses|cheeses]], [[Grated|grated]].\n| 4 tablespoons of [[Tomato sauce for pizza]]\n| 4 medium [[Tomatoes|tomatoes]], sliced\n| 300 g  peking crispy [[Duck|duck]], [[Shredded|shredded]]\n| A large bunch of fresh [[Chives|chives]], chopped\n| [[Olive oil]]\n}}\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n\n* Preheat the [[Grill|grill]] (if using a [[Pizza stone|pizza stone]])\n* If using the [[Oven|oven]], preheat it to 220\u00b0 C (425\u00b0 F - gas 7)\n\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| Dust your work surface with [[Fine yellow cornmeal|fine yellow cornmeal]]\n| Divide the [[Pizza dough|pizza dough]] into two and roll out into two thin 25.5 cm (10 inch) [[Pizzas|pizzas]]\n| You can leave them in a [[Warm place|warm place]] for an hour or so to rise.

Don't put the cheese on top of the duck if you want it to be crispy.\n| Season with [[Salt|salt]], [[Pepper|pepper]] and finish with a drizzle of [[Olive oil|olive oil]].\n| Return to the [[Oven|oven]] and [[Bake|bake]] until the [[Cheese|cheese]] is nicely melted. This should take about 4 minutes under a [[Grill|grill]] on a [[Pizza stone|pizza stone]], if oven [[Baking|baking]], about 15 minutes in the middle of the oven.\n| Repeat for the second [[Pizza|pizza]].\n| Keep the first [[Pizza|pizza]] warm at the bottom of the [[Oven|oven]] whilst you make the second.\n| Sprinkle with chopped chives and serve\n}}\n===See also===\n*[[Sous vide duck pizza]]\n*[[Sous vide hoisin duck pizza]]\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Chinese recipes]]\n[[Category:Italian recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Cheese recipes]]\n[[Category:Chilli pepper recipes]]\n[[Category:Pizza recipes]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n[[Category:Grilled, griddled or barbecued]]\n[[Category:Sous vide cooking]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#pizza #duck #pizzastone #crispyduckandhoisinpizza #grill #oliveoil #pizzas #pizzadough #shredded #bake #provolone </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
