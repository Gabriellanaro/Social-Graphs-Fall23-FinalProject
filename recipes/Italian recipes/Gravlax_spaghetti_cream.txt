I came up with this recipe as I thought the flavours and textures went well together.  They do!  This unlikely mixture of [[Italian]] and [[Scandinavian]] ingredients is going to be one of my stock recipes.\n\nIkea sell gravlax in the food section or you can [[Gravlax|make it yourself]] if you plan far enough ahead.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 200 g [[Dried spaghetti|dried spaghetti]]\n| 160 g very thinly sliced [[Gravlax|gravlax]]\n| 100 g [[Cream cheese|cream cheese]]\n| 300 g [[Sour cream|sour cream]]\n| 125 ml [[White wine|white wine]] or [[Sherry|sherry]]\n| [[Louisiana Hot Pepper Sauce|Louisiana hot pepper sauce]] or [[Tabasco sauce]] - A few drops, not lots.
