[[Duck|duck]] is a great candidate for this as I find sometimes if it's cooked rare, it can be a bit chewy.  This has been [[Sous vide|sous vide]]  cooked for 3 hours at 56.5\u00b0C (''133.7\u00b0F'').  [[Seared]], skin side only to release excess [[Fat|fat]] and then allowed to cool and then sliced thinly and added to the [[Pizza|pizza]]. It was a lot of work but it was delicious. \n\nOne 170g [[Duck|duck]] breast was enough for two [[Pizzas|pizzas]], I [[Sous vide|sous vide]] cooked two and froze the unused one for next weeks duck [[Pizza|pizza]].\n\nI added a teaspoon of [[Hoisin sauce|hoisin sauce]] to the vacuum bag as I think it goes so well with [[Duck|duck]].  That's a personal taste so I guess it is optional.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| 170g [[Duck|duck]] breast, skin on.\n| 1 teaspoon [[Hoisin sauce|hoisin sauce]]\n| 1 portion [[Pizza dough|pizza dough]]\n| 4 tablespoons of [[Tomato sauce for pizza|tomato sauce for pizzas]]\n| 250g [[Mozzarella cheese|mozzarella cheese]]\n| [[Sea Salt|sea salt]] and [[Freshly ground black pepper|freshly ground black pepper]]\n| A pinch of [[Dried oregano|dried oregano]]\n| A drizzle of [[Olive oil|olive oil]]\n}}\n\n===[[Mise en place]]===\nIf using a pizza stone, preheat the pizza stone under a very hot grill for about 20 minutes. Place it about 8cm (3\") from the heat source.\n\nIf using the oven, preheat it to 220\u00b0 C (425\u00b0 F - gas 7)\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Sous vide duck pizza.jpg|Fresh out of the oven\nImage:Sous vide duck pizza tomato topping.jpg|Spreading out the topping\nImage:Sous vide duck pizza ready for the oven.jpg|Ready for the oven\nImage:Sous vide duck pizza one breast.jpg|One breast, two pizzas\nImage:Sous vide duck pizza seared.jpg|Duck breast seared\n</gallery>\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| [[Vacuum seal]] the [[Duck|duck]] breast together with 1 teaspoon of [[Hoisin sauce|hoisin sauce]]\n| Cook in a [[Sous vide bath|sous vide bath]] for 3 hours at 56.5\u00b0C\n| Remove from the vacuum bag, discarding the [[Sauce|sauce]], it will have done its job and flavoured the [[Meat|meat]].\n| Allow to [[Rest for|rest for]] 10 minutes.\n| Heat a [[Frying pan|frying pan]] over a medium high flame\n| Wipe any [[Sauce|sauce]] from the skin side of the [[Duck|duck]] breast and [[Sear|sear]] (skin side only) in the hot pan for 3 minutes without adding any extra [[Oil|oil]].\n| Allow to cool and slice thinly.  This can all be done way ahead of cooking the [[Pizza|pizza]].\n| Dust your work surface with [[Fine yellow cornmeal|fine yellow cornmeal]]\n| Divide the [[Pizza dough|pizza dough]] into two and roll out into two thin 25.5 cm (10 inch) [[Pizzas|pizzas]]\n| You can leave them in a [[Warm place|warm place]] for an hour or so to rise. I quite like them cooked immediately they are rolled out for a more crispy finish.\n| Prick the [[Pizza|pizza]] all over with a fork. This prevents it puffing up too much and burning while it is cooking\n| With a deft move, slide the [[Pizza|pizza]] from the [[Pizza peel|pizza peel]], on to the preheated [[Pizza stone|pizza stone]].\n| Cook on one side only for about 2 minutes or until lightly [[Browned|browned]].\n| Repeat for the other side.\n| Remove from the [[Oven|oven]] and spread the pizza with 2 tablespoons of [[Tomato sauce for pizza|tomato sauce for pizza]].\n| Crumble a ball of [[mozzarella]] cheese over the pizza and top with the sliced duck.\n| Season with salt, pepper a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of oregano.\n| Return to the [[Oven|oven]] and bake until the [[Cheese|cheese]] is nicely melted. This should take about 4 minutes under a grill on a pizza stone, if oven baking, about 15 minutes in the middle of the oven.\n| Repeat for the second [[Pizza|pizza]].\n| Keep the first [[Pizza|pizza]] warm at the bottom of the [[Oven|oven]] whilst you make the second.\n}}\n===See also===\n* [[Sous vide hoisin duck pizza]]\n* [[Crispy duck and hoisin pizza]]\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Italian recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Snacks and light bites]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:Poultry recipes]]\n[[Category:Pizza recipes]]\n[[Category:Sous vide recipes]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n[[Category:Sous vide cooking]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#pizza #sousvideduckpizza #duck #hoisinsauce #pizzas #pizzadough #sauce #sousvide #mozzarella #cheese #oliveoil </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
