[[Spam]] cooks up really well when grilled at a very high heat so is ideal for a [[Stone baked pizza]].\n\nIf you really don't like the idea of using [[Spam]], use fresh [[ham]] instead.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 1 portion [[Pizza dough|pizza dough]] - Makes 2 pizzas\n| 150 g ball of [[Mozzarella cheese|mozzarella cheese]], torn into pieces\n| 1 340 g can of [[Spam]] original (chopped pork and ham), cut into thin strips.\n| [[Extra virgin olive oil]] for drizzling\n| 1 cup [[Spicy tomato sauce|spicy tomato sauce]]\n| Handful of [[Basil leaves|basil leaves]], torn\n| 1 tablespoon [[Fine yellow cornmeal|cornmeal]]\n\n}}\n\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n* Make the [[Pizza dough|pizza dough]] as instructed\n* If using a [[pizza stone]], preheat the [[pizza stone]] under a very hot [[grill]] for about 20 minutes.  Place it about 8cm (3\") from the heat source.\n\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Make 1 pizza per person\n| Dust the work surface with [[Fine yellow cornmeal|fine yellow cornmeal]]\n| Stretch or roll the [[Dough|dough]] into two thin rounds\n| Prick the pizza all over with a fork. This prevents it puffing up too much and burning while it is cooking\n| Place the pizza dough on a [[pizza peel]] that has been dusted with [[Fine yellow cornmeal|fine yellow cornmeal]]\n| With a deft move, slide the pizza dough from the [[pizza peel]], on to the [[pizza stone]].\n| Cook for about 2 minutes on one side only or until lightly browned.\n| Remove from the oven, flip over and add the topping.\n| Repeat for the second pizza whilst you prepare the first.\n| Drizzle the [[Pizza|pizza]] with [[Olive oil|olive oil]] and spread the pizza with &frac12; of the [[Tomato sauce|tomato sauce]]\n| Top with torn [[Mozzarella|mozzarella]] and sliced [[Spam]].\n| Add a final drizzle of [[olive oil]] or for a spicy touch, some [[chili oil]].\n| [[Bake]] for 3 or 4  minutes or until the [[Cheese|cheese]] browns a little - watch it carefully as it can burn easily.\n| Remove and sprinkle with torn [[Basil|basil]].\n| Keep the fist pizza warm at the bottom of the oven whilst you make the second.\n| Serve hot\n}}\n===Chef's note===\nIf you don't have a [[pizza peel]] use an upturned plate or a flat baking tray, dusted with [[Fine yellow cornmeal|fine yellow cornmeal]] and some deft handwork to slide the dough onto the stone.\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Cheese recipes]]\n[[Category:Italian recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:North American recipes]]\n[[Category:Pizza recipes]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#spam #fineyellowcornmeal #pizzapeel #spampizza #pizzastone #oliveoil #pizzadough #bake #ham #pizza #cheese </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
