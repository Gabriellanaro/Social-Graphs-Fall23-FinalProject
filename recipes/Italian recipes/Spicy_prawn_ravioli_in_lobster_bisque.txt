Because the [[Ravioli|ravioli]] is cooked in the sauce, rather than water, it does not matter so much if they leak a little, which they usually do.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 10 large [[King prawns|king prawns]], shelled and de-veined (mine were [[Frozen|frozen]] and [[defrosted]])\n| Splash of [[Nam pla|nam pla]]\n| 1 tablespoon [[Ghee|ghee]]\n| 1 tablespoon [[Olive oil|olive oil]]\n| 3 [[Fat|fat]] Cloves of [[Garlic|garlic]], peeled and crushed\n| 2.5 cm [[Ginger|ginger]], peeled and finely chopped\n| Big splash of [[Louisiana Hot Pepper Sauce|Louisiana hot pepper sauce]] ([[Tabasco]] does just as well)\n| Pinch of [[Salt|salt]]\n| 1 tablespoon [[Cornflour|cornflour]] - see Chef's notes\n| Home made [[Pasta|pasta]] (100 g [[Flour|flour]], 3 [[Egg yolks|egg yolks]], pinch [[Salt|salt]], 1 teaspoon [[Dried|dried]] [[Parsley|parsley]]\n| Leave the pasta in the [[Fridge|fridge]] for a few hours before rolling out\n| Roll out into quite thick sheets, the middle setting on our [[Imperia pasta machine]])\n}}\n'''[[Sauce]]'''\n* 1 can [[Lobster|lobster]] biqsue\n* 150 ml [[Single cream|single cream]]\n* 40 ml [[dry sherry]]\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:12 Spicy prawn ravioli.jpg|12 of the best!\nImage:making spicy prawn ravioli.jpg|Wet the edges for a better join\nImage:Ginger and garlic prawns with chilli.jpg|Garlic and ginger prawns and a big splash of Louisiana hot pepper sauce\n</gallery>\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| [[Fresh pasta|Make the fresh pasta as shown here]], adding 1 tablespoon [[Dried|dried]] [[Parsley|parsley]] - fresh would be better but ours is a bit mangy this time of year.  I left the pasta in the [[Fridge|fridge]] for a good while in the hope the parsley would rehydrate a little.\n| Soak the [[Prawns|prawns]] in the [[Nam pla|nam pla]] for an hour or so.  I like to do this as it makes them even fishier.  You could omit this if you don't have the inclination!\n| Blitz the [[Prawns|prawns]] for a few seconds in a [[Food processor|food processor]] (or [[Delia's chopper]] - ordered but not yet arrived!) - The resulting mix should be [[Rice|rice]]-[[Grain|grain]] sized pieces of [[Prawn|prawn]], not pur\u00e9e.\n| Heat the [[Ghee|ghee]] and [[Olive oil|olive oil]], add the [[Garlic|garlic]] and [[Ginger|ginger]] and [[Fry|fry]] off until it just starts to colour, stir in the [[Prawn|prawn]] mixture and stir constantly so it mixes well and cooks evenly\n| When the [[Prawn|prawn]] stars to colour, remove from the heat, add a pinch of salt and the hot pepper sauce.  I added a little [[Cornflour|cornflour]] to thicken at this stage, though there may be better ways.  Allow to cool a little.\n| Roll out the [[Pasta|pasta]] using the middle setting on an [[Imperia pasta machine]] - too thin and the [[Ravioli|ravioli]] has a tendency to leak\n| Cut the [[Pasta|pasta]] into strips about 4 cm wide\n| Place just under a tablespoon of the mix on the [[Pasta|pasta]], avoid getting [[Oil|oil]] on the edges as they won't stick well\n| Wet the edges of the [[Ravioli|ravioli]] fold over, press together with your fingers, finishing with the back of a fork.\n| Place on a lightly floured plate\n| Add the [[Sherry|sherry]] to the [[Lobster bisque|lobster bisque]] and gently heat in a large pan until [[Simmering|simmering]], add the [[Ravioli|ravioli]] and [[Simmer|simmer]], covered, for another 8 minutes\n| remove from the heat, gently stir in the [[Cream|cream]] and serve immediately\n}}\n===Chef's notes===\nI used [[Cornflour|cornflour]] to thicken the [[Prawn|prawn]] mixture as there was quite a lot of liquid which I wanted to keep.  There may be better ways of doing this but cornflour worked.\n===Variations===\nIt might be nice to add a little [[Mascarpone cheese|mascarpone cheese]] to the mixture for a really rich meal!\n==See also==\n{{Template:PeelingGinger}}\n{{Template:Lobster recipes}}\n\n{{Template:YoutubePastaDough}}\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Chilli pepper recipes]]\n[[Category:Fish recipes]]\n[[Category:Garlic recipes]]\n[[Category:Italian recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Pasta recipes]]\n[[Category:Sea fish recipes]]\n[[Category:Shellfish recipes]]\n[[Category:Spicy recipes]]\n[[Category:Favourite recipes]]\n[[Category:Boiled or simmered]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#ravioli #pasta #prawn #spicyprawnravioliinlobsterbisque #cornflour #oliveoil #nampla #ginger #fridge #imperiapastamachine #prawns </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
