The new recipe was created by a special committee from the Italian [[Cookery]] Academy and was deposited as a deed with The Chamber of Commerce in [[Bologna]]. This recipe replaces the original 1892 formula for [[Ragu|ragu]] alla bolognaise.\n\nThe new recipe removes [[Cream|cream]] and cartella, which is a [[Cut of beef|cut of beef]] that is hard to find nowadays. Good quality [[Stock cubes|stock cubes]] are now allowed. \"''Today we are consigning to our grandchildren something that is immortal. And we are teaching the culture of our city through a good plate of [[Tagliatelle|tagliatelle]]''\", said Valerio Veronesi, the president of [[Bologna]]'s Chamber of Commerce. \n\nRoberto Ariani, Secretary General of the [[Italian]] [[Cookery]] Academy, explained \"''In 40 years cookery has changed. What was accepted in the past may not be appreciated by contemporary   palates. That is why we have decided to modify the rag\u00f9 recipe.''\"\n\nThe earliest documented recipe for [[Ragu|ragu]] served with [[Pasta|pasta]] dates back to Imola, near [[Bologna]] in the late 18th century. The academy experts advise [[saut\u00e9ing]] the [[Minced meat|minced meat]] separately from the [[Vegetables|vegetables]] and will allow chopped chicken livers and hearts. Smoked pancetta, [[Garlic|garlic]], and [[Herbs|herbs]] such as [[Rosemary|rosemary]] and [[Parsley|parsley]] are not allowed. [[Brandy]] and [[Flour|flour]] cannot be used for thickening the [[Sauce|sauce]].\n\nSome of the changes may offend traditionalists, and members of the academy acknowledge this. Atos Cavazza, a representative of the Academy's [[Bologna]] branch, noted: \"''This document is not intended to be the [[Sole|sole]] recipe but it is a recommendation to follow.''\"\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| 400g coarsely [[Minced beef|minced beef]]\n| 150g chopped [[Pork|pork]] [[Pancetta|pancetta]]\n| Half an [[Onion|onion]]\n| 1 [[Carrot|carrot]]\n| 12 stick of [[Celery|celery]]\n| 1 [[Glass|glass]] of [[Red or white wine|red or white wine]]\n| 200g [[Tomato puree|tomato puree]]\n| 1 tablespoon [[Tomato paste|tomato paste]]\n| 1 [[Glass|glass]] of [[Whole milk|whole milk]]\n| light [[Meat|meat]] or [[Vegetable|vegetable]] [[Broth|broth]] ([[Stock cubes|stock cubes]] permitted)\n| 3 tablespoon [[Extra virgin Olive oil|extra virgin olive oil]]\n| [[Salt]] and [[Pepper|pepper]]\n}}\n\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| Begin by placing the [[Pancetta|pancetta]] in a [[Dutch Oven|dutch oven]] that is at room temperature, and then place it over medium heat.\n| Allow the pancetta to render its [[Fat|fat]] before adding the chopped [[Celery|celery]], [[Carrots|carrots]] and [[Onion|onion]], followed by a pinch of [[Salt|salt]]. \n| Let it soften for around 5 minutes before adding the [[Ground beef|ground beef]] that has been coarsely [[Ground|ground]], and break it apart in the pan.\n| [[Brown]] the [[Meat|meat]] well for approximately 5 minutes over high heat.\n| Once the [[Meat|meat]] is [[Browned|browned]], pour in the [[Wine|wine]] and allow it to reduce until the pan is almost [[Dry|dry]].\n| Pour in the [[Broth|broth]] and [[Passata|passata]] until the meat is fully covered. Reduce the heat to low and let it [[Simmer|simmer]] uncovered for approximately an hour.\n| After an hour has passed, add the [[MILK|milk]] and continue cooking over low heat for another hour. If it looks like the mixture is getting [[Dry|dry]], add more [[Broth|broth]] or water as necessary.\n| It's important to stir every 15 minutes or so throughout the cooking process.\n| After two hours have passed, turn off the heat and serve with [[Fresh pasta|fresh pasta]] such as [[Tagliatelle|tagliatelle]] or fettuccine made with [[Eggs|eggs]].\n}}\n\n\n===Recipe source===\n* The official recipe for [[Ragu|ragu]] served with [[Pasta|pasta]] or [[Bolognaise|bolognaise]] [[Pasta sauce|pasta sauce]] as defined by the committee of the [[Italian]] [[Cookery]] Academy, 2023\n===Chef's notes===\n[[Tomato puree]] and [[Tomato paste|tomato paste]] are both made from cooked, [[Strained|strained]] [[Tomatoes|tomatoes]], but there are some differences between them.\n\n[[Tomato puree]] is a smooth and thick liquid that is made by cooking and straining fresh [[Tomatoes|tomatoes]]. It has a bright red color and a relatively thin consistency, similar to that of a thick [[Soup|soup]]. It may have some seasonings or other [[Vegetables|vegetables]] added to it, but it does not usually have any added [[Sugar|sugar]]. [[Tomato]] [[Puree|puree]] is commonly used as a base for [[Sauces|sauces]], [[Soups|soups]], [[Stews|stews]], and other dishes.\n\n[[Tomato paste]], on the other [[Hand|hand]], is a thick and concentrated paste made by cooking down [[Tomatoes|tomatoes]] for several hours to remove most of the water content. This results in a thick and dense paste that is very rich in tomato flavor. [[Tomato]] paste is darker in color than [[Tomato puree|tomato puree]] and has a much thicker consistency. It is often sold in small cans or tubes and is used to add intense tomato flavor to [[Sauces|sauces]], [[Soups|soups]], and [[Stews|stews]]. Some tomato paste brands may have added [[Sugar|sugar]] or [[Salt|salt]].\n\nIn summary, [[Tomato puree|tomato puree]] is a smooth and thin liquid made from cooked and [[Strained|strained]] fresh [[Tomatoes|tomatoes]], while [[Tomato paste|tomato paste]] is a thick and concentrated paste made by cooking down tomatoes to remove most of the water content.\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Italian recipes]]\n[[Category:Historic recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Beef recipes]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:Pasta recipes]]\n[[Category:Pork recipes]]\n[[Category:Pan fried]]\n[[Category:Stewed, braised or pot roasted]]\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:12032020'>#spaghettibolognaise #officialSpagBol #officialRagu #2023ragu #bolognapasta #tomatopaste #tomatoes #broth #cookery #italian #ragu #revampedragu</code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
