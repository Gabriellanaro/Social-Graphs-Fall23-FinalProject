However, I decided to make an effort to become fond of the blighters by doing something a little different with them.  Here is the result, which is based on an [[Italian]] influenced Nigel Slater recipe in his book ''Tender: Volume I, A cook and his vegetable patch'' (ISBN 0007248490).  I will certainly make this little dish again.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 2 large [[Aubergines|aubergines]], thickly sliced, but NOT peeled\n| [[Olive oil]]\n| [[Sea Salt|sea salt]]\n| [[Black pepper]], freshly [[Ground|ground]]\n| 1-2 bulbs [[Garlic, crushed|garlic, crushed]] or finely chopped\n| 2 or more hot [[Red chillies|red chillies]], finely chopped\n| 500 g [[Tomatoes|tomatoes]], chopped\n| [[Parmesan cheese]], to taste, finely [[Grated|grated]]\n\n}}\n\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n* Preheat the [[Oven|oven]] to 220\u00b0 C (425\u00b0 F - gas 7), placing a shelf at the top of the oven.\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Place the [[Aubergine|aubergine]] slices on a [[baking tray]] so that they do not overlap - use more than one try if necessary.\n| [[Brush]] the slices with plenty of [[Olive oil|olive oil]] and lightly sprinkle the [[Salt|salt]] and [[Pepper|pepper]] over them.\n| Turn them over and do the same to the other sides.\n| [[Bake]] at the top of the [[Oven|oven]] for about 25 minutes.\n| Meanwhile, heat a little [[Oil|oil]] in a pan, add the [[Garlic|garlic]] and [[Chillies|chillies]] and quickly [[Fry|fry]], without them turning [[Brown|brown]].\n| Add the [[Tomatoes|tomatoes]] and cook until any liquid has almost evaporated and you have a thick sludge of [[Tomato|tomato]] mixture.\n| When the [[Aubergines|aubergines]] are ready spread the [[Tomato|tomato]] mixture over each slice.\n| Finally, sprinkle the [[Parmesan]] over each slice and [[Bake|bake]] for a further 10 minutes or until the [[Cheese|cheese]] has cooked.\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe with [[Ciabatta|ciabatta]].\n===Chef's notes===\nIf you find that the skins of the [[Aubergines|aubergines]] are tough, just remove the skins as you eat the slices.  Do not peel them before cooking or the slices will lose their shape and become mushy.\n\nYou may find that you need more or less of the given [[Tomato|tomato]] quantity as it will depend on how juicy the [[Tomatoes|tomatoes]] are.  If they are fairly solid, you can use less.\n\nThe amount of [[Parmesan]] you use is up to you.  Just grate a reasonable quantity of it and see how much you can [[Pile|pile]] onto the [[Aubergine|aubergine]] slices.

Thank you Jamie.]]\n</div>\nThis is basically our tried and tested [[pasta recipe]] using the fabulous [[Taste Sensation Well Matured Cheese Powder]] to give a lovely cheesy tang.  Unlike using grated cheese, the powder mixes perfectly into the pasta dough.\n\nIt's easier with a pasta machine, but by no means impossible without.  Use Jamie Oliver's trick, with a [[rolling pin]], roll the pasta into a few sheets at the thickness you require, then slice into rustic strips with a knife. Simple.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 100 g [[Italian grade 'OO' flour]] or [[plain flour]]\n| 1 whole [[:Category:Egg recipes|free range egg]]\n| 1 [[:Category:Egg recipes|free range egg yolk]]\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Add all of the [[flour]] and 2 tablespoons of [[Mature cheese powder]] into a [[food processor]] and give it a whizz\n| Add the whole [[egg]] and the [[yolk]] and blitz it until it resembles rice grains, about 2 minutes or so\n| If it turns floury add a tiny drop of water\n| Likewise, if it stays as wet [[dough]], add a little more [[flour]]\n| Once it's rice-like, knock out onto a lightly dusted worktop and [[Kneading bread|knead]] into a ball, place in a bowl and cover with a dampened tea-towel for an hour or so\n| Divide into 3 or 4 balls, placing unused balls back in the covered bowl\n| With a rolling pin, roughly roll out each ball so it fits into your pasta machine, and  repeatedly run through the machine, from the thickest setting, to the final thickness\n| It's useful if you can hang the pasta over a skewer until it's ready to use or it tends to stick together\n| In the biggest pan you have (10 pints water / 1 lb pasta) bring water with a pinch of [[salt]], to the boil - no oil required\n| Once on a rolling boil, add the pasta, a quick stir with a chop-stick or long spoon to prevent sticking\n| The texture you should be aiming for is [[al-dente]] - a little resistance when you bite; rabbit like! This only takes a few minutes with fresh pasta\n| Once [[al-dente]], remove, drain and serve\n}}\n===By weight: ratio of [[flour]] to [[eggs]]===\nTo calculate the exact amount of [[eggs]] to [[flour]], by weight, use 3 parts [[flour]] to 2 parts [[egg]].  To make a rich ''Royal pasta dough'', use only the egg yolks, reserving a little of the white should you need to moisten the dough a little.\n\nIf using this method, weigh the eggs first and then multiply that by 1.5 to calculate the amount of flour you will need.\n===Variations===\n\nTo make whole wheat pasta use three quarters of durum wheat flour and one quarter of chickpea flour with a little bit of water and olive oil, no eggs. \n\nWhole wheat flour and spelt flour can be used as well, always with a little bit of water and oil. Once you have done the dough, leave it in the fridge for half an hour: it will be easier to roll it out. Follow instruction above. Whole wheat pasta has a slightly harder texture and it's ideal for [[Pasta e fagioli|pasta e fagioli]].\n===Drying hand-made pasta===\nSince this recipe was written, I've found a far easier way to dry hand rolled pasta, especially if you're just going to rustically hand cut it.  Shake a generous amount of [[fine yellow cornmeal]] onto a work surface and lay the pasta sheets on the cornmeal once it has been rolled out to your desired thickness. Leave it an hour or more to dry out and then you can then cut it to any shape you want.  The cornmeal prevents it from sticking to the work surface and unlike flour, most of the cornmeal falls off as you handle the pasta.  What doesn't fall off, separates during the boiling process.\n\n===Dried pasta===\nDried pasta is fresh pasta that has been air dried to remove all moisture.  Most dried pasta is not made with egg so will keep for years.  If pasta has been made with egg it will only keep for a few days and should be refrigerated whilst it is being stored.\n===Cooked rice and food safety===\nCooked pasta and cooked rice is a primary source of [[bacillus cereus food poisoning]]. Once pasta or rice is cooked it should be promptly consumed or kept hot (over 60\u00b0C [140\u00b0F]) or refrigerated (below 4\u00b0C [40\u00b0F]).  It must not be left at room temperature.\n== How much does one cup of pasta weigh? ==\n\n''Estimated [[Generic_conversion_table#Volume|US cup]] to weight equivalents:''\n\n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"2\" width=\"500\">\n\n  <tr>\n\n    <td colspan=\"2\"><strong>Ingredient</strong></td>\n\n    <td><strong>US Cups </strong></td>\n\n    <td><strong>Grams</strong></td>\n\n    <td><strong>Ounces</strong></td>\n\n  </tr>\n\n    \n\n  <tr>\n\n    <td>Pasta</td>\n\n    <td>short cut - dry</td>\n\n    <td><div align=\"center\">1</div></td>\n\n    <td>100 grams</td>\n\n    <td>4 ounces</td>\n\n  </tr>\n\n    \n\n  <tr>\n\n    <td>Pasta</td>\n\n    <td>short cut - cooked</td>\n\n    <td><div align=\"center\">1</div></td>\n\n    <td>200 grams</td>\n\n    <td>7 ounces</td>\n\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\n'''Conversion notes:'''<br />\n\nEvery [[ingredient]] has a cups to ounces or grams conversion table.

It is a [[Stew|stew]] made with \"[[Oxtail|oxtail]]\" (in fact, usually tail of a calf) and various [[Vegetables|vegetables]]. Its introduction [[Dates|dates]] back to times when it was customary to pay a vaccinaro ([[Cattle|cattle]] butcher) in kind with the entrails, hide, and tail of the animal. Butchers developed a way of turning their fee into a delicacy, thus coda alla vaccinara was formed. Today, almost every Roman household has its unique recipe to cook coda.\n\nTail of the [[Veal|veal]] is [[Parboiled|parboiled]] and then [[Simmered|simmered]] with large amounts of [[Celery|celery]], [[Carrots|carrots]], and aromatic [[Herbs|herbs]]. Following this, [[Tomatoes|tomatoes]] and [[Wine|wine]] are added, then the mixture is cooked further with a soffritto of [[Onions|onions]], [[Garlic|garlic]], [[Prosciutto|prosciutto]], [[Pancetta|pancetta]] and some other ingredients. During the final phase of cooking, a [[Bouquet garni|bouquet garni]] of [[Bay leaves|bay leaves]], celery stalks, and [[Cloves|cloves]] are put in the pot for flavouring. Tail should be cooked such a long time that [[Meat|meat]] should be easily separated from the vertebrae. The meal is seasoned with [[Cinnamon|cinnamon]], [[Nutmeg|nutmeg]], and [[Black pepper|black pepper]] and garnished with [[Pine nuts|pine nuts]].\n\nAn important point is to obtain a sweet-and-sour taste. The most common way is to add [[Raisins|raisins]] although many people may prefer to use candied [[Fruits|fruits]] or sweetbitter [[Chocolate|chocolate]]. Coda should be cooked one or two days before it is served and be reheated. The leftover meal is never wasted since it may also be well employed as a delicious [[pasta]] sauce.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 1 kg (2.25 lb) [[Oxtail|oxtail]], sliced into pieces\n| 2 [[Carrots|carrots]], scrubbed, 1 quartered, the other sliced\n| 2 [[Onions|onions]], peeled, 1 chopped, 1 quartered\n| 1 [[Bouquet garni for beef|bouquet garni for beef]], take your pick!\n| 4 tablespoons [[Olive oil|olive oil]]\n| 50 g [[Pork|pork]] [[Fat|fat]], smashed with a rolling pin\n| 1 clove of [[Garlic|garlic]], peeled and smashed under a knife\n| 175 ml (6 fl oz) [[Dry white wine|dry white wine]] or [[Sherry|sherry]]\n| 750 ml (1.25 [[Pints|pints]]) [[Passata di pomodoro|passata di pomodoro]] or canned plum [[tomatoes]], chopped.\n| 4 [[Celery hearts|celery hearts]], cut into moons\n| 200 ml [[Beef stock|beef stock]]\n| 75 g [[Raisins|raisins]]\n| A little nice vinegar (cider,sherry etc)\n| [[Sea Salt|sea salt]] and [[Freshly ground black pepper|freshly ground black pepper]]\n| Chopped [[parsley]] to garnish\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| To a large pan of [[Boiling|boiling]] [[Salted|salted]] water, add the [[Oxtail|oxtail]], 1 quartered [[Carrot|carrot]], 1 quartered [[Onion|onion]], the [[Bouquet garni|bouquet garni]] and a grind of [[Pepper|pepper]]\n| Bring this back to the [[Boil|boil]] and then reduce the heat and [[Simmer|simmer]] for 1 hour\n| In large heavy [[frying pan]] or [[wok]], heat the [[Olive oil|olive oil]], [[Pork|pork]] [[Fat|fat]] and another grind of [[Pepper|pepper]]. Add the chopped [[Onion|onion]] and the smashed [[Garlic|garlic]].  Heat until the garlic starts to turns [[Brown|brown]], then once it has flavoured the [[Oil|oil]], remove and discard it, leaving the [[onion]] in the pan\n| Drain the [[Oxtail|oxtail]] and reserve the [[stock]] for use with another recipe, add to the [[Oil|oil]] and [[Brown|brown]] it on all sides\n| Pour in the [[Wine|wine]] or [[Sherry|sherry]], [[Deglaze|deglaze]] the pan, scraping any goodness from the bottom.

Thank you Jamie.]]\nHaving the benefit of [[Chickens|free range chickens]], this recipe is often used and is far superior to even the very best shop bought fresh pasta.\n\nIt's easier with a pasta machine, but by no means impossible without.  Use Jamie Oliver's trick, with a [[rolling pin]], roll the pasta into a few sheets at the thickness you require, then slice into rustic strips with a knife. Simple.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 100 g [[Italian grade 'OO' flour]] or [[plain flour]]\n| 1 whole [[:Category:Egg recipes|free range egg]]\n| 1 [[:Category:Egg recipes|free range egg yolk]]\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Add all of the [[flour]] into a [[food processor]] and give it a whizz\n| Add the whole [[egg]] and the [[yolk]] and blitz it until it resembles rice grains, about 2 minutes or so\n| If it turns floury add a tiny drop of water\n| Likewise, if it stays as wet [[dough]], add a little more [[flour]]\n| Once it's rice-like, knock out onto a lightly dusted worktop and [[Kneading bread|knead]] into a ball, place in a bowl and cover with a dampened tea-towel for an hour or so\n| Divide into 3 or 4 balls, placing unused balls back in the covered bowl\n| With a rolling pin, roughly roll out each ball so it fits into your pasta machine, and  repeatedly run through the machine, from the thickest setting, to the final thickness\n| It's useful if you can hang the pasta over a skewer until it's ready to use or it tends to stick together\n| In the biggest pan you have (10 pints water / 1 lb pasta) bring water with a pinch of [[salt]], to the boil - no oil required\n| Once on a rolling boil, add the pasta, a quick stir with a chop-stick or long spoon to prevent sticking\n| The texture you should be aiming for is [[al-dente]] - a little resistance when you bite; rabbit like! This only takes a few minutes with fresh pasta\n| Once [[al-dente]], remove, drain and serve\n}}\n===By weight: ratio of [[flour]] to [[eggs]]===\nTo calculate the exact amount of [[eggs]] to [[flour]], by weight, use 3 parts [[flour]] to 2 parts [[egg]].  To make a rich ''Royal pasta dough'', use only the egg yolks, reserving a little of the white should you need to moisten the dough a little.\n\nIf using this method, weigh the eggs first and then multiply that by 1.5 to calculate the amount of flour you will need.\n===Variations===\n\nA handful of [[spinach]] leaves will produce green pasta, [[tomato puree]] - red; experiment with colours. You may need to add slightly more [[flour]] if your additions already contain water (as with spinach)\n\nTo make whole wheat pasta use three quarters of durum wheat flour and one quarter of chickpea flour with a little bit of water and olive oil, no eggs. \n\nWhole wheat flour and spelt flour can be used as well, always with a little bit of water and oil. Once you have done the dough, leave it in the fridge for half an hour: it will be easier to roll it out. Follow instruction above. Whole wheat pasta has a slightly harder texture and it's ideal for [[Pasta e fagioli|pasta e fagioli]].\n===Drying hand-made pasta===\nSince this recipe was written, I've found a far easier way to dry hand rolled pasta, especially if you're just going to rustically hand cut it.  Shake a generous amount of [[fine yellow cornmeal]] onto a work surface and lay the pasta sheets on the cornmeal once it has been rolled out to your desired thickness. Leave it an hour or more to dry out and then you can then cut it to any shape you want.  The cornmeal prevents it from sticking to the work surface and unlike flour, most of the cornmeal falls off as you handle the pasta.  What doesn't fall off, separates during the boiling process.\n\n===Dried pasta===\nDried pasta is fresh pasta that has been air dried to remove all moisture.  Most dried pasta is not made with egg so will keep for years.  If pasta has been made with egg it will only keep for a few days and should be refrigerated whilst it is being stored.\n===Cooked rice and food safety===\nCooked pasta and cooked rice is a primary source of [[bacillus cereus food poisoning]].

Leave for 10 minutes. \n| Meanwhile, rinse the [[Rice|rice]] and place in a pan with 450ml cold water. Bring to the [[Boil|boil]], then immediately reduce the heat to very low and cover the pan. Cook for 10 minutes. Turn off the heat and leave, covered, for 10 minutes.\n| [[Boil]] the kettle. Preheat the [[Grill|grill]] to its highest setting. Rinse the [[Fish|fish]] and pat dry with kitchen paper.\n| Smear the [[Fish|fish]] fillets with [[Olive oil|olive oil]], place on 15cm [[Foil|foil]] squares and fold up the edges to make little boat.\n| Splash each fillets with 1 tablespoon [[Balsamic|balsamic]]. Place on the [[Grill pan|grill pan]] and cook, placed about 6cm from the heat, for 5-8 minutes, depending on the thickness of the fillet, until just cooked through. If more convenient, cook the [[Fish|fish]] in hot [[Oven|oven]] (400F/200C/gas mark 6).\n| Cook the [[Spinach|spinach]] for 1 minute in [[Boiling|boiling]] [[Salted|salted]] water. Drain in a [[Colander|colander]], pressing out excess water.\n}}\n\n(''Lindsey Bareham in The Times'')\n\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Grilled White Fish with Balsamic Vinegar grilling.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Grilling\nImage:Grilled White Fish with Balsamic Vinegar marinading.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Marinading\n</gallery>\n\n===Serving suggestions===\nSlip [[Fish|fish]] and juices on to a plate and serve with the [[Rice|rice]] and [[Spinach|spinach]].\n===Variations===\nInstead of grilling in tin-foil 'boats', I just marinaded the fish for 2 hours in [[balsamic vinegar]] and [[olive oil]] and then grilled for about 4 minutes a side, turning once - lightly oil the grill tray first to prevent sticking.\n\nThis was very nice served with [[new potatoes]] ([[Potatoes#Pictures of varieties of potatoes|Pink Fir Apple]]) and a small salad.\n\n{{Template:Belazu attribution}}\n===Belazu products used in this recipe===\n* [http://www.mybelazu.com/details/balsamic-vinegar.html Belazu Balsamic Vinegar]\n* [http://www.mybelazu.com/details/early-harvest.html Belazu Early Harvest Extra Virgin Olive Oil Unfiltered]\n* [http://www.mybelazu.com/products/extra virgin-olive-oils.html Belazu Extra virgin olive oil]\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Belazu recipes]]\n[[Category:Recipes from other sites]]\n[[Category:Fish recipes]]\n[[Category:Italian recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Sea fish recipes]]\n[[Category:Grilled, griddled or barbecued]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#fish #grilledwhitefishwithbalsamicvinegar #spinach #oliveoil #boil #rice #balsamicvinegar #belazu #grill #basa #balsamic </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"

It takes about 5 minutes. Turn the dough out onto a [[Semolina|semolina]] dusted work surface and let stand for 5 minutes. Then [[Knead|knead]] for 5 minutes until the dough is very smooth, and similar in texture to plasticene. Cover the ball of dough with [[Cling Film|cling film]] and allow to [[Rest for|rest for]] a least 2 hours in the [[Fridge|fridge]] \n| To make the [[Sauce|sauce]], put a tablespoon of [[Groundnut oil|groundnut oil]] into a large [[Saucepan|saucepan]]. Gently [[Fry|fry]] the [[Onions|onions]] for a minute or so then add the [[Curry leaves|curry leaves]] and [[Tomatoes|tomatoes]]. Cook until tomatoes have softened, then add the water, [[Coriander|coriander]] [[Roots|roots]] and [[Fish stock|fish stock]]. [[Simmer]] for 20 minutes, then strain and check seasoning and set aside \n| To make the [[Ravioli|ravioli]] filling, [[Steam|steam]] the [[Lobster|lobster]] for four minutes. Remove from heat, and allow to cool a little, then chop finely. Place two thirds of the lobster in a [[Food processor|food processor]] along with the [[Chilli|chilli]], [[Spring onions|spring onions]], [[Milk|milk]], [[Cream cheese|cream cheese]] and [[Parsley|parsley]], and whizz until very smooth. Then stir the remaining lobster into the mix, and set aside \n| To make the [[Ravioli|ravioli]], roll the [[Pasta|pasta]] out thinly and pass through a [[Pasta machine|pasta machine]] until almost translucent. Place on a floured surface and cut out 12 x 8cm circles. Put a heaped teaspoon of the [[Lobster|lobster]] mixture in the centre of 6 of the circles, then smear a little water around the edge. Pop another disc of pasta on top, smoothing the edges together ensuring that there aren't any air bubbles inside, and seal the edges well. Place on a plate sprinkled with fine [[Semolina|semolina]], to stop the ravioli sticking together. Repeat with the other half of the pasta to create a total of 6 pieces. This can be done 3-4 hours in advance, if needs be \n| Finally get a large pan of [[Boiling|boiling]] [[Salted|salted]] water going. Once at a rolling [[Boil|boil]], gently add the [[Pasta|pasta]] and cook for 4-5 minutes. Meanwhile reheat the [[Sauce|sauce]] and divide between two [[Soup|soup]] plates. Add three [[Ravioli|ravioli]] each, garnish with some [[Salad|salad]] leaves and serve\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe with your favourite [[Salad|salad]] leaves\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Italian recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Fish recipes]]\n[[Category:Pasta recipes]]\n[[Category:Sea fish recipes]]\n[[Category:Shellfish recipes]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n[[Category:Nik and Edwina's Cookbook recipes]]\n[[Category:Boiled or simmered]]\n[[Category:Recipes from other sites]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#pasta #lobster #semolina #sauce #ravioli #groundnutoil #salad #coriander #springonions #creamcheese #parsley </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"

Also experiment with different [[Oils|oils]] such as [[Avocado oil|avocado oil]], but make sure they have a fairly high smoke point.\n\nYou can make the whole thing in a [[Breadmaker|breadmaker]], but you will have a brick shaped loaf.  However, you can use it to do the hard work for stages 2-7.  In either case, select the Italian setting or the setting for which you have a [[Focaccia|focaccia]] recipe in the manufacturer's recipe booklet.  For the [[Panasonic SD-ZB2502 automatic breadmaker]], use menu option 21, French dough rise.\n===Chef's notes===\nThe tin I used to make this bread is made by Falcon,  It is an '''[http://www.amazon.co.uk/Falcon-Enamel-24cm-Oblong-Dish/dp/B000TAVXYI/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1310850610&sr=8-3 enamel pie dish]''' measuring 24cm and is just right for this bread.  \n\nThese dishes are easy to clean - if anything sticks, just soak in hot water for a short while.

Slowly braised, this relatively tough, yet flavourful cut of meat becomes meltingly tender, and the connective tissues and [[Marrowbone|marrow]] dissolve into the sauce, making it rich and creamy.\n[[Image:Ossobuco ready to cook.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Ready to go]]\n\nThe shank is a relatively cheap cut of [[veal]] which is readily available in most good supermarkets and butcher shops. Look for meaty hind-shanks cut from the top of the thigh with a high proportion of meat-to-bone; each piece should be about 5\" across and 1\" to 1&frac12;\" thick.\n\nTraditionally, '''ossobuco''' is made without [[tomatoes]] (these being unknown in Milan until the late 19th century). However, the traditional version, prepared with [[cinnamon]], [[allspice]], [[bay leaf]] and [[gremolata]] called in bianco, has by and large been replaced with the newer version which includes [[tomatoes]] and the 'holy trinity' of Italian cooking: [[carrot]], [[celery]] and [[onion]], flavoured with a [[bouquet garni]] and without [[gremolata]] (although 'hybrid' versions exist which include both [[tomato]] and [[gremolata]]). It should be noted that while the traditional combination with [[risotto alla milanese]] is perfect for the former version (for which is was intended), the modern-day version with [[tomato]], which is both moister and bolder in flavour and does not combine well with [[saffron]], is better served with [[polenta]]. The following recipe is for a 'modern' version.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 4 slices [[veal hind shank]], about 1\" to 1&frac12;\" (2.5cm to 4cm) thick\n| 1 medium [[onion]], chopped finely\n| 3 ribs [[celery]] with leaves, chopped finely\n| 1 medium [[carrot]], chopped finely\n| 2 [[cloves garlic, crushed]]\n| 3 tablespoons [[butter]]\n| 4 tablespoons [[olive oil]]\n| 1 cup (240ml) dry white [[wine]] or white [[vermouth]]\n| 2 cups (about 480ml) [[beef stock]]\n| 3 tablespoons [[tomato puree]]\n| 6 [[anchovy]] fillets, mashed\n| &frac12; teaspoon dried [[thyme]]\n| 2-3 [[bay leaves]]\n| 2 strips [[lemon]] peel\n| [[Sea salt]]\n| Freshly ground [[black pepper]]\n| [[Plain  flour]]\n\n}}\n\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n* Preheat oven to 175\u00b0C (350\u00b0F - gas 4).\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| If the butcher has not done so, tie the [[veal shanks]] around the middle with [[kitchen twine]]; this will keep them from falling apart during cooking.\n| Choose a heavy, covered roasting pan or [[Dutch oven]] which will just accommodate the [[veal shanks]] in one layer. Put the [[butter]], 2 tablespoons of the oil, the [[onions]], [[celery]] and [[carrots]] in the pan and [[saut\u00e9]] over medium heat until the vegetables have wilted, about 8 minutes. Add the [[Garlic|garlic]] and [[lemon peel]] and saut\u00e9 until they're fragrant, about 2 minutes more. Remove from the heat.\n| Meanwhile, heat the remaining oil in a skillet until it is near the smoking point. Lightly flour the [[veal shanks]] and slip them into the oil. Richly brown the [[veal shanks]] on both of the cut sides, then place them in the roasting pan on top of the vegetables.\n| Place the wine in the skillet and boil until reduced by one-half, [[deglaze]] the pan, scraping up any brown residue. Pour this over the [[veal shanks]].\n| Heat the [[beef stock]] to a boil in the skillet, whisking in the [[tomato puree]] and [[anchovies]]. Add this to the [[veal shanks]], along with the herbs, several grindings of [[pepper]], and a large pinch of [[salt]]. The liquid should cover &frac34; of the shanks. If not, add extra water.\n| Bring the pot to a simmer, cover, and place in the oven. Cook for approximately 2 hours, turning and basting the shanks every &frac12; hour. If you notice that the cooking liquids have nearly evaporated, add hot water, about &frac12; cup at a time. The veal is done when it is fork tender and falling from the bone.\n| Transfer the shanks to a platter, remove the strings, and cover to keep warm. If the sauce seems watery, as is probable, place the pan on the stove top over high heat and reduce the cooking liquid until the sauce has a thick, creamy consistency. Pour the sauce over the shanks and serve.\n}}\n== Chef's notes ==\n* The recipe calls for [[anchovies]], which enrich the finished sauce without adding a \"fishy\" flavour: don't omit them, even should you not be fond of anchovies.\n* Traditionally, the cooking sauce is finished with a mixture of [[Garlic|garlic]], [[lemon zest]] and [[parsley]] called ''Gremolata.'' It adds a burst of freshness to the finished dish and is highly recommended. [[Gremolata]] consists of the grated zest of one [[lemon]], one finely minced clove of [[Garlic|garlic]], and one tablespoon of finely chopped [[parsley]]. Add this mixture to the sauce at the end of the cooking, as it's being reduced.\n* Osso buco is almost ''always'' served with [[risotto]]&ndash;indeed; it's one of the few examples in Italian cooking where a starch is served with the main course and is a marriage that no man should put asunder. One may, for a change, substitute [[orzo]] or [[acini de pepe]] cooked in [[meat stock]] and finished with [[butter]] and [[Parmesan cheese]].\n===Pictured version===\nThis was a complete success, though a few notes are in order:\n\nAs always, the recipe was made with what we had 'in stock'.\n* 1 very thick steak was easily sufficient for 2\n* 1 big leek instead of the [[onions]]\n* 4 lovely thin [[carrots]] (two sliced, two left as-is)\n* 2 teaspoons of [[Marigold vegetable stock]] in two coffee mugs boiling water\n* 3 tablespoons of [[cornmeal]], I prefer it to [[flour]]\nThis went wonderfully with fresh crusty bread.\n==See also==\n* [[Slow roast recipes]]\n\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Beef recipes]]\n[[Category:Historic recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Italian recipes]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:Stews and casseroles]]\n[[Category:Veal recipes]]\n[[Category:Cooking with wine]]\n[[Category:Stewed, braised or pot roasted]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#vealshanks #gremolata #butter #celery #garlic #onion #beefstock #onions #carrots #tomato #carrot </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"

For the [[Panasonic SD-ZB2502 automatic breadmaker]], use menu option 22, pizza dough.\n\nThis is the recipe I use, it works well without or without the [[breadmaker]], though without the breadmaker I still cheat and use the [[food processor]] to mix it.\n\nThere is a good [[spicy tomato sauce for pizzas|spicy tomato sauce for pizzas here]] and another recipe that will use up your glut of home grown tomatoes, [[spicy tomato sauce for pizzas|here]].\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 1 level teaspoon [[dried yeast]]\n| 300 g (11 oz) [[strong white flour]]\n| 1 teaspoon [[sugar]], ''see [[Talk:Pizza dough|comments]]''\n| 15 g (1/2 oz) [[butter]] or [[olive oil]]\n| 1 teaspoon table [[salt]]\n| 160 ml water - or by weight instead of volume, 160 g water\n| 1 teaspoon dried [[oregano]]\n}}\n\n===Method===\n'''The easy way'''\n* Tip it all in the breadmaker, switch to ''dough'' or ''pizza'' setting, wait for an hour , remove the perfect [[dough]].\n* '''Recipe option code 22''' on the [[Panasonic SD-ZB2502 automatic breadmaker]]\n'''Another easy way'''\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Sift the flour into a bowl\n| Warm the water to body temperature, not hot, stir in the milk powder and salt\n| Take a few tablespoons of the warm water, add the sugar and yeast and leave in a [[warm place]] for 15 minutes.\n| Tip the flour into a food processor with a dough hook or plastic blade\n| Add the dried [[oregano]], butter, yeast mixture and the rest of the water\n| Knead until elastic and not too sticky, adjust with extra flour / water if required\n| Place in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with a damp tea-towel and leave in a [[warm place]] for two hours\n}}\n\n'''The hard way'''\n* Follow the steps above, hand kneading when it comes to the automated part.\n\n'''Make the pizza'''\n* Roll into two balls then roll out into two circles, about 20 cm (8\")\n* Prick the pizza all over with a fork. This prevents it puffing up too much and burning while it is cooking.\n* Transfer to a greased baking sheets and leave in a [[warm place]] to rise again (about 1 hour)\n* Follow your pizza recipe from here...\n\n===Baking in an oven===\nBake for 10 to 15 minutes at 220\u00b0 c (425\u00b0 F - Gas 7)\n\n===Cooking on a pizza stone===\nTo obtain a nice crispy pizza base, pre-bake the pizza base on a [[pizza stone]] under a very hot grill for 2 minutes a side.  Then remove and add the toppings and cook until the cheese is bubbling. Watch carefully though as they can quickly burn in the intense heat.\n\n===Chef's notes===\nAnother advantage of preparing pizza dough in the breadmaker is that once the dough cycle is complete, the breadmaker stays warm until it is switched off, giving the dough a good place to rise. ''True for the [[Panasonic breadmaker]] anyway.''\n\nThe Panasonic recipe suggests adding milk powder to the mix but I stopped doing that years ago and the pizzas are always perfect, so I've removed that from the above recipe.\n\n===How to alter the consistency of the pizza base===\nIf the pizza dough is rolled out and baked immediately, without giving time to rise a little (''my preferred method''), the pizza base has a chewy, doughy middle with a crunchy outside, especially if cooked on a [[pizza stone]].  If the pizza dough is rolled out and left to rise for 30 minutes or more, the pizza base is much more crunch and biscuity - it's your call!\n\n===Water measures given by Panasonic===\nThis recipe in my Panasonic breadmaker book originally gave the water quantity as 210 ml, however, the same recipe in a later breadmakers has the quantity reduced to 170ml and finally to 160ml which makes dough with a perfect consistency.\n===Alternative ingredients===\n\nMakes 4 pizzas.  Apparently, the use of sparkling water (Vichy is recommended) gives a crustier base.\n*10 g easy bake dried yeast\n*450 g OO grade pizza flour\n*1 teaspoon sugar\n*10 g salt\n*25 g olive oil (will work it out in ml later)\n*220 ml sparkling bottled water\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Pizza recipes|Dough]]\n[[Category:Italian recipes]]\n[[Category:Bread and baking]]\n[[Category:Breadmaker recipes]][[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#pizzadough #warmplace #dough #breadmaker #pizzastone #oregano #butter #oliveoil #panasonicbreadmaker #driedyeast #pizzas </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"

Place it about 8cm (3\") from the heat source.\n\nIf using the oven, preheat it to 220\u00b0 C (425\u00b0 F - gas 7)\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| [[Vacuum seal]] the [[Duck|duck]] breasts together with 1 tablespoon easpoon of [[Hoisin sauce|hoisin sauce]]\n| Cook in a [[Sous vide bath|sous vide bath]] for 3 hours at 61\u00b0C [141\u00b0F]\n| Remove from the vacuum bag, discarding the [[Sauce|sauce]], it will have done its job and flavoured the [[Meat|meat]].\n| Slice the duck breast and lay on a paper towel to remove any excess water - these packaged duck breasts seem to be pumped full of water\n| Dust your work surface with [[Fine yellow cornmeal|fine yellow cornmeal]]\n| Divide the [[Pizza dough|pizza dough]] into two and roll out into two thin 25.5 cm (10 inch) [[Pizzas|pizzas]]\n| You can leave them in a [[Warm place|warm place]] for an hour or so to rise. I quite like them cooked immediately they are rolled out for a more crispy finish.\n| Prick the [[Pizza|pizza]] all over with a fork. This prevents it puffing up too much and burning while it is cooking\n| With a deft move, slide the [[Pizza|pizza]] from the [[Pizza peel|pizza peel]], on to the preheated [[Pizza stone|pizza stone]].\n| Cook on one side only for about 2 minutes or until lightly [[Browned|browned]].\n| Repeat for the other side.\n| Remove from the [[Oven|oven]] and cover the pizza base with a good drizzle of [[hoisin sauce]]\n| Crumble a ball of [[mozzarella]] cheese over the pizza\n| Top with the sliced duck and 4 halved [[cherry tomatoes]]\n| Season with salt, pepper a drizzle of [[chilli oil]]olive\n| Return to the [[Oven|oven]] and bake until the [[Cheese|cheese]] is nicely melted. This should take about 4 minutes under a grill on a pizza stone, if oven baking, about 15 minutes in the middle of the oven.\n| Repeat for the second [[Pizza|pizza]].\n| Keep the first [[Pizza|pizza]] warm at the bottom of the [[Oven|oven]] whilst you make the second.\n}}\nOnce the pizzas had been cooked a lot of water was released from the duck.  I just mopped this up with a [[paper towel]] and the pizza was still fabulous.  Fresh duck breasts would not do this.\n===See also===\n*[[Sous vide duck pizza]]\n* [[Crispy duck and hoisin pizza]], similar but with tomato topping\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Italian recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Snacks and light bites]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:Poultry recipes]]\n[[Category:Pizza recipes]]\n[[Category:Favourite recipes]]\n[[Category:Sous vide recipes]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n[[Category:Sous vide cooking]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#hoisinsauce #pizza #pizzadough #pizzas #chillioil #cherrytomatoes #sousvidecooking #mozzarellacheese #sousvide #sauce #warmplace </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"

Some believe that the dish was once popular with Charcoal makers who lived on the Mountains near Rome because the ingredients were easily portable and cooking was fairly uncomplicated. Others believe the dish derives its name from all the freshly ground pepper that is added to the spaghetti at the last minute. Actually, the origin of the dish is quite recent, since it was unknown before Second World War. The dish uses [[pancetta]] or [[guanciale]], which are similar to [[bacon]]. If you want to stay true to the Roman heritage of the dish, you must use grated [[Pecorino Romano]] cheese, but it can be substituted by [[Pecorino sardo]] or [[Parmesan]]. A mix of the two cheeses is also common.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 400 g (14 oz) [[dried spaghetti]]\n| 175 g (6&frac14; oz) piece [[Smoked|smoked]] [[Pancetta|pancetta]] with the rind removed or of course, [[Home smoked bacon|home smoked bacon]]!\n| 2 tablespoons [[Extra virgin olive oil|extra virgin olive oil]]\n| 3 [[Garlic cloves, peeled and crushed|garlic cloves, peeled and crushed]]\n| A good handful of [[Parsley|parsley]], stalks removed and finely chopped\n| 3 large free-range [[Eggs|eggs]], beaten\n| 50 g (1&frac34; oz) [[Pecorino sardo]], finely [[Grated|grated]]\n| [[Sea Salt|sea salt]] and [[Freshly ground black pepper|freshly ground black pepper]]\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| [[Boil]] 4.5 [[Litres|litres]] (8 [[Pints|pints]]) of water in a large pot and add 2 teaspoons of [[Sea Salt|sea salt]]\n| Add the spaghetti and cook for ten minutes - timed once it returns to the [[Boil|boil]]\n| Meanwhile, cut the [[Pancetta|pancetta]] into bite-size pieces \n| Heat a large [[Frying pan|frying pan]] or [[Wok|wok]] over a medium-high heat, add the [[Oil|oil]] and [[Pancetta|pancetta]] and [[Fry|fry]] for a few minutes\n| Add the [[Garlic|garlic]] and [[Parsley|parsley]] and cook for long enough to colour the [[Garlic|garlic]], being careful not to burn it.

That is why we have decided to modify the rag\u00f9 recipe.''\"\n\nThe earliest documented recipe for [[Ragu|ragu]] served with [[Pasta|pasta]] dates back to Imola, near [[Bologna]] in the late 18th century. The academy experts advise [[saut\u00e9ing]] the [[Minced meat|minced meat]] separately from the [[Vegetables|vegetables]] and will allow chopped chicken livers and hearts. Smoked pancetta, [[Garlic|garlic]], and [[Herbs|herbs]] such as [[Rosemary|rosemary]] and [[Parsley|parsley]] are not allowed. [[Brandy]] and [[Flour|flour]] cannot be used for thickening the [[Sauce|sauce]].\n\nSome of the changes may offend traditionalists, and members of the academy acknowledge this. Atos Cavazza, a representative of the Academy's [[Bologna]] branch, noted: \"''This document is not intended to be the [[Sole|sole]] recipe but it is a recommendation to follow.''\"\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| 400g coarsely [[Minced beef|minced beef]]\n| 150g chopped [[Pork|pork]] [[Pancetta|pancetta]]\n| Half an [[Onion|onion]]\n| 1 [[Carrot|carrot]]\n| 12 stick of [[Celery|celery]]\n| 1 [[Glass|glass]] of [[Red or white wine|red or white wine]]\n| 200g [[Tomato puree|tomato puree]]\n| 1 tablespoon [[Tomato paste|tomato paste]]\n| 1 [[Glass|glass]] of [[Whole milk|whole milk]]\n| light [[Meat|meat]] or [[Vegetable|vegetable]] [[Broth|broth]] ([[Stock cubes|stock cubes]] permitted)\n| 3 tablespoon [[Extra virgin Olive oil|extra virgin olive oil]]\n| [[Salt]] and [[Pepper|pepper]]\n}}\n\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| Begin by placing the [[Pancetta|pancetta]] in a [[Dutch Oven|dutch oven]] that is at room temperature, and then place it over medium heat.\n| Allow the pancetta to render its [[Fat|fat]] before adding the chopped [[Celery|celery]], [[Carrots|carrots]] and [[Onion|onion]], followed by a pinch of [[Salt|salt]]. \n| Let it soften for around 5 minutes before adding the [[Ground beef|ground beef]] that has been coarsely [[Ground|ground]], and break it apart in the pan.\n| [[Brown]] the [[Meat|meat]] well for approximately 5 minutes over high heat.\n| Once the [[Meat|meat]] is [[Browned|browned]], pour in the [[Wine|wine]] and allow it to reduce until the pan is almost [[Dry|dry]].\n| Pour in the [[Broth|broth]] and [[Passata|passata]] until the meat is fully covered. Reduce the heat to low and let it [[Simmer|simmer]] uncovered for approximately an hour.\n| After an hour has passed, add the [[MILK|milk]] and continue cooking over low heat for another hour. If it looks like the mixture is getting [[Dry|dry]], add more [[Broth|broth]] or water as necessary.\n| It's important to stir every 15 minutes or so throughout the cooking process.\n| After two hours have passed, turn off the heat and serve with [[Fresh pasta|fresh pasta]] such as [[Tagliatelle|tagliatelle]] or fettuccine made with [[Eggs|eggs]].\n}}\n\n\n===Recipe source===\n* The official recipe for [[Ragu|ragu]] served with [[Pasta|pasta]] or [[Bolognaise|bolognaise]] [[Pasta sauce|pasta sauce]] as defined by the committee of the [[Italian]] [[Cookery]] Academy, 2023\n===Chef's notes===\n[[Tomato puree]] and [[Tomato paste|tomato paste]] are both made from cooked, [[Strained|strained]] [[Tomatoes|tomatoes]], but there are some differences between them.\n\n[[Tomato puree]] is a smooth and thick liquid that is made by cooking and straining fresh [[Tomatoes|tomatoes]]. It has a bright red color and a relatively thin consistency, similar to that of a thick [[Soup|soup]]. It may have some seasonings or other [[Vegetables|vegetables]] added to it, but it does not usually have any added [[Sugar|sugar]]. [[Tomato]] [[Puree|puree]] is commonly used as a base for [[Sauces|sauces]], [[Soups|soups]], [[Stews|stews]], and other dishes.\n\n[[Tomato paste]], on the other [[Hand|hand]], is a thick and concentrated paste made by cooking down [[Tomatoes|tomatoes]] for several hours to remove most of the water content. This results in a thick and dense paste that is very rich in tomato flavor. [[Tomato]] paste is darker in color than [[Tomato puree|tomato puree]] and has a much thicker consistency. It is often sold in small cans or tubes and is used to add intense tomato flavor to [[Sauces|sauces]], [[Soups|soups]], and [[Stews|stews]]. Some tomato paste brands may have added [[Sugar|sugar]] or [[Salt|salt]].\n\nIn summary, [[Tomato puree|tomato puree]] is a smooth and thin liquid made from cooked and [[Strained|strained]] fresh [[Tomatoes|tomatoes]], while [[Tomato paste|tomato paste]] is a thick and concentrated paste made by cooking down tomatoes to remove most of the water content.\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Italian recipes]]\n[[Category:Historic recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Beef recipes]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:Pasta recipes]]\n[[Category:Pork recipes]]\n[[Category:Pan fried]]\n[[Category:Stewed, braised or pot roasted]]\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:12032020'>#spaghettibolognaise #officialSpagBol #officialRagu #2023ragu #bolognapasta #tomatopaste #tomatoes #broth #cookery #italian #ragu #revampedragu</code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"

Half a plastic cup is enough for 2 large pizzas. \n\nThere is a good basic [[pizza dough|pizza dough recipe here]].\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 30 ml [[olive oil]]\n| 1 [[onion]], peeled and chopped\n| 2 [[Garlic|garlic]] cloves, crushed\n| &#189; teaspoon [[chili pepper]] flakes\n| Pinch [[chili powder]]\n| 90 ml [[red wine]]\n| Dash of [[sherry vinegar]]\n| 1 tablespoon [[tomato puree]]\n| 1 x 400 g can peeled [[plum tomatoes]], chopped\n| Big handful [[basil leaves]], torn\n| 2 teaspoons [[dried]] [[oregano]]\n| sprig fresh [[thyme leaves]],\n| 1 teaspoon [[demerara sugar]]\n| 1 tablespoon [[Parmesan cheese]], freshly [[grated]]\n| [[Salt]] and [[freshly ground black pepper]] to taste\n}}\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Tomato sauce for pizza recipe.jpg|Tomato sauce for pizza\nImage:Tomato sauce for pizza slow cooker.jpg|Reducing in a [[slow cooker]]\nImage:Frozen pizza topping.jpg|Frozen in batches, enough here for 20 large pizzas!\n</gallery>\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Heat the [[oil]] in a pan and add the [[Garlic|garlic]], [[chili flakes]], [[chili powder]] and [[onions]] and [[fry]] gently until translucent, about 4 minutes\n| Add the [[paprika powder]], [[red wine]] and [[sherry vinegar]] and [[simmer]] to reduce by half\n| Add the chopped [[tomatoes]] to the pan with the [[tomato puree]] and bring to the [[boil]]\n| Add the remaining [[herbs]], reduce and [[simmer]] for 30 minutes\n| Pour the sauce into a [[food processor]] with a blade and blitz to a puree\n| ''or'', if you have a [[stick blender]], a few minutes with that will have the same effect, ideal if you're using a [[slow cooker]].  \n| Return to the pan and add the [[sugar]] and [[Parmesan cheese]] and cook for a further 15 minutes\n| Season with [[salt]] and [[pepper]], the final consistency should be a paste not runny.  Reduce a little more if required.\n| Allow to cool\n}}\n===Chef's tip===\nRecently I made a huge batch of pizza topping with this years' surplus [[tomatoes]] with the intention to [[vacuum pack]] them into single [[pizza]] portions. I used the basic procedure as above, but for the reducing stage, added the sauce to a [[slow cooker]] on high to 12 hours, uncovered (or until the sauce reaches a nice thick consistency).  The sauce was then frozen into about half full paper coffee and then [[vacuum packed]].  An absolute success.   \n\nIf you are making the sauce ahead of the pizzas and it needs further reduction, just remove from the heat and leave to dry  out a little, naturally.  This works especially well in a large frying pan.\n\nA brilliant, but rather obvious idea that has only come to me recently, is to make double the amount, bag it up and freeze it in one or two pizza portions.  Home made pizzas are great, but sometimes it's too much hassle to have to make the sauce as well.\n\nBottled bolognese type sauce makes a good very pizza topping with very little effort. Freeze the remainder in pizza portion sized bags for the next pizza making session.\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Pizza recipes]]\n[[Category:Italian recipes]]\n[[Category:Dips and sauces]]\n[[Category:Vegetable recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n[[Category:Favourite recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#tomatosauceforpizza #slowcooker #garlic #tomatopuree #sherryvinegar #parmesancheese #tomatoes #pizzas #chilipowder #simmer #redwine </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
