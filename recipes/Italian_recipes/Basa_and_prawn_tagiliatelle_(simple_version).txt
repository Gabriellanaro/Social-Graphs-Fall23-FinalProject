[[Basa]] does not usually have [[bones]] or skin, but remove them if it does.\n| In a large pan, bring the soup almost to the boil and then immediately reduce to a simmer\n| Place the [[basa]] chunks in the soup and simmer for 6 minutes\n| Cook the [[pasta]] as directed, drain and cover\n| Add the [[prawns]] and stir for a minute or so\n| Pour the [[pasta]] into the soup, mix well\n| Arrange on a serving dish\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe hot, maybe with a salad if you need to stretch it to four people.  There is enough here for two gluttons though!\n===Variations===\nSmoked basa works well in this dish also.\n\n{{Template:YoutubePastaDough}}\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Pasta recipes]]\n[[Category:Fish recipes]]\n[[Category:Freshwater fish recipes]]\n[[Category:Shellfish recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Italian recipes]]\n[[Category:Cookery cheats]]\n[[Category:Student recipes]]\n[[Category:Boiled or simmered]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#basa #pasta #boiledorsimmered #peeledprawns #prawns #bones #freshpasta #driedtaglitelle #lobsterbisque </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
