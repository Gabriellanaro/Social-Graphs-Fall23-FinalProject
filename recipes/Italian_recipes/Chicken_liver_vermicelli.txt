Lovely!</span> \n\n<span class=\"reviewAuthor\"> [[User:PSmith|Paul&nbsp;R&nbsp;Smith]] </span></span>\n}}\nThis is a poor mans version of a recipe I saw [[Celebrity_Chefs_on_Desert_Island_Discs#Antonio_Carluccio_-_broadcast_6th_July_2008|Antonio Carluccio]] & Gennaro Contaldo make on TV yesterday.  It was probably from the Two Greedy Italians series.  This is the way to eat chicken livers!\n\nUnfortunately I don't have any Piedmont [[Truffles|truffles]] to enliven the dish so we'll use [[Truffle oil|truffle oil]] and slices of mushroom instead.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| 400g [[Chicken livers|chicken livers]]\n| 1 tablespoon [[Butter|butter]]\n| 1 tablespoon [[Olive oil|olive oil]]\n| 1 medium [[Onion|onion]], finely chopped\n| 1 [[Clove|clove]] of [[Garlic, crushed|garlic, crushed]]\n| A small handful of [[Wild mushrooms|wild mushrooms]], sliced - see variations\n| 75 g frozen [[peas]], cooked for a few minutes in the [[microwave oven]].\n| A good splash of [[Dry sherry|dry sherry]]\n| 250 g [[Fresh pasta|fresh pasta]] (vermicelli, [[Spaghetti|spaghetti]] etc)\n| [[Sea Salt|sea salt]] and [[Freshly ground black pepper|freshly ground black pepper]]\n| 1 teaspoon of [[truffle oil]]\n| 35 g freshly shaved [[Parmesan cheese|parmesan cheese]] to serve\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| Trim the [[chicken livers]] of any veins etc and chop into sugar-cube sized chunks.  Rinse in a [[Colander|colander]] and pat dry with a [[Paper towel|paper towel]].\n| Cook the [[Pasta|pasta]] in plenty of [[Boiling|boiling]] [[Salted|salted]] water.  [[Fresh pasta]] will only take a few minutes and you'll see it change when it's ready - it just looks bigger and softer! Drain and reserve a few tablespoons of the cooking liquid.\n| Meanwhile melt the [[Butter|butter]] in a [[Frying pan|frying pan]], add a good grind of [[Black pepper|black pepper]] and add 1 tablespoon of [[Olive oil|olive oil]].\n| Add the chopped [[Onions|onions]] and sliced [[Mushrooms|mushrooms]] and saut\u00e9 for 2 or 3 minutes.\n| Add the chopped [[Liver|liver]], the [[peas]] and the [[Garlic|garlic]] and saut\u00e9  for about 3 minutes, stirring often.\n| [[Deglaze]] the pan with a splash of [[Dry sherry|dry sherry]] then stir in the [[Pasta|pasta]].\n| Add a knob of [[Butter|butter]], a teaspoon of [[truffle oil]] and two or three tablespoons of the water in which the [[Pasta|pasta]] was cooked, this helps to make a little sauce.  Mix well, season to taste and serve immediately.\n}}\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Chicken liver vermicelli_waiting pasta.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Ready for the pasta\nImage:Chicken liver vermicelli_ingredients.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Chicken liver vermicelli, the ingredients\n</gallery>\n\n===Serving suggestions===\nTop with shavings of [[Parmesan cheese]].\n===Recipe source===\n\n* Adapted from a recipe cooked by Antonio Carluccio & Gennaro Contaldo: Two Greedy Italians - BBC\n===Variations===\nTo add a little texture and flavour, I re hydrated a handful of [[Dried|dried]] [[Shiitake mushrooms|shitake mushrooms]] by soaking in [[Boiled|boiled]] water for 30 minutes, sliced them thinly and added them at the same time as the [[Chicken livers|chicken livers]].  Not very authentic, but it was all I had at the time.\n==See also==\n\n* [[Celebrity Chefs on Desert Island Discs]]#Antonio Carluccio - broadcast 6th July 2008\n\n{{Template:YoutubePastaDough}}\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Italian recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:Pasta recipes]]\n[[Category:Poultry recipes]]\n[[Category:Cooking with wine]]\n[[Category:Pan fried]]\n[[Category:Boiled or simmered]]\n[[Category:Favourite recipes]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#chickenliververmicelli #butter #pasta #truffleoil #chickenlivers #drysherry #oliveoil #peas #freshpasta #parmesancheese #spaghetti </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
