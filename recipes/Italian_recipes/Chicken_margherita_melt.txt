She was very taken with Morrison's [[Chicken]] margherita melt and asked if I could make it as she enjoyed it so much.\n\nThis is my attempt at reproducing a version of it.   The original ready meal came with [[Roast potatoes|roast potatoes]], but I think it would be nicer in flour or corn [[tortillas]].\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| 2 [[Chicken breasts|chicken breasts]], skin removed\n| 2 tablespoons [[Balsamic vinegar|balsamic vinegar]]\n| 2 fat [[Cloves of Garlic, peeled and crushed|cloves of garlic, peeled and crushed]]\n| [[Salt]] and [[Freshly ground black pepper|freshly ground black pepper]]\n| Half a teaspoon of [[Mexican oregano]] - Normal [[oregano]] is perfectly good, but not quite a strongly flavoured\n| 1 [[Egg|egg]], beaten\n| [[Flour]] for dredging - I love to use [[Masa Harina|masa harina]] or fine[[Yellow cornmeal|yellow cornmeal]] for this but [[plain flour]] is fine\n| 1 ball of [[Mozzarella cheese|mozzarella cheese]] thinly sliced\n}}\n'''[[Salsa|salsa]]'''\n{{RecipeIngredientsNB\n| 4 fresh [[Tomatoes|tomatoes]]\n| 1 [[Clove|clove]] of [[Garlic, peeled and crushed|garlic, peeled and crushed]]\n| Small bunch of [[Spring onions|spring onions]]\n| Freshly picked [[Basil leaves|basil leaves]]\n| 1 small [[Red chilli|red chilli]], sliced, [[Seeds|seeds]] removed if preferred\n| 1 small [[Green Indian chilli|green indian chilli]], sliced, [[Seeds|seeds]] removed if preferred\n| [[Zest]] and [[Juice|juice]] of 1 [[Lime|lime]]\n| 2 tablespoons of [[Olive oil]]\n| [[Salt]] and [[Pepper|pepper]]\n}}\n\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n\n* Flatten the [[chicken breasts]] by bashing them with a rolling pin between a sheet of [[greaseproof paper]]; [[Flattening chicken breasts, aka Jamie Oliver chicken bashing|see here for more detailed steps and a neat tip]]\n* Add the flattened chicken breasts to a [[Lock & Lock box]] together with [[salt]], [[Freshly ground black pepper|pepper]], [[crushed garlic]], [[balsamic vinegar]] and the [[Mexican oregano]]\n* Clip on the lid, shake like mad to mix the marinade and coat the chicken\n* Refrigerate for a few hours if possible\n* Prepare your grill so you can melt the [[mozzarella]] when you are ready to serve\n* Warm a serving platter\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Chicken margherita melt.jpg|Laid out on a flour tortilla, with a little sour cream too!\nImage:Chicken margherita melt not Jamie Oliver.jpg|Serve yourself!

This helps the beaten egg to stick to the meat \n| Dip the floured chicken in the beaten egg and then pull it through the breadcrumbs and pop them into the hot frying pan\n| Cook for 4 minutes on each side or until the chicken is properly cooked and pop them onto a paper towel\n| Slice the cooked chicken into 2.5 cm (1\") thick strips and place on a baking tray.  I've used a [[silicone baking mat]] as it's easier to clean and does not stick\n| Place the [[mozzarella]] on top of the cooked [[chicken]]  and grill until it's nice and gooey  \n}}\n'''salsa and tortillas'''\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Chop the [[tomatoes]] into eight slices\n| Slice the [[spring onions]] on the diagonal\n| Roughly tear the [[basil leaves]] into pieces to release their aromatics\n| Add these to a bowl together with the chopped [[chillies]], [[lime juice]] and [[zest]], [[olive oil]] and seasoning and mix well\n| Microwave the corn [[tortillas]] for 1 minute to warm them\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe the cheesey chicken from a hot platter and roll up the tortillas together with the salsa\n===Recipe source===\n* My variation on a Morrisons ready meal; Chicken Margherita melt\n===Variations===\nThis would be good with [[rice]], [[roast potatoes]], even as a filling for [[taco shells]].\n===Chef's notes===\nMy original choice was to serve this with pitta breads, that would probably have been a bit easier to eat and less messy than soft tortillas.\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Italian recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Cheese recipes]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:Poultry recipes]]\n[[Category:Grilled, griddled or barbecued]]\n[[Category:Pan fried]]\n[[Category:Favourite recipes]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#chickenmargheritamelt #oliveoil #springonions #roastpotatoes #egg #mexicanoregano #seeds #chickenbreasts #mozzarella #basilleaves #tortillas </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
