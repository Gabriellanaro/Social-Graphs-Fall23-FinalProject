Ciabatta [[flour]] can be obtained online from [[Shipton Mill]].\n\n'''For the [[biga]]'''\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| &frac12; level teaspoon fresh [[Yeast|yeast]]\n| 180g sparkling mineral water\n| 350g ciabatta [[flour]]\n}}\n'''For the [[dough]]'''\n{{RecipeIngredientsNB\n| 10g fresh [[yeast]]\n| 340g sparkling mineral water\n| 50g [[Olive oil|olive oil]]\n| 450g ciabatta [[Flour|flour]]\n| 15g [[Salt|salt]]\n| Extra [[Olive oil|olive oil]] for oiling\n| 20 g [[Semolina]] for dusting - optional\n}}\n===Method===\n\n\n'''The [[biga]]'''\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Dissolve the [[yeast]] in the water\n| Mix all the ingredients in a bowl by hand or in a mixer for 5 minutes until you have a stiff [[dough]].\n| Cover with [[clingfilm]] and leave it in a draught-free area for 24 hours.\n}}\n'''The [[dough]]'''\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Dissolve the [[Yeast|yeast]] in the water and then add [[Olive oil|olive oil]].\n| [[Sieve]] the [[Flour|flour]] and [[Salt|salt]] into a bowl and mix in the water, [[Yeast|yeast]] and [[Oil|oil]].\n| Then, add the [[Biga|biga]] and mix thoroughly.  (This is a very wet mixture so I would recommend using a mixer with a dough hook).\n| [[Knead]] using your chosen method.  (You can also do this using your food mixer on the second highest speed for 4-5 minutes).\n| [[Oil]] another large bowl and pour the [[Dough|dough]] into it.\n| Allow to rise in a [[warm place]] until it has a bubbly and light texture (about 1&frac12; hours), covering the bowl with [[clingfilm]].\n| Gently deflate the [[dough]] with floured fingers and repeat the previous step or leave in the fridge overnight.\n| If the dough has been in the fridge bring it to room temperature before continuing with the next step.\n| Generously flour your work surface and using your dough scraper turn out the [[dough]] in one piece.\n| Flour the top of the [[dough]] and using your fingers, gently dimple it.\n| Divide the [[dough]] into 4.\n| For each piece of [[dough]], fold one side of it into the middle and press down and seal with the heal of your hand.\n| Fold the other side unto the middle, pressing and sealing in the same manner.\n| Finally, fold in half lengthways and seal the edges so that you end up with a long shape.\n| Place the pieces of [[dough]] onto a couche cloth or piece of linen which has been floured with rye flour.\n| Make ruches in the cloth between each piece of [[dough]], to prevent them from spreading too much, but do allow a little spreading room.\n| Cover with tea towels and allow to prove for about 45 minutes.\n| Preheat the [[Oven|oven]] to its highest temperature with a tray half-filled with boiling water placed on the bottom. If using a baking stone, put it in the oven before you turn the heat on.\n| Flour a baking tray or peel, pick up one ciabatta at a time, turn it over, stretching it lengthways a little at the same time and lay on the peel or tray.\n| Transfer to the oven, reduce the heat to 220\u00b0 C (425\u00b0 F - gas 7) and bake for about 20 minutes until light golden brown.\n| Allow to cool on wire racks.\n}}\n===Variations===\nSee also our recipes for [[Ciabatta bread|breadmaker ciabatta]] and [[Parmesan ciabatta]].\n===Chef's notes===\n[[Ciabatta]] [[Freeze|freeze]]s well.  Just reduce the initial [[Baking|baking]] time to 15 minutes, cool, freeze and [[Bake|bake]] for 15-20 minutes straight from [[Frozen|frozen]].\n{{Template:Ciabatta bread recipes}}\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Bread and baking]]\n[[Category:Italian recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes]][[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#dough #yeast #flour #biga #oliveoil #clingfilm #ciabattawithbiga #ciabatta #knead #bertinet #shiptonmill </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
