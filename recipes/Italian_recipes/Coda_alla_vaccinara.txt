It is a [[Stew|stew]] made with \"[[Oxtail|oxtail]]\" (in fact, usually tail of a calf) and various [[Vegetables|vegetables]]. Its introduction [[Dates|dates]] back to times when it was customary to pay a vaccinaro ([[Cattle|cattle]] butcher) in kind with the entrails, hide, and tail of the animal. Butchers developed a way of turning their fee into a delicacy, thus coda alla vaccinara was formed. Today, almost every Roman household has its unique recipe to cook coda.\n\nTail of the [[Veal|veal]] is [[Parboiled|parboiled]] and then [[Simmered|simmered]] with large amounts of [[Celery|celery]], [[Carrots|carrots]], and aromatic [[Herbs|herbs]]. Following this, [[Tomatoes|tomatoes]] and [[Wine|wine]] are added, then the mixture is cooked further with a soffritto of [[Onions|onions]], [[Garlic|garlic]], [[Prosciutto|prosciutto]], [[Pancetta|pancetta]] and some other ingredients. During the final phase of cooking, a [[Bouquet garni|bouquet garni]] of [[Bay leaves|bay leaves]], celery stalks, and [[Cloves|cloves]] are put in the pot for flavouring. Tail should be cooked such a long time that [[Meat|meat]] should be easily separated from the vertebrae. The meal is seasoned with [[Cinnamon|cinnamon]], [[Nutmeg|nutmeg]], and [[Black pepper|black pepper]] and garnished with [[Pine nuts|pine nuts]].\n\nAn important point is to obtain a sweet-and-sour taste. The most common way is to add [[Raisins|raisins]] although many people may prefer to use candied [[Fruits|fruits]] or sweetbitter [[Chocolate|chocolate]]. Coda should be cooked one or two days before it is served and be reheated. The leftover meal is never wasted since it may also be well employed as a delicious [[pasta]] sauce.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 1 kg (2.25 lb) [[Oxtail|oxtail]], sliced into pieces\n| 2 [[Carrots|carrots]], scrubbed, 1 quartered, the other sliced\n| 2 [[Onions|onions]], peeled, 1 chopped, 1 quartered\n| 1 [[Bouquet garni for beef|bouquet garni for beef]], take your pick!\n| 4 tablespoons [[Olive oil|olive oil]]\n| 50 g [[Pork|pork]] [[Fat|fat]], smashed with a rolling pin\n| 1 clove of [[Garlic|garlic]], peeled and smashed under a knife\n| 175 ml (6 fl oz) [[Dry white wine|dry white wine]] or [[Sherry|sherry]]\n| 750 ml (1.25 [[Pints|pints]]) [[Passata di pomodoro|passata di pomodoro]] or canned plum [[tomatoes]], chopped.\n| 4 [[Celery hearts|celery hearts]], cut into moons\n| 200 ml [[Beef stock|beef stock]]\n| 75 g [[Raisins|raisins]]\n| A little nice vinegar (cider,sherry etc)\n| [[Sea Salt|sea salt]] and [[Freshly ground black pepper|freshly ground black pepper]]\n| Chopped [[parsley]] to garnish\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| To a large pan of [[Boiling|boiling]] [[Salted|salted]] water, add the [[Oxtail|oxtail]], 1 quartered [[Carrot|carrot]], 1 quartered [[Onion|onion]], the [[Bouquet garni|bouquet garni]] and a grind of [[Pepper|pepper]]\n| Bring this back to the [[Boil|boil]] and then reduce the heat and [[Simmer|simmer]] for 1 hour\n| In large heavy [[frying pan]] or [[wok]], heat the [[Olive oil|olive oil]], [[Pork|pork]] [[Fat|fat]] and another grind of [[Pepper|pepper]]. Add the chopped [[Onion|onion]] and the smashed [[Garlic|garlic]].  Heat until the garlic starts to turns [[Brown|brown]], then once it has flavoured the [[Oil|oil]], remove and discard it, leaving the [[onion]] in the pan\n| Drain the [[Oxtail|oxtail]] and reserve the [[stock]] for use with another recipe, add to the [[Oil|oil]] and [[Brown|brown]] it on all sides\n| Pour in the [[Wine|wine]] or [[Sherry|sherry]], [[Deglaze|deglaze]] the pan, scraping any goodness from the bottom. Heat until the wine  evaporates\n| Add the [[Passata|passata]] and season to taste with [[Salt|salt]] and [[Pepper|pepper]]\n| Transfer everything from the frying pan to a large, lidded pan, cover and [[Simmer]] gently for 1 hour\n| Add the chopped [[Carrot|carrot]], [[Celery|celery]] and [[Raisins|raisins]] and [[Simmer|simmer]] for another 45 minutes\n| Check the liquid levels at this stage as it can easily dry out. Add a little more water if needed.  Check for seasoning.  I found a little [[sherry vinegar]] added at this stage rounded the flavours nicely here.\n}}\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Coda alla vaccinara - leeks.jpg|thumb|300px|right|In with the leeks and carrots\nImage:Coda alla vaccinara - big cook.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Just before the 'big cook' at step 7\n</gallery>\n\n===Serving suggestion===\nOriginal recipe suggestion: Serve in soup bowls with crusty bread, garnished with chopped [[parsley]]\nMy serving suggestion: Serve with [[spaghetti]].
