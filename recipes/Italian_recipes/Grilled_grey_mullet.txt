To check it is cooked try to remove a small piece: it should come away easily, if not put back in the oven for another 5 minutes and check again.\n==See also==\n* http://www.jamieoliver.com/recipes/fish-recipes/barbequed-red-mullet-with-a-hot-salsa\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Fish recipes]]\n[[Category:Italian recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Sea fish recipes]]\n[[Category:Grilled, griddled or barbecued]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#grilledgreymullet #miseenplace #barbecued #maionese #blackpepper #grilled #rosemary #greymullet #roast_potatoes #grill #lemon </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
