Serve with buttered [[Pasta|pasta]] and a [[Tomato sauce|tomato sauce]].  It's ideal for [[Freezing|freezing]], make double the quantity and [[Freeze|freeze]] in small batches for extra quick meals.\n\nThis has to be a cheat because it's so simple to make.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 500g (18 oz) lean [[Minced beef|minced beef]]\n| 1 tablespoon freshly chopped [[Oregano|oregano]] - ''see variations''\n| 1 small [[Onion|onion]], finely chopped\n| 2 Cloves of [[Garlic|garlic]], peeled and crushed\n| [[Zest|zest]] of 1 [[Lemon|lemon]], finely chopped\n| 15 g (1/2 oz) fresh [[Breadcrumbs|breadcrumbs]]\n| [[Sea Salt|sea salt]] and [[Freshly ground black pepper|freshly ground black pepper]]\n| Pinch of [[Grated|grated]] [[Nutmeg|nutmeg]]\n| 1 [[Egg|egg]], beaten\n}}\n''' for [[Frying|frying]]'''\n* [[Olive oil]]\n''' to serve'''\n* 520 g Buttered [[Spaghetti|spaghetti]] or buttered [[Egg noodles|egg noodles]]\n* 30 g [[Parmesan cheese]] - shaved with a [[Speed peeler|speed peeler]] or freshly [[Grated|grated]]\n\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| In a large bowl, mix all of the ingredients with clean hands until nicely combined.\n| Cover and [[Refrigerate|refrigerate]] for 3 or 4 hours if possible for the flavours to mix.\n| Divide the mixture into about 20 balls, roughly the size of a golf ball.\n| Gently shallow [[Fry|fry]] in a little [[Olive oil|olive oil]] until [[Browned|browned]] on the outside and cooked to your liking. About 5 to 7 minutes, turning regularly - scrape from the pan with a spatula to prevent them breaking up.\n}}\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Italian meatballs, twenty.jpg|20 Italian meatballs\nImage:Italian meatballs, mixed.jpg|Mixed, ready to chill\nImage:Italian meatballs ingredients.jpg|Meatball ingredients\n</gallery>\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe on a pile of buttered pasta or egg noodles and [[Tomato_sauce#Tomato_sauce_recipes|one of these tomato sauces]]\n\nGarnish with shavings of [[Parmesan cheese]].\n===Variations===\nUse [[pork]] instead of [[beef]].\n\nTry an [[Alfredo sauce]] instead of a tomato based sauce.\n\nUse fresh [[Basil|basil]] as an alternative, or a mixture of [[basil]] and [[Oregano|oregano]] (or [[Marjoram|marjoram]]), if using [[Dried oregano|dried oregano]], use 1 teaspoon.  Don't bother with [[Dried|dried]] [[Basil|basil]].\n===Chef's notes===\nI forgot to buy the lemon for this recipe, so used slightly less than a quarter of the rind (flesh discarded) from one of my [[preserved lemons]], finely chopped.\n\n{{Template:YoutubePastaDough}}\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Beef recipes]]\n[[Category:Cookery cheats]]\n[[Category:Italian recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:Pasta recipes]]\n[[Category:Student recipes]]\n[[Category:Pan fried]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#basil #italianmeatballswithpasta #parmesancheese #oliveoil #grated #oregano #freezing #dried #meatballrecipe #panfried #driedoregano </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
