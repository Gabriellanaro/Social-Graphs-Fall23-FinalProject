This could easily be made with any pasta.\n\n[[Cod roe]] is only available fresh during the very limited season (January to March UK) but canned [[Cod|cod]] [[Roe|roe]] is available all year round and the very large cans can be sliced and [[Frozen|frozen]] for later use.\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| [[Sea Salt|sea salt]]\n| 130 g [[Pasta|pasta]] negra\n| 1 x 4cm (1\u00bd\u0094) slice of canned [[Cod roe|cod roe]]\n| 1 tablespoon [[Butter|butter]]\n| [[Freshly ground black pepper]]\n| Freshly cut [[Herbs|herbs]] to garnish\n}}\n\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| Cook the [[Pasta|pasta]] for 7 to 10 minutes in lightly [[Salted|salted]] [[Boiling|boiling]] water (or as directed on the packet)\n| Meanwhile, melt 1 tablespoon of [[Butter|butter]] in a small pan with a good pinch of [[Black pepper|black pepper]]\n| Add the sliced [[Cod roe|cod roe]] to the hot pan and crush with the back of a spoon\n| Cook for 4 or 5 minutes turning regularly.  The [[Roe|roe]] does not really need to be cooked so it's just to add a little colour and get the [[Butter|butter]] mixed in well.  Season to taste.\n| Arrange the [[Pasta|pasta]] on a plate, add the cooke droe and dress with frsh [[Herbs|herbs]].\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nI found [[Horseradish sauce|horseradish sauce]] to be a good [[Accompaniment|accompaniment]] for this.\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Italian recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Snacks and light bites]]\n[[Category:Fish recipes]]\n[[Category:Pasta recipes]]\n[[Category:Sea fish recipes]]\n[[Category:Pan fried]]\n[[Category:Boiled or simmered]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#pasta #codroe #butter #herbs #roe #lunch #boiledorsimmered #pastanegrawithbutteredcodroe #blackpepper #salted #accompaniment </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
