Add the salmon pieces and stir to coat with the garlic oil\n| Pour the soup over the garlic and [[salmon]], almost bring the soup to the boil and then immediately reduce to a simmer\n| Place the [[salmon]] chunks in the soup and simmer for 4 minutes\n| Cook the pasta as directed, drain and cover\n| Add the [[prawns]], [[cream]], [[sherry]], chopped [[parsley]], [[salt]] and stir for a minute or so\n| Pour the pasta into the soup, mix well, serve with [[parsley]] garnish\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe hot, maybe with a salad if you need to stretch it to four people.  There is enough here for two gluttons though!\n\n===Variations===\nThis works well with a few crushed [[bird's' eye chillies]] crushed and added with the [[garlic]].  Mind you, if you love your [[chili]] you probably don't need to be told this!\n==See also==\n{{Template:Lobster recipes}}\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Pasta recipes]]\n[[Category:Fish recipes]]\n[[Category:Shellfish recipes|Prawn]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Italian recipes]]\n[[Category:Favourite recipes]]\n[[Category:Boiled or simmered]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#salmonandprawntagliatelle #salmon #parsley #garlic #cream #drysherry #boiledorsimmered #chili #blackpepper #oliveoil #lemon </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
