[[Dried|Dried]] [[Herbs|herbs]] are not a good substitute.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| 150g of good [[Blue cheese|blue cheese]] - I used [[Saint Agur Blue cheese|Saint Agur]] - nice and creamy\n| 100g thinly sliced [[Smoked salmon|smoked salmon]]\n| 1 small [[Onion|onion]], thinly sliced\n| [[Extra virgin olive oil]]\n| [[Sea Salt|Sea salt]]\n| [[Freshly ground black pepper]]\n| Freshly chopped [[Dill|dill]] to garnish\n\n}}\n\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n\n* Make the [[Pizza dough|pizza dough]] as instructed.\n* If using a [[Pizza stone|pizza stone]], preheat the [[Pizza stone|pizza stone]] under a very hot [[Grill|grill]] for about 20 minutes. Place it about 8cm (3\") from the heat source.\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| Make 1 [[Pizza|pizza]] per person\n| Dust your work surface with [[Fine yellow cornmeal|fine yellow cornmeal]]\n| Divide the [[Pizza dough|pizza dough]] into two and roll out into two thin 25.5 cm (10 inch) [[Pizzas|pizzas]]\n| Prick the pizzas all over with a fork. This prevents it puffing up too much and burning while it is cooking\n| With a deft move, slide the [[Pizza dough|pizza dough]] from the [[Pizza peel|pizza peel]], on to the preheated [[Pizza stone|pizza stone]].\n| Cook on one side only for about 2 minutes or until lightly [[Browned|browned]].\n| remove from the [[Oven|oven]], flip over and add the sliced [[Onions|onions]] and a good drizzle of [[Olive oil|olive oil]] and a grind of [[Black pepper|black pepper]].\n| Slide under the [[Grill|grill]] and allow cook for about 3 minutes, just enough for the heat and the [[Oil|oil]] to take the 'edge' off the [[Onions|onions]].\n| Remove from the [[Oven|oven]] and add the crumbled [[Blue cheese|blue cheese]] and the [[Smoked salmon|smoked salmon]].\n| Return to the [[Oven|oven]] just long enough for the [[Cheese|cheese]] to melt.\n| Repeat for the second [[Pizza|pizza]] whilst you prepare the first.\n| Keep the first [[Pizza|pizza]] warm at the bottom of the [[Oven|oven]] whilst you make the second.\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe with a [[Green salad|green salad]].\n===Variations===\nI used a little [[Truffle oil|truffle oil]] instead of the [[Olive oil|olive oil]], though I have to admit I didn't notice the flavour when eating the [[Pizza|pizza]].\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Italian recipes]]\n[[Category:Bread and baking]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Fish recipes]]\n[[Category:Freshwater fish recipes]]\n[[Category:Pizza recipes]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#pizza #smokedsalmonandbluecheesepizza #dill #pizzastone #pizzadough #grill #smokedsalmon #bluecheese #onions #oliveoil #herbs </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
