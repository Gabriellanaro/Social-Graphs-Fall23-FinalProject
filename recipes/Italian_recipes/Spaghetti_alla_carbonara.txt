Some believe that the dish was once popular with Charcoal makers who lived on the Mountains near Rome because the ingredients were easily portable and cooking was fairly uncomplicated. Others believe the dish derives its name from all the freshly ground pepper that is added to the spaghetti at the last minute. Actually, the origin of the dish is quite recent, since it was unknown before Second World War. The dish uses [[pancetta]] or [[guanciale]], which are similar to [[bacon]]. If you want to stay true to the Roman heritage of the dish, you must use grated [[Pecorino Romano]] cheese, but it can be substituted by [[Pecorino sardo]] or [[Parmesan]]. A mix of the two cheeses is also common.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 400 g (14 oz) [[dried spaghetti]]\n| 175 g (6&frac14; oz) piece [[Smoked|smoked]] [[Pancetta|pancetta]] with the rind removed or of course, [[Home smoked bacon|home smoked bacon]]!\n| 2 tablespoons [[Extra virgin olive oil|extra virgin olive oil]]\n| 3 [[Garlic cloves, peeled and crushed|garlic cloves, peeled and crushed]]\n| A good handful of [[Parsley|parsley]], stalks removed and finely chopped\n| 3 large free-range [[Eggs|eggs]], beaten\n| 50 g (1&frac34; oz) [[Pecorino sardo]], finely [[Grated|grated]]\n| [[Sea Salt|sea salt]] and [[Freshly ground black pepper|freshly ground black pepper]]\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| [[Boil]] 4.5 [[Litres|litres]] (8 [[Pints|pints]]) of water in a large pot and add 2 teaspoons of [[Sea Salt|sea salt]]\n| Add the spaghetti and cook for ten minutes - timed once it returns to the [[Boil|boil]]\n| Meanwhile, cut the [[Pancetta|pancetta]] into bite-size pieces \n| Heat a large [[Frying pan|frying pan]] or [[Wok|wok]] over a medium-high heat, add the [[Oil|oil]] and [[Pancetta|pancetta]] and [[Fry|fry]] for a few minutes\n| Add the [[Garlic|garlic]] and [[Parsley|parsley]] and cook for long enough to colour the [[Garlic|garlic]], being careful not to burn it.
