If you do this, then the cooking time will need to be adjusted accordingly.\n\nI used [[Bird's eye chilli paste|bird's eye chilli paste]] and found that a good &frac14; teaspoon per person was about right.  I allowed 1 bulb of [[Garlic|garlic]] per person, but use as much or as little as you like.\n\n{{Template:YoutubePastaDough}}\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Chilli pepper recipes]]\n[[Category:Fish recipes]]\n[[Category:Garlic recipes]]\n[[Category:Italian recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Pasta recipes]]\n[[Category:Sea fish recipes]]\n[[Category:Spicy recipes]]\n[[Category:Cooking with wine]]\n[[Category:Boiled or simmered]][[Category:Pan fried]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#squid #spaghetti #wine #garlic #mussels #spaghettituttomare #chilli #mussel #carrot #mushrooms #oliveoil </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
