Ideally try reduce this a little over a high heat.  If there is too much then drain some of it, but not all as it makes a very good sauce.  \n| Add the chopped [[Chillies|chillies]] and [[Stir fry|stir fry]] for a few seconds, then add the drained [[Pasta|pasta]].\n| Add the chopped [[Parsley|parsley]], mix well and serve\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe with [[Grated|grated]] [[Parmesan cheese]]\n===Recipe source===\n* Jack and Maureen\n===Chef's notes===\nFollowing comments made by [[Julia]] that there were not enough [[courgettes]], I've amended the recipe for 2 people, by reducing the pasta quantity and slightly reducing the amount of courgettes, but keeping the remaining ingredients the same. I thought this made a good balanced meal.  It will be made again. \nIf you don't cut the [[Citrus fruit|citrus fruit]] once you have removed the [[Zest|zest]], they will be good for juicing for a few days, so they won't be wasted.\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Italian recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Spicy recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes]]\n[[Category:Cheese recipes]]\n[[Category:Chilli pepper recipes]]\n[[Category:Garlic recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegetable recipes]]\n[[Category:Boiled or simmered]]\n[[Category:Stir fried]]\n[[Category:Favourite recipes]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#courgettes #grated #spaghettiwithgarliccourgettesparmesanandlemon #pasta #zest #spaghetti #oliveoil #parsley #parmesancheese #fry #wok </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
