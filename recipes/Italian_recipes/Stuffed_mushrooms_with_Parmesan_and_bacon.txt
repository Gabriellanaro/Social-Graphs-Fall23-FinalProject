If you do,  cook it properly first by frying with the mushrooms. Use dry cured bacon though, or you will find everything swimming in water!\n<span class=\"review\">\n<span class=\"reviewHeader\">\n====Best recipe review====\n</span>\n''<span class=\"reviewTitle\">Moorish</span>''\n\n<span style=\"line-height:180%\"><span style=\"font-size:180%;\"><span class=\"reviewScore\">5</span>/5 </span>\n\n<span class=\"reviewDesc\">I always make these too big, then eat them all.
