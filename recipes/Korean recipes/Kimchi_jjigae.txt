The [[Stew|stew]] is said to be more flavourful if prepared with older kimchi, while fresh kimchi may not bring out a full and rich flavour.\n\nSliced [[Kimchi|kimchi]] is put into a pot with [[Beef|beef]], [[Pork|pork]] or [[Seafood|seafood]], dubu, sliced [[Spring onions|spring onions]] and [[Garlic|garlic]] and are all [[Boiled|boiled]] together with water or myeolchi(&#47736;&#52824;) [[Stock|stock]]. The [[Stew|stew]] is seasoned with either [[Doenjang|doenjang]](&#46108;&#51109;) ([[Bean|bean]] paste) or [[Gochujang|gochujang]] (&#44256;&#52628;&#51109;)([[Red pepper|red pepper]] paste).\n\nLike many other Korean dishes [[Kimchi|kimchi]] jjigae is usually eaten communally from the center of the table if more than two people are served. It is accompanied by various banchan ([[Side dishes|side dishes]]) and [[Rice|rice]]. It is usually cooked and served [[Boiling|boiling]] hot in a stone pot.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 1 tablespoon [[Groundnut oil|groundnut oil]]\n| 175 g (6 oz) [[Pork belly|pork belly]] sliced very thin\n| &#189; medium [[Onion|onion]], peeled and chopped\n| 4 Cloves of [[Garlic|garlic]], peeled and crushed\n| 473 ml (0.83 pint) [[Kimchi|kimchi]] (including plenty of the [[Juice|juice]])\n| 473 ml (0.83 pint) water\n| 1 tablespoon [[Rice wine|rice wine]]\n| 2 teaspoons [[Gochujang|gochujang]] (Korean [[Chilli]] paste) - or to taste\n| 2 teaspoons [[Light soy sauce|light soy sauce]]\n| 225 g (8 oz) Blue Dragon [[Tofu]], Firm Silken Style, cut into bite-sized cubes\n| 2 [[Spring onions|spring onions]], thinly sliced\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Heat the [[Oil|oil]] in a medium-sized pot and [[Fry|fry]] the [[Pork belly|pork belly]] for a 3 or 4 minutes, turning often.\n| Add the [[Garlic|garlic]], [[Stir-fry|stir-fry]] for 30 seconds, then add the [[Onion|onion]] and [[Fry|fry]] for 3 or 4 minutes until softened.\n| Add the remaining ingredients apart from the [[Tofu|tofu]] and sprig [[Onions|onions]] and bring to the [[Boil|boil]].\n| Reduce the heat and [[Simmer|simmer]] for 20 to 30 minutes.\n| Add the cubed [[Tofu|tofu]] and [[Simmer|simmer]] for a further 5 minutes.\n| Finally add the sprig [[Onions|onions]], remove from the heat and serve.\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe with [[Plain boiled rice|plain boiled rice]].\n===Variations===\nUse [[Pork tenderloin|pork tenderloin]] or even [[Bacon|bacon]] in place of the [[Pork belly|pork belly]].\n===Chef's notes===\nI did plan to make this recipe but the [[kimchi]] I made in preparation of this recipe was ok, but not really to my personal taste.
