I have converted it to our standard format and after cooking it , clarified some of the quantities and slightly adjusted the cooking times.\n\nThis is a fabulous recipe and so easy to make!\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 800g [[Chicken|chicken]] pieces (bone in)\n| A bunch of leaves of [[Parsley|parsley]]\n| [[Garlic]] to taste, peeled.  I used 6 fat cloves of garlic\n| Half a medium size [[Onion|onion]], peeled and roughly chopped\n| 2 teaspoons of dried [[Oregano|oregano]]\n| 1 heaped teaspoon of [[Paprika|paprika]] powder\n| 1 large red [[Sweet pepper|sweet pepper]], deseeded\n| &#188; cup of [[Olive oil|olive oil]]\n| 3 tablespoons of [[Vinegar|white wine vinegar]].\n| 2 heaped teaspoons of [[Chicken stock|chicken stock powder]]\n\n}}\n\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n* Preheat the [[Oven|oven]] to 180\u00b0 C (350\u00b0 F - gas 4), [fan oven 160\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Put the [[Chicken|chicken]] in an [[Oven|oven]] tray\n| Put the rest of the ingredients in the [[Blender|blender]] and blend for 2 minutes\n| Try to check taste\n| Pour it over [[Chicken|chicken]]\n| Cover with a lid or [[tin-foil]] \n| Put it in the top of the [[Oven|oven]] for 45 minutes\n| Check the chicken is properly cooked\n| Enjoy!\n}}\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Argentinian chicken ready for the oven.jpg|Poured over the chicken pieces\nImage:Argentinian chicken blending.jpg|The ingredients, ready to [[blend]]\n</gallery>\n===Chef's notes===\nThis recipe is a good candidate for jointing a small [[Chicken|chicken]] - I prefer to also remove the skin in a dish like this, but that's a personal preference.\n\nI added a little extra water after blending as the mix looked rather dry, however this was probably not necessary as the cooked chicken had more than enough sauce. \n==See also==\n* {{See also - Jointing a chicken}}\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Latin American recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Poultry recipes]]\n[[Category:Favourite recipes]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#argentinianchicken #chicken #oliveoil #miseenplace #chickenstock #blend #garlic #sweetpepper #blender #paprika #oregano </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
