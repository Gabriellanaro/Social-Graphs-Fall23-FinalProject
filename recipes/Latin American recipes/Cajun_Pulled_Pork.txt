This recipe uses one of those slices. I can use the other two to experiment with more of the [[Taste Sensation]] seasonings.\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| 1400 g [[Pork shoulder|pork shoulder]]\n| 2 medium [[Red onions|red onions]], peeled and chopped\n| 1 [[Lemon|lemon]] cut into eight pieces\n| 2 tablespoons of [[Taste Sensation Cajun Seasoning]]\n| 200 ml [[red wine]]\n| 1 tablespoon of [[muscovado sugar]]\n}}\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Cajun Pulled Pork ready to cook.jpg|Ready to cook\nImage:Cajun Pulled Pork Ingredients.jpg|Minimal, but high quality ingredients\nImage:Taste Sensation spices with added cats.jpg|A sample of Taste Sensation spices, with added cats\n</gallery>\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| Squeeze the [[Lemon|lemon]] to collect the [[lemon juice]] while retaining the [[lemon]] pieces\n| Pour the red wine and lemon juice over the [[Pork|pork]]\n| Sprinkle the [[Taste Sensation Cajun Seasoning]] over the pork\n| Line the [[Slow Cooker|slow cooker]] with the chopped [[Onions|onions]] and [[Lemon|lemon]] pieces\n| Lay the [[Pork shoulder|pork shoulder]] over the [[Lemon|lemon]] and [[Onions|onions]]\n| Sprinkle the [[muscovado sugar]] over everything\n| Slow cook on medium heat for 8 hours, turning now and then\n| If it looks to be drying out too much add a little extra liquid, water or beverage of your choice!\n| If you are able, about halfway through remove the rind and excess fat, together with the lemon pieces\n| After eight hours, shred the [[Pork|pork]] with two forks and mix into the gravy\n| Serve!\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nThere are lots of great ways to serve [[Pulled pork|pulled pork]]:\n\n* In rolled up soft [[Flour tortillas|flour tortillas]] with crispy [[Lettuce|lettuce]] and [[Onions|onions]]\n\n* In [[Taco shells|taco shells]] with a [[Salad|salad]] mix and [[Sour cream|sour cream]]\n\n* As you would serve [[Roast pork|roast pork]]\n\n* As a [[Pizza topping|pizza topping]]\n\n* In a [[Burger|burger]] bun with a [[Salad|salad]]\n\n* As part of a [[Tapa|tapa]]\n===Chef's notes===\nThis was very, very good.  Impressed with the [[Cajun Seasoning]], not too hot but had tangy, herby notes. I needed to add a little extra liquid near the end, but only 50 ml or so. \n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Recipes from other sites]]\n[[Category:Latin American recipes]]\n[[Category:Tex-Mex recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Spicy recipes]]\n[[Category:Tapas, mezze and antipasti]]\n[[Category:Chilli pepper recipes]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:Pork recipes]]\n[[Category:Slow cooked]]\n[[Category:Slow cooker recipes]]\n[[Category:Taste Sensation recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#lemon #cajunpulledpork #porkshoulder #onions #salad #pork #muscovadosugar #cajunseasoning #tapa #spice #redonions </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
