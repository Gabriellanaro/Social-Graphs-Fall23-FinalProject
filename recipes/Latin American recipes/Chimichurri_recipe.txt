It is told that the unusual name comes from 'Jimmy McCurry', an Irishman who is said to have first prepared the sauce. He was marching with the troops of General Jasson Ospina in the 19th Century, sympathetic to the cause of Argentine independence. The sauce was popular and the recipe was passed on. However, 'Jimmy McCurry' was difficult for the native people to say. Some sources claim Jimmy's sauce's name was corrupted to 'chimichurri', while others say it was changed in his honor.\n\n'''Chimichurri''' can be used as a condiment or as a [[marinade]] for [[grilled]] [[meats]].  It originates in South America and is frequently used in [[TexMex recipes]].\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| &#189; Cup [[Olive]] [[Oil]]\n| &#188; Cup Red [[Wine]] [[Vinegar]]\n| &#188; Cup Water\n| 1 small bunch flat leaf-[[parsley]] chopped finely\n| 4 cloves [[Garlic|garlic]] peeled and crushed\n| &#189; of a sweet [[red pepper]], deseeded and finely chopped\n| 1 [[tomato]]; peeled, deseeded, finely chopped\n| 1 tablespoon [[dried]] [[oregano]]\n| 1 tablespoon [[paprika powder]]\n| 1 [[Bay leaf]] chopped finely\n| 1 tablespoon [[sea salt]]\n| 1 teaspoon freshly ground [[ground black pepper]]\n| 2 tablespoons hot [[chili flakes]] (or to taste)\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| In a large bowl, add all of the ingredients except for the [[oil]] and [[vinegar]] and mix well\n| Leave to stand and amalgamate for 30 minutes\n| Add the [[vinegar]] and [[oil]], whisk well and allow to stand for a further 30 minutes\n| Pour the mixture into a suitable [[sterilised jar]] and refrigerate for 3 days prior to use for best results\n}}\n===Chef's notes===\nAlthough it is ready after 1 hour it is at its best after at least 3 days.\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Ingredients]]\n[[Category:Latin American recipes]]\n[[Category:Spicy recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegan recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes]]\n[[Category:Chilli pepper recipes]]\n[[Category:Chilli pepper recipes]]\n[[Category:Accompaniments]]\n[[Category:Dips and sauces]]\n[[Category:Marinades dressings and butters]]\n[[Category:Uncooked]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#vinegar #grilled #chimichurrirecipe #marinade #texmexrecipes #paprikapowder #sauce #parsley #sterilisedjar #groundblackpepper #chiliflakes </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
