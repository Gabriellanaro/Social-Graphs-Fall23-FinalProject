[[Tin foil]] now provides a modern substitute.\n\nTraditionally, cochinita pibil was buried in a pit with a fire at the bottom to [[Roast|roast]] it. The Mayan word \"pibil\" means \"buried\".\n\nThis version is identical to the [[Cochinita pibil|original recipe]] except that is cooked in a slow cooker. \n\n\n'''Grind to a powder'''\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 2.5 tablespoons [[Annatto seeds|annatto seeds]] \n| 1 teaspoon [[Cumin seeds|cumin seeds]] \n| 1.5 teaspoons [[Peppercorns|peppercorns]] \n| 1/2 a teaspoon [[allspice powder]] or 8 [[Allspice berries|allspice berries]] \n| 5 whole [[Cloves|cloves]]\n| 1/2 a teaspoon [[dried oregano]] \n}}\n'''[[Marinade]]'''\n{{RecipeIngredientsNB\n| 1 [[Onion|onion]], peeled and roughly chopped\n| 2 [[Scotch bonnet chili peppers]] (or [[Chillies|chillies]] of choice) \n| 80 ml [[Orange juice|orange juice]] \n| 80 ml [[Red wine vinegar|red wine vinegar]] \n| 1 tablespoon (30 ml) [[Salt|salt]] \n| 8 Cloves of [[Garlic|garlic]], peeled. \n| [[Juice|juice]] and zest of 2 [[Lemons|lemons]] and one [[lime]] \n| splash of [[Tequila|tequila]]\n| 2 [[Bay leaves|bay leaves]]\n| 2 tablespoons of [[jaggery]] or [[muscovado sugar]]\n| 1.3 kg mixture of [[Pork shoulder|pork shoulder]] and [[Pork]] cheek.\n}}\n'''Misc'''\n{{RecipeIngredientsNB\n| 12 [[Taco shells]], or [[Tortillas|tortillas]] for serving\n\n}}\n\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n* Add the [[Spices|spices]] to a [[Coffee grinder|coffee grinder]] or [[Mortar and pestle|mortar and pestle]] and grind to a powder.\n* De-[[Seed|seed]] and roughly chop the [[Chillies|chillies]]\n* Add the [[Onion|onion]], [[Garlic|garlic]], [[Chillies|chillies]], [[Citrus|citrus]] juices, [[Vinegar|vinegar]], [[Salt|salt]] and [[Spice|spice]] powder to a [[Blender|blender]] and liquidise.\n* Remove and discard the [[Pork rind|pork rind]] and cut the [[Pork|pork]] into 5cm (2\") cubes. Retain some of the [[Fat|fat]].\n* Place the [[Marinade|marinade]] ,[[bay leaves]] and the [[Pork|pork]] in a large [[lock and lock]] box or [[Tupperware]] container, shake well and [[Refrigerate|refrigerate]] for 24 hours, mixing now and then.\n* For a little extra flavour, quarter the juiced [[lemons]] and [[limes]] and add them to the marinade. Discard the lemons and limes before cooking.\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Place in the [[slow cooker]] and cook for 8 hours on low.\n| Shred the meat with a fork and serve.\n}}\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Cochinita pibil marinade.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Cochinita pibil marinating\nImage:Cochinita pibil ingredients.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The ingredients for cochinita pibil\n</gallery>\n\n===Serving suggestions===\nAs far as I can ascertain, the traditional way to serve this would be whole on [[plain rice]] with a salad and [[black beans]] or to shred the meat and serve in a rolled [[flour tortilla]] with a little [[salsa]].\n\nWhen we had this, somewhat unconventionally, we treated Cochinita pibil as you would [[Peking duck]].  Shred the pork, serve with [[julienned]] [[spring onions]], [[julienned]] [[cucumber]], [[green salad]], halved [[flour tortillas]], [[sour cream]], [[garlic mayonnaise]] and a variety of Chinese [[sauces]] such as [[plum sauce]], [[hoisin sauce]] etc.  Spread a [[tortilla]] with [[dips of your choice]], add a little salad and shredded pork, roll up and devour.  An absolute and total success!\n\nThe fourth time I cooked this, we ate half of it 'Chinese style' and made a wonderful curry with the second half. Just fried up some onions, celery, garlic with my favourite [[curry paste]], added a can of [[coconut milk]] and a can of [[chick-peas]] simmered it for an hour or so and served it with rice and peas. That stretched it out for another 2 days!    \n\n===Variations===\nI had no [[tequila]] so used [[dark rum]] instead.\n\n===Chefs' note===\n2 unseeded [[Scotch bonnet chili peppers]] made this dish very hot, delicious,but bearable.  Remove the seeds if you don't want it too hot, or use a different [[chilli]].\n\n{{Template:ThinkPig}}\n\nIf you have made the dish very (chili) hot, it's probably a good idea to separate the meat from the sauce before shredding the meat and serve the sauce separately.  For the sake of your heart, leave it to settle for a bit then drain most of the fat off.  It will be just as delicious, but much better for you.\n\nHaving made this a number of times, I now follow Jamie Oliver's idea for cooking [[slow roast lamb]], let the oven reach its highest setting, the moment you put the meat in the oven, reduce the heat to 160\u00b0 C (325\u00b0 F - gas 3).\n==See also==\n* [[Cochinita pibil]] (same recipe, oven cooked)\n* [[The renowned Mr Brown Pulled Pork - Oriental]]\n* [[Beer pickled belly of pork]]\n* [[Pulled pork]]\n* [[Slow roast recipes]]\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Garlic recipes]]\n[[Category:Latin American recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:Mexican recipes]]\n[[Category:Pork recipes]]\n[[Category:Stews and casseroles]]\n[[Category:Slow cooker recipes]]\n[[Category:Slow cooked]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#pork #chillies #bayleaves #onion #tequila #marinade #cochinitapibil #lemons #garlic #julienned #lockandlock </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
