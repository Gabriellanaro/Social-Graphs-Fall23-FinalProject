It can now be obtained in delicatessens and health food shops in the UK.  Supermarkets may well sell it too.  \n\n'''Please read carefully the article about [[Quinoa|quinoa]] before making this recipe.'''\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 340 g [[Quinoa|quinoa]]\n| 2 small [[Sweet peppers|sweet peppers]], one each of red and yellow\n| 3 [[Celery|celery]] sticks\n| 1-2 [[Green chillies|green chillies]], depending on size and strength\n| 1 large [[Spanish]] [[Onion|onion]]\n| 3 or more Cloves of [[Garlic|garlic]], according to size and taste\n}}\n: The above [[Vegetables|vegetables]] should be quite finely [[Diced|diced]] or chopped.\n* 50 ml [[Corn|corn]] or [[Olive oil|olive oil]]\n* 1 tablespoon [[Lemon juice|lemon juice]]\n\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Take a pan of cold water and add the [[Quinoa|quinoa]].  \n| Bring to the [[Boil|boil]], then [[Simmer|simmer]] for around 10 minutes.\n| Drain and squeeze as much water as you can out of the [[Quinoa|quinoa]].\n| Once cool, mix in a bowl with the [[Vegetables|vegetables]].\n| Shake the [[Lemon|lemon]] and [[Oil|oil]] in a jar with a little seasoning and mix with the [[Salad|salad]].\n| Leave to chill for a short while.\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nWill go with anything really, but I like to serve it as part of a collection of [[Salads|salads]], because the [[Quinoa|quinoa]] adds an extra texture.\n===Variations===\nYou can add any [[Vegetables|vegetables]], but try to keep it colourful,  Sometimes [[Raisins|raisins]] are included.\n===Chef's notes===\nThe easiest way, I find, to  squeeze the [[Quinoa|quinoa]] is to place it in either a [[jelly bag]] or [[butter muslin]] after draining.  Leave it for a while hanging over a bowl or sink and periodically squeeze the bag or muslin until you feel that you cannot extract any more water.\n--[[User:JuliaBalbilla|JuliaBalbilla]] 07:04, 14 January 2009 (UTC)\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes|Quinoa]]\n[[Category:Accompaniments|Quinoa]]\n[[Category:Chilli pepper recipes|Quinoa]]\n[[Category:Garlic recipes]]\n[[Category:Grain and bean recipes|Quinoa]]\n[[Category:Latin American recipes|Quinoa]]\n[[Category:Peruvian recipes]]\n[[Category:Salad recipes|Quinoa]]\n[[Category:Spicy recipes|Quinoa]]\n[[Category:Starters|Quinoa]]\n[[Category:Vegetable recipes|Quinoa]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes|Quinoa]]\n[[Category:Vegan recipes]]\n[[Category:Boiled or simmered]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#quinoa #vegetables #ensaladadequinoaalaperuana #diced #garlic #raisins #oliveoil #spanish #onion #unusualrecipes #salad </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
