Allow a maximum of 75g uncooked rice per person and double the volume of liquid to rice. Eg: 1 cup of rice to 2 cups of water or stock.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 2 tablespoons [[Olive oil|olive oil]]\n| 1.35-1.6kgs [[Chicken|chicken]] pieces \n| 1 medium [[Onion|onion]], finely chopped\n| 1 [[Sweet pepper|sweet pepper]] of any colour, seeded and chopped\n| 3 [[Tomatoes, peeled|tomatoes, peeled]] and chopped\n| Seasoning\n| 1 litre [[Chicken stock|chicken stock]]\n| Small pinch of [[Saffron|saffron]], crumbled\n| 400g long-grain [[Rice|rice]]\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| To remove the starch for the rice, rinse in a [[sieve]] under cold running water until it runs clear. Allow to drain.\n| Heat the [[Oil|oil]] in a heavy [[Frying pan|frying pan]] and saut\u00e9 the [[Chicken|chicken]] pieces until they are golden on both sides.\n| Transfer the [[Chicken|chicken]] to a flame-proof [[Casserole|casserole]].\n| In the [[Oil|oil]] remaining in the pan, saut\u00e9 the [[Onion|onion]] and [[Pepper|pepper]] until they are soft.\n| Add to the [[Casserole|casserole]] with the [[Tomatoes|tomatoes]], seasoning, 425ml of the [[Chicken stock|chicken stock]] and the [[Saffron|saffron]].\n| [[Simmer]], covered, over low heat for 30 minutes, turning the chicken pieces once to ensure they cook properly.\n| Add the remaining stock to the [[Casserole|casserole]], add the [[Rice|rice]] and the reserved solids, stir to mix and bring a [[Boil|boil]] over a fairly brisk heat.\n| Arrange the [[Chicken|chicken]] pieces on top of the [[Rice|rice]].\n| Reduce the heat, cover, and cook over a very low heat until the rice is tender and all the liquid has been absorbed, about 20 minutes.\n| Serve directly from the caserole.\n}}\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Pollo con arroz (Chicken with Rice) cooked.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Pollo con arroz, cooked\nImage:Pollo con arroz (Chicken with Rice) simmer.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Pollo con arroz, rice just in, ready to simmer\n</gallery>\n===Serving suggestions===\nIf desired, [[Artichoke hearts|artichoke hearts]] may be scattered through the chicken\n===Chef's notes===\nI'm afraid I have to add [[Garlic|garlic]] and [[chili]] to most dishes.  This has been no exception.  I added 5 cloves of [[Garlic|garlic]], peeled and chopped, 1 teaspoon of dried [[diced chilli pasilla]] & 1 teaspoon of dried [[diced chili ancho]].
