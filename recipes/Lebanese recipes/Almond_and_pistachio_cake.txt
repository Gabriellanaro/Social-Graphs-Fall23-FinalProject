It contains no [[Flour|flour]] so is suitable for people with a [[Gluten|gluten]] intolerance.\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n}}\n==== For the cake====\n{{RecipeIngredientsNB\n| 185g [[Butter|butter]], softened\n| 185g [[Caster Sugar|caster sugar]]\n| 3 medium [[Eggs|eggs]], beaten\n| 100g [[Ground almonds|ground almonds]]\n| 25g [[Pistachio nuts|pistachio nuts]], [[Ground|ground]]\n| 85g [[Semolina|semolina]]\n| 2tsps [[Baking powder|baking powder]]\n}}\n====To finish====\n{{RecipeIngredientsNB\n| \u00bd [[Lemon|lemon]], ([[Juice|juice]] only)\n| 1 tablespoon clear [[Honey|honey]] (or [[Sweet Freedom]] if preferred)\n| 1 teaspoon extra [[Pistachio nuts|pistachio nuts]] or [[Almonds|almonds]], chopped\n}}\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n\n* Grease (and line if necessary) a 20cm/8in [[Cake tin conversion charts|cake tin]] or a standard bundt tin.  Use the latter if you have one, because this type of mixture can sink in the middle and will cook better if using a tin where the heat can get to the centre more easily.\n\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| Pre-heat the [[Oven|oven]] to 180\u00b0C (350\u00b0F - gas 4)\n| Put all of the [[Cake|cake]] ingredients into a bowl.\n| Using a spoon or a food [[Mixer|mixer]], combine all of the ingredients well, until you have a nice, smooth [[Batter|batter]].\n| Tip into the prepared tin and [[Bake|bake]] for around 40 minutes or until cooked.\n| Leave in the tin for 10 minutes, before turning out onto a rack.\n| In the meantime, mix the [[Lemon juice|lemon juice]] and [[Honey|honey]] - it will combine easier if you put it in the [[Microwave|microwave]] on full for abut 10 seconds.\n| Whilst [[Cake|cake]] is still warm, prick a few holes in it using a skewer.\n| Pour the [[Lemon|lemon]] and [[Honey|honey]] mixture over the [[Cake|cake]], encouraging it to sink into the holes.\n| Sprinkle the top of the [[Cake|cake]] with the chopped [[Pistachios|pistachios]] or [[Almonds|almonds]].\n}}\n===Recipe source===\n\n* Adapted from a recipe in Comptoir Libanais Express by Tony Kitous ISBN 1848094418\n===Chef's notes===\nThe cake will not rise that much, but this is fine as the texture will be just right.  It won't be light and fluffy, but neither will it be heavy.  Ground [[nuts]] do not behave in the same way as conventional [[flour]]!\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Lebanese recipes]]\n[[Category:Bread and baking]]\n[[Category:Sweets and desserts]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes]]\n[[Category:Gluten free recipes]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#cake #honey #lemon #flour #bake #almondandpistachiocake #almonds #pistachionuts #miseenplace #gluten #eggs </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
