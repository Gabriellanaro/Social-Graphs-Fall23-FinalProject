Andy Bates turns baker, whipping up this surprisingly easy no-fuss [[Flatbread|flatbread]] ([[pitta bread]]). Your guests will love the way it pops on the BBQ, and that you went the extra mile to make homemade simple and fresh [[Bread|bread]] for their [[Sausages|sausages]]!\n\nThis recipe is reproduced courtesy of [[Debbie&andrew's sausages|debbie&andrew's sausages]]\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| 500g [[Strong white flour|strong white flour]] or Udi's [[Gluten free|gluten free]] [[All purpose flour|all purpose flour]] Mix \n| 10g [[Salt|salt]]\n| 25g [[Caster Sugar|caster sugar]]\n| 10g instant [[Yeast|yeast]]\n| 20ml [[Olive oil|olive oil]]\n| 360ml tepid water\n}}\n\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| Mix together the [[Flour|flour]], [[Salt|salt]], [[Sugar|sugar]] and [[Yeast|yeast]]. Add the [[Olive oil|olive oil]] and 270ml of the water. Mix the ingredients together. Gradually add the remaining water until all the flour has come away from the sides of the bowl and you have a soft [[Dough|dough]].\n| Place the [[Dough|dough]] on the worktop and [[Knead|knead]] for 5-10 minutes. The dough will be wet in the beginning but will form a smooth dough once kneaded. Place in an oiled bowl, cover and leave to double in size.\n| Remove the [[Cling Film|cling film]] and [[Punch|punch]] back the [[Dough|dough]] (feels good!). On a floured surface, tear off a piece of dough roughly the size of a golfball and roll into a circle about 5-10mm thick.\n| Just before [[Baking|baking]], [[Brush|brush]] the surface of the [[Breads|breads]] with [[Olive oil|olive oil]] and place on the [[Barbecue|barbecue]] for 3-4 minutes on each side. Nice, simple and fresh [[Flatbreads|flatbreads]], perfect with your favourite [[Sausages|sausages]].\n}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Lebanese recipes]]\n[[Category:North African recipes]]\n[[Category:Tunisian recipes]]\n[[Category:Bread and baking]]\n[[Category:Tapas, mezze and antipasti]]\n[[Category:Gluten free recipes]]\n[[Category:Barbecue recipes]]\n[[Category:Debbie&andrew's sausage recipes]]\n[[Category:Grilled, griddled or barbecued]]\n{{Template:DebbieAndAndrew attribution}}\n[[Category:Recipes from other sites]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#dough #oliveoil #sausages #barbecueflatbread #yeast #pittabread #flatbreads #punch #baking #bread #brush </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
