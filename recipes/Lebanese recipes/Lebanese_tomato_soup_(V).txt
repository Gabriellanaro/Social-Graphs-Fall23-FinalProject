It is fairly basic but would make a good start for something more elaborate.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 7 oz [[Long grain rice|long grain rice]], washed\n| 2 oz chopped [[Onions|onions]]\n| 3 oz [[vegetable oil]]\n| 9 oz ripe [[Tomatoes|tomatoes]], finely chopped\n| 2 tablespoons [[Salt|salt]]\n| 3 &frac12; [[Pints|pints]] cold water\n| 1 oz [[Tomato pur\u00e9e|tomato pur\u00e9e]]\n| [[Cinnamon]] powder for garnish\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| [[Fry|fry]] the [[Onions|onions]] in the [[oil]] until just [[Browned|browned]], about 5 minutes\n| In a large pot, add the [[Tomatoes|tomatoes]], [[Rice|rice]], [[Salt|salt]] and water and bring to the [[Boil|boil]] over a fast heat\n| Add the [[Tomato paste|tomato paste]], [[Browned|browned]] [[Onions|onions]] and and remaining [[oil]]\n| Cover and [[Simmer|simmer]] for about 1 hour and 15 minutes\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe garnished with a little [[Cinnamon|cinnamon]] powder\n===Chef's notes===\nNowadays, 2 tablespoons of [[Salt|salt]] seems to be a little excessive.  I would suggest adding just a little and adjusting any seasoning at the end. You can add more but you can't take it away.\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Lebanese recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Middle Eastern recipes]]\n[[Category:Snacks and light bites]]\n[[Category:Soup and stock recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegetable recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegan recipes]]\n[[Category:Boiled or simmered]]\n[[Category:Pan fried]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#onions #tomatoes #cinnamon #browned #pints #panfried #boil #vegetableoil #tomatopaste #soup #rice </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
