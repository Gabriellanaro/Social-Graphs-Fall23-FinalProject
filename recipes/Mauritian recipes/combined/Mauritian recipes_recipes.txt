It was spread throughout the Middle East and South Asia (and Southeast Asia to an extent) by Muslim travellers and merchants, and is popular in Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan and Sri Lanka.\n\nThe name is derived from the Persian word bery\u0101(n) which means \"[[Fried|fried]]\" or \"[[Roasted|roasted]]\".\n\nThis recipe comes from a hand-typed sheet, covered in curry stains, that has been with me since my first Indian cookery course.

It was spread throughout the Middle East and South Asia (and Southeast Asia to an extent) by Muslim travellers and merchants, and is popular in Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan and Sri Lanka.\n\nThe name is derived from the Persian word bery\u0101(n) which means \"[[Fried|fried]]\" or \"[[Roasted|roasted]]\".\n\nThis recipe comes from a hand-typed sheet, covered in curry stains, that has been with me since my first Indian cookery course.  \n\nIt's a bit of an involved recipe but well worth the effort. It is best to [[Marinate|marinate]] the [[Meat|meat]] overnight so prepare this the day before.\n\nI tend to use a large pot of yogurt as I prefer more sauce.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 900 g (2 lb) [[Lamb]] fillet, cubed\n| 125 ml [[Yogurt|yogurt]]\n| 2 cups [[Basmati rice|basmati rice]], rinsed in cold running water\n| 2.5 cm (1\") peeled [[Ginger|ginger]]\n| 4 Cloves of [[Garlic|garlic]]\n| 1 teaspoon [[Chili powder|chili powder]]\n| 1 teaspoon [[Paprika powder|paprika powder]]\n| 2 teaspoons [[Cumin seeds|cumin seeds]]\n| &frac12; teaspoon [[Garam masala|garam masala]]\n| 1 teaspoon [[Turmeric powder|turmeric powder]]\n| &frac12; cup [[Coriander leaves|coriander leaves]] and stalks, chopped\n| 2 large [[Tomatoes|tomatoes]] or &frac12; small tin of tomatoes, chopped\n| Big pinch of [[Saffron strands|saffron strands]]\n| 2 large [[Onions|onions]], peeled and chopped\n| 3 tablespoons [[Ghee|ghee]] or [[Vegetable oil|vegetable oil]]\n| 20 g sliced [[Almonds|almonds]]\n| 20 g [[Sultanas|sultanas]] or [[Raisins|raisins]]\n| [[Sea Salt|sea salt]] to taste\n}}\n'''Leave whole and remove before serving or pick out while eating:'''\n\n{{RecipeIngredientsNB\n| 2.5 cm [[Cinnamon stick|cinnamon stick]]\n| 6 [[Clove|clove]] buds\n| 6 whole [[Cardamom pods|cardamom pods]] ([[Brown|brown]] or white)\n| 2 [[Bay leaves|bay leaves]]\n\n}}\n\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n* In a [[Food processor|food processor]], grind the [[Ginger|ginger]] and [[Garlic|garlic]] to a paste.

Add the chopped [[Tomatoes|tomatoes]] and cook on a low heat until the [[Meat|meat]] is cooked and tender. Add more liquid if needed, but by the time the meat is cooked, some of the liquid should have cooked off.\n| Add half of the chopped [[Coriander|coriander]] or [[Parsley|parsley]], season with [[Salt|salt]] and set aside.\n| In a large pan of [[Boiling|boiling]] water, cook the washed [[Rice|rice]] for 10 minutes only.  Drain and reserve. The final cooking will be done in the [[Oven|oven]].\n| Grease the base of a large [[Oven|oven]]-proof [[Casserole|casserole]] with a little [[Ghee|ghee]].\n| Using the cooked [[Rice|rice]], [[Lamb|lamb]], [[Coriander|coriander]], cooked [[Onions|onions]], [[Saffron|saffron]] and dabs of [[Ghee|ghee]], fill the [[Casserole|casserole]] in layers. \n| Top with [[Raisins|raisins]] or [[Sultanas|sultanas]] and sliced [[Almonds|almonds]], add a few dabs of [[Ghee|ghee]] and cover with [[Tin-foil|tin-foil]]\n| Cook for 17 minutes\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe with a [[Chana daal|lentil curry]] or [[Salad|salad]] of your choice\n===Chef's notes===\nUse [[Parsley|parsley]] if you cannot get [[Coriander|coriander]]\n==See also==\n* [[Chicken biriani]]\n{{Template:PeelingGinger}}\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Indian recipes]]\n[[Category:Mauritian recipes]]\n[[Category:Chilli pepper recipes]]\n[[Category:Lamb recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:Rice recipes]]\n[[Category:Spicy recipes]]\n[[Category:Fruit recipes]]\n[[Category:Boiled or simmered]][[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#lambbiriani #onions #ghee #lamb #rice #coriander #raisins #almonds #ginger #sultanas #yogurt </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
