It's been cooking for four hours now and smells amazing.  I am becoming very impressed with their products!\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| 350g [[beef skirt]] (or [[Stewing steak|stewing steak]])\n| 3 tablespoons [[Taste Sensation fajita seasoning]]\n| 1 whole [[Lime|lime]], un-squeezed and sliced into eighths\n| 1 [[Red onion|red onion]], chopped\n| 1 [[Green bell pepper|green bell pepper]], de-seeded and chopped\n| 250 ml [[White wine|white wine]]\n| 200 ml water\n| 1 can of [[Red kidney beans|red kidney beans]], drained and well rinsed\n}}\n\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| [[Marinade]] the [[beef skirt]] in the [[Wine|wine]] for a few hours if you have the time\n| Pop the [[Meat|meat]] in the [[Slow Cooker|slow cooker]] and pour the [[Wine|wine]] over the [[beef skirt|skirt]] and add the water\n| Cover with the remaining ingredients and cook on a high setting for about six hours\n| Check it does not dry out and that the [[Meat|meat]] is tender and starting to break up.\n| Add the [[Kidney beans|kidney beans]] for the final hour\n| Stir well and serve\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe in warmed [[Flour tortillas|flour tortillas]] with a [[Salad|salad]] and slices of [[Citrus fruit|citrus fruit]]\n===Variations===\nA whole [[leek]], finely chopped looks good as a replacement for the onion, if leeks are in season.\n\n===Chef's notes===\n[[Beef skirt]] is a fabulous, inexpensive cut for this dish.  It does need a lot of cooking, but once it begins to break up into 'strings' as you can see in the 'plated-up' picture you know it's tender and ready to eat.  At this point you can turn the heat down and just keep the meat warm until you're ready to serve.\n\nI added the [[kidney beans]] to bulk out the meal a little, and also as a way to soak up the gorgeous flavours.\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Recipes from other sites]]\n[[Category:Chilean recipes]]\n[[Category:Ecuadorian recipes]]\n[[Category:Mexican recipes]]\n[[Category:Tex-Mex recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Spicy recipes]]\n[[Category:Beef recipes]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:Slow cooker recipes]]\n[[Category:Slow cooked]]\n[[Category:Taste Sensation recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#beefskirt #kidneybeans #beefskirtsteakfajitas #wine #greenbellpepper #tastesensationrecipes #leek #redkidneybeans #lime #whitewine #salad </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
