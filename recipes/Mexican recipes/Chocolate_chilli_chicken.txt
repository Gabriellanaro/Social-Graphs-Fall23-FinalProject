Don't be afraid to experiment with the ingredients - the only thing I would not use is sweet [[milk]] chocolate!\n\nI did actually have [[tomatillos]] that I grew in a Grow-bag with my tomatoes. They were pretty meagre but it's nice to put them to a good use.  Remove the outer covering (husks) before use.\n\nThis was a total success.  Next time I would make double the sauce and freeze the other half as I think the [[mole]] would be good on steak too!\n\n\n'''For the [[boiled]] [[chicken]]'''\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 4 [[chicken]] legs, skin removed\n| 1 [[onion]], peeled and halved\n| [[Salt]] and [[freshly ground black pepper]]\n}}\n'''for the mole [[poblano]]'''\n{{RecipeIngredientsNB\n| 2 [[chipotle chillies]], (deseeded if you don't want it too hot)\n| 1 dried [[:Image:Chilesdearbol.jpg|Chile de \u00e1rbol]].\n}}\n(''Don't be afraid to experiment with whatever other chillies you can get hold of'')\n{{RecipeIngredientsNB\n| &#189; a large onion, chopped\n| &#189; teaspoon [[black peppercorns]]\n| 2 [[clove]] buds\n| &frac14;  teaspoon dried [[oregano]] or [[marjoram]]\n| A very small piece of [[cinnamon stick]]\n| &#189; teaspoon of [[fennel seeds]]\n| &#189; teaspoon of [[cumin seeds]]\n| 1 teaspoon of [[coriander seeds]]\n| 2 tablespoons [[sesame seeds]]\n| 2 tablespoons [[ground almonds]]\n| 2 tablespoons [[raisins]]\n| 2 [[cloves garlic, peeled and crushed]]\n| &frac14; cup [[breadcrumbs]]\n| 2 [[tortillas]], torn into small pieces\n| 5 tomatillos or [[tomatoes]] such as [[sungold]]\n| 25 g (1 oz) [[Green & Blacks Organic Chocolate]], unsweetened (I added a bit more at the end - taste and see first!)\n| 1.5 cups [[chicken stock]]\n}}\n\n'''To garnish'''\n{{RecipeIngredientsNB\n| 1 tablespoon [[sesame seeds]], lightly [[toasted]]\n| 1 [[orange]], quartered\n\n}}\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Simmering mole poblano.jpg|Mole poblano, simmering\nImage:Mole poblano ingredients.jpg|The mole ingredients\n</gallery>\n===Method===\n'''Mole poblano'''\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Don't be too fussy with the chopping as it's all going in the [[blender]] in the end.\n| Blitz all of the dry [[spices]] except for the sesame seeds to a powder in a [[coffee grinder]] or [[blender]] spice attachment\n| Add the remaining ingredients to the [[blender]] and blitz to a smooth sauce\n| Tip the dried spice mix into the sauce and give it a final blitz.\n| Pour the sauce into a pan, bring to a simmer and continue to simmer for 30 minutes stirring now and again\n}}\n\n'''Cooking the chicken legs'''\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Place the [[chicken]] legs in a pan with the onion halves and cover with boiling water, seasoning with salt and pepper\n| Return to the boil, then cover and simmer for 25 minutes\n}}\n\n'''Combining the two'''\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Remove the chicken legs and drain\n| Add the chicken to the mole (sauce) and heat for a further 10 minutes\n| Meanwhile, toast 1 tablespoon of sesame seeds in a small pan\n| Transfer the [[mole poblano]] and [[chicken]] to a serving dish and sprinkle with the toasted [[sesame seeds]]\n| Enjoy Mexico's national dish!\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\n\nServe with [[plain boiled rice]], [[guacamole]] and [[sour cream]] or [[creme fraiche]] and maybe a few [[tortillas]] and a [[green salad]].\n\n===Chef's note===\n\nI could not get Mexican [[chocolate]] so used Green & Blacks organic [[chocolate]], which is bitter and not too sweet. After all, the dish has [[raisins]] or [[sultanas]] which have a little [[sugar]] anyway.\n\n===Recipe too complicated?===\n\nIt's not really, but if you really can't be doing with all these ingredients, I have seen bottles of [[mole sauce]] in some of the larger supermarkets.  \n\nTry it out with the pre-made sauce, then come back and make the real thing!\n\n==See also==\n* {{See also - Jointing a chicken}}\n* {{ChiliConCarne}}\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Chilli pepper recipes]]\n[[Category:Latin American recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:Mexican recipes]]\n[[Category:Poultry recipes]]\n[[Category:Spicy recipes]]\n[[Category:Favourite recipes]]\n[[Category:Boiled or simmered]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#chicken #blender #chocolatechillichicken #sesameseeds #chocolate #mole #raisins #tortillas #molepoblano #sungold #breadcrumbs </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
