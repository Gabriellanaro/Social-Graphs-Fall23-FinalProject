It's really a spicy [[bean]] [[pur\u00e9e]].  It's based on a [[Mexican bean and cheese puree]] and made with leftovers from the [[freezer]].  I added the sliced tomatoes to prevent the bean [[pur\u00e9e]] from drying out.\n\nA fantastic recipe and you would never imagine it was [[vegetarian]]!\n\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 90 g [[Dried|dried]] [[haricot beans]]\n| 90 g [[Dried|dried]] [[butter beans]]\n| 2 [[Litres|litres]] of weak [[Vegetable Stock|vegetable stock]] - I make up half the advised quantity of [[Bouillon|bouillon]] powder.\n| 2 sticks of [[celery]], roughly chopped\n| 1 large [[sweet pepper]], deseeded and chopped\n| 1 bulb of [[garlic]], peeled and crushed (''or to taste'')\n| 1 [[Onion|onion]], peeled and roughly chopped\n| 3 tablespoons [[olive oil]]\n| 1 tablespoon of [[Tex-Mex seasoning]], or [[Old India Taco Seasoning]], or chopped [[chillies]], or [[chilli sauce]].\n| 110 g mature [[Cheddar cheese|cheddar cheese]], roughly [[Grated|grated]].\n| 3 large tomatoes, thinly sliced\n| 1 to 2 tablespoons of yellow cornmeal.  Use '''only''' if the mixture looks far too wet and the end of the slow cooking process.\n}}\n\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n*  When you are ready to start the final bake, preheat the [[Oven|oven]] to 180\u00b0 C (350\u00b0 F - gas 4), [fan oven 160\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour].\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Soak the beans in cold water overnight, rinsing and draining a few times if possible.\n| Add the soaked beans, stock, celery, peppers, garlic, chopped onion, Tex-Mex seasoning (or equivalent) to a [[slow cooker]] on low and cook for 4 hours\n| Using a [[stick blender]] reduce the mixture to the consistency of [[hummus]].  If it is really wet, add a tablespoon of [[yellow cornmeal]], stir well and check in another 15 minutes.  This is a very efficient way of reducing liquid, but use with caution as more than once, I've had to add more stock after doing this!\n| Add 1.5 tablespoons of olive oil.  Mix well and remove from the heat.\n| At this stage the mixture could be [[refrigerated]] or even [[frozen]] and the final cooking stage done at a later time.\n| Once the [[Oven|oven]] is hot, coat a [[shallow oven proof dish]] with 1.5 tablespoons of olive oil and spread the bean mixture evenly over the surface.\n| Sprinkle with grated [[cheese]] and top with the thinly sliced tomatoes.\n| [[Bake|bake]] the [[Puree|puree]] for about 45 minutes to 1 hour.\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe with [[soured cream]] and plain [[tortilla chips]] or broken up [[taco shells]] to use as edible spoons!\n\nThis dish is equally good hot or cold.  Store any unused [[pur\u00e9e]] in a [[Lock and Lock]] style box to prevent it drying out.\n===Chef's notes===\nI used [[dried black lentils]] for the beans and for health reasons, [[olive oil]] for the vegetable oil as this recipe uses rather a lot. For the cheese I used a mixture of mature [[gouda]] and mature [[cheddar]].\n\n===Variations===\nThis is a great recipe for experimentation.  Almost any vegetables can be added to this recipe.  Just use your imagination!\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Mexican recipes]]\n[[Category:Tex-Mex recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Snacks and light bites]]\n[[Category:Starters]]\n[[Category:Tapas, mezze and antipasti]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes]]\n[[Category:Cheese recipes]]\n[[Category:Grain and bean recipes]]\n[[Category:Dips and sauces]]\n[[Category:Vegetable recipes]]\n[[Category:Favourite recipes]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n[[Category:Slow cooked]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#hummus #dried #oliveoil #hotcheeseandtomatohummus #refrigerated #vegetablestock #bean #chillisauce #driedblacklentils #butterbeans #lockandlock </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
