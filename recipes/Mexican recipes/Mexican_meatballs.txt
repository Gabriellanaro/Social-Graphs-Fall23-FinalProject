A Chilli sauce such as [[Salsa de chile a la Jalapa]] should of course accompany this dish!\n\nThe trick to these is to slow cook them.\n\n''&sect; [[User:Miguelmartinez|Miguelmartinez]] from San Luis Potos\u00ed, Mexico, suggests adding some [[Jalape\u00f1os|chipotole chillies]] to the mix to make it redder and tastier.''\n\n'''[[Meatballs]]'''\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 1.5 tablespoons [[Long grain rice|long grain rice]] (white)\n| 340 g (12 oz) [[Minced|minced]] [[Pork|pork]]\n| 340 g (12 oz) [[Minced beef|minced beef]]\n| 180 g [[Courgettes|courgettes]]\n| 2 large [[Eggs|eggs]]\n| &#188; teaspoon [[Mexican oregano]]\n| &#188; teaspoon white [[Cumin seeds|cumin seeds]], crushed\n| 8 [[Peppercorns|peppercorns]], crushed\n| 3 big sprigs of fresh [[Mint|mint]], stalks removed\n| &#190; teaspoons [[Sea Salt|sea salt]]\n| 85 ml finely chopped [[Onion|onion]] (1 small onion)\n}}\n'''[[Sauce]]'''\n{{RecipeIngredientsNB\n| 1 400g can tomatoes\n| 2 tablespoons [[Vegetable oil|vegetable oil]]\n| 250 ml finely chopped [[Onion|onion]] (2 medium onions)\n| 2 [[Fat|fat]] Cloves of [[Garlic|garlic]] peeled and crushed\n| 900 ml [[Chicken stock|chicken stock]] or [[Vegetable Stock|vegetable stock]]\n}}\n\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n* Rinse the [[Rice|rice]] under cold running water\n* Cover with [[Boiling|boiling]] water and leave for 45 minutes\n\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Mexican meatballs ready to simmer.jpg|24 meatballs, ready to simmer\nImage:Mexican meatballs with tortillas.jpg|With tortillas and pasta shells!\nImage:Mexican meatballs with spaghetti.jpg|Mexican meatballs with spaghetti\n</gallery>\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| If the [[Pork|pork]] and [[Beef|beef]] is not very finely [[Minced|minced]], blitz for 10 seconds in a [[Food processor|food processor]] with a metal blade for a fine blend\n| Trim the [[Courgettes|courgettes]] or [[Squash|squash]] and chop very finely\n| Add the chopped [[Squash|squash]], the beaten [[Eggs|eggs]] and the remaining [[Meat|meat]]ball ingredients to the [[Meat|meat]] and mix well with your hands until smooth\n| Make 24 [[Meatballs|meatballs]] (about 4 cm diameter)\n| In a large pan, heat the [[Oil|oil]] and [[Fry|fry]] the [[Onions|onions]] and [[Garlic|garlic]] until softened, about 4 minutes.\n| Briefly pulse the tomatoes in a food processor, you don't want a complete puree. Add the [[Tomatoes|tomatoes]] and bring to a [[Boil|boil]], cook and reduce for 4 minutes, stirring often\n| Add the [[Stock|stock]] to the [[Tomatoes|tomatoes]] and once [[Simmering|simmering]], add the [[Meatballs|meatballs]]\n| Cover the pan and [[Simmer|simmer]] for one hour\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe in bowls with plenty of [[Sauce|sauce]], a [[Chili pepper sauce]] and toasted [[corn tortillas]].\n===Chef's notes===\nFor this dish I used [[pork tenderloin fillet]] pulsed to a fine mince in a food processor fitted with a metal blade.  A fattier cut such as shoulder would probably be better in meatballs, but was not available in the quantity I needed.\n\nI made this over two days in two batches.  The first time I added a few pasta shells in the last 10 minutes and served it with lightly fried [[corn tortillas]].  The second time, with [[spaghetti]].   Both were equally good, though I may opt to thicken the sauce a little next time.\n{{Template:ThinkPig}}\n===Variations===\nUse [[Pumpkin|pumpkin]], [[Butternut squash|butternut squash]] etc instead of the [[Courgettes|courgettes]]. I would think squash may need par boiling for 10 minutes first.\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Beef recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:Mexican recipes]]\n[[Category:Pork recipes]]\n[[Category:Squash recipes]]\n[[Category:Favourite recipes]]\n[[Category:Boiled or simmered]]\n[[Category:Pan fried]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#mexicanmeatballs #courgettes #meatballs #sauce #garlic #eggs #tomatoes #squash #pork #onion #corntortillas </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
