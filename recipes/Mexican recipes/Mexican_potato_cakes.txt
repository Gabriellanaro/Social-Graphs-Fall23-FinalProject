A dusting of [[yellow cornmeal]] makes them easy to roll and a nice finish.\n\nThe mixture kept well for 4 days, refrigerated in a Lock&Lock box and made really nice sized nibbles by rolling into balls (golf-ball sized), pressing in a [[tortilla-press]] then [[shallow-frying]].\n\nIf you don't have a [[tortilla press]], use 2 chopping boards or just two sheets of wood as a substitute.  Place ball of [[dough]] between two non-stick surfaces such as small squares of [[Bake-O-Glide]] and stand on them!\n===Suppliers===\nSee the [[Tortilla Press]] page for UK suppliers.\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Accompaniments]]\n[[Category:Cheese recipes]]\n[[Category:Latin American recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Mexican recipes]]\n[[Category:Potato recipes]]\n[[Category:Snacks and light bites]]\n[[Category:Starters]]\n[[Category:Tex-Mex recipes]]\n[[Category:Favourite recipes]]\n[[Category:Pan fried]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#mexicanpotatocakes #masaharina #pancakes #dough #potatoes #onion #tortillapress #cheese #spicychicken #grilled #miseenplace </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
