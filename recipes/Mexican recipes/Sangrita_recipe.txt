Not to be confused with \"[[sangria]],\" a fruit and wine concoction, this beverage is a tangy mixture of [[tomato]] and [[orange juices]], usually spiked with [[hot chiles]] and [[lime juice]]. It may sound odd in flavour, but sangrita is considered the perfect accompaniment to good quality [[tequila]], like an aged a\u00f1ejo or a good reposado. The [[tequila]] and sangrita are poured into separate [[shot glasses]] and the two are alternately sipped, not chased. First the [[tequila]], then the chilled sangrita. Slowly, one after the other.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 100 ml [[Tomato juice|tomato juice]]\n| [[Juice]] from two large [[Oranges|oranges]]\n| [[Juice]] from one [[Lime|lime]]\n| 1 tablespoon [[Grenadine|grenadine syrup]]\n| 1 small [[Onion|onion]], peeled and very finely chopped\n| 2 [[Serrano chillies|serrano chillies]], finely chopped\n| [[Sea Salt|sea salt]] and [[Ground black pepper|ground black pepper]] to taste\n}}\n'''to garnish'''\n* A few [[Coriander leaves|coriander leaves]]\n\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Blend all of the ingredients in a cocktail [[Mixer|mixer]]\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe chilled, garnished with [[Coriander|coriander]]\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Drink and beverage recipes]]\n[[Category:Mexican recipes]]\n\n[[Category:Uncooked]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#tequila #tomato #sangritarecipe #juice #mixer #serranochillies #limejuice #lime #oranges #onion #hotchiles </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
