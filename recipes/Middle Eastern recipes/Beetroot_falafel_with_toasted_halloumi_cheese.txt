The salty  [[Toasted|toasted]] [[Halloumi cheese|halloumi cheese]] compliments the sweet [[Falafel|falafel]].\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| [[Olive oil]]\n| 1 x 250 g pack of [[Halloumi cheese|halloumi cheese]]\n| 1 medium [[Onions|onion]], peeled and sliced\n| 2 teaspoons [[Cumin seeds|cumin seeds]], ground to a fine powder [[coffee grinder]] or a [[Mortar and pestle|mortar and pestle]]\n| 1 teaspoon of [[coriander seeds]], ground to a fine powder [[coffee grinder]] or a [[Mortar and pestle|mortar and pestle]]\n| 1 teaspoon of [[fenugreek seeds]], ground to a fine powder [[coffee grinder]] or a [[Mortar and pestle|mortar and pestle]]\n| 1 teaspoon of [[chilli powder]]\n| 1 tablespoon of freshly chopped [[parsley]]\n| 1 [[Free range egg|free range egg]]\n| 300 g (10.5 oz) pre cooked (but not pickled) [[Beetroot|beetroot]]. Trimmed, peeled and very roughly chopped\n| 100g (4 oz) [[Breadcrumbs|breadcrumbs]]\n| 2 x 400g cans of [[Chickpeas|chickpeas]] drain and rinsed well under cold running water\n| 1 tablespoon light [[Tahini|tahini]]\n| [[Salt]] and [[Freshly ground black pepper|freshly ground black pepper]]\n}}\n'''to serve'''\n{{RecipeIngredientsNB\n| 300 ml [[Yogurt|yogurt]]\n| 1 tablespoon light [[Tahini|tahini]]\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| Add a tablespoon or so of the [[Olive oil|olive oil]] to a [[Frying pan|frying pan]] and give it a good twist of [[Black pepper|black pepper]].\n| Saut\u00e9 the [[Onions|onions]] over a low heat for about 5 minutes - don't [[Brown|brown]] them.\n| Add the [[Cumin seeds|cumin seeds]] and [[Fry|fry]] for a further minute or so.\n| Allow to cool for a few minutes then add to a [[Food processor|food processor]] with a metal blade.  Don't run until all of the ingredients have been added\n| Add to this; the [[Beetroot|beetroot]], [[Chickpeas|chickpeas]], 1 tablespoon of [[Tahini|tahini]], the [[Breadcrumbs|breadcrumbs]] and the [[Egg|egg]].\n| Blitz to a rough consistency, don't over-[[Blend|blend]]. Aim for some texture, not babyfood.\n| Ideally, leave the mixture to rest for 30 minutes or more before cooking to allow the breadcrumbs to rehydrate a little\n| Using you hands, form into about 20 golf-ball sized balls and them flatten into patties.  A great tip from Jamie Oliver's 15 minutes meals, when moulding [[falafel]]s is to wet your hands first.  This prevents the gooey mixture from sticking to your hands.\n| Gently [[shallow fry]] for 15 to 20 minutes until crusted and caramelised on the outside.  \n| Meanwhile, slice the [[Halloumi|halloumi]] width-wise into about 10 slices, [[Spray|spray]] with [[Olive oil|olive oil]] and [[Griddle|griddle]] until nicely [[Toasted|toasted]] - it won't melt.\n| Mix a tablespoon or so of the [[Tahini|tahini]] into the [[Yogurt|yogurt]], season and mix well to serve as a [[Dip|dip]].\n}}\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Beetroot falafel balls.jpg|Half to cook now, half to freeze\nImage:Beetroot falafel with toasted halloumi cheese_ingredients.jpg|Beetroot falafel mixture, ready to rest\n</gallery>\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe on a bed of [[Green salad|green salad]] with the [[Toasted|toasted]] [[Halloumi|halloumi]], the [[Yogurt|yogurt]] [[Dip|dip]] and warm [[Pitta breads|pitta breads]].\n===Variations===\nThese could also be [[oven baked]] or [[Deep-fried|deep-fried]] until crisped on the outside.\n\nThese could be shaped into balls, laid out on [[greaseproof paper]] over a baking tray, placed in the [[freezer]] then bagged up once completely frozen for later use.  I would be inclined to allow them to completely defrost before cooking, especially if you were to fry them.\n===Chef's notes===\nI did make these with whole spices, but the effect was rather bland so have amended to finely ground spices which should 'spread' the flavour further.\n\nThe falafel pictured were oven baked.  Next time I would flatten them and shallow fry them so the outsides caramelise.  This did not happen with oven baking.\n\nOven directions: Heat [[Oven|oven]] to 200\u00b0 C (400\u00b0 F - gas 6), [fan oven 180\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour], spread out on a baking tray and spray or brush with [[olive oil]] before baking for 3 minutes.\n{{SeeAlso-HalloumiRecipes}}\n* [[Beetroot recipes|Our favourite beetroot recipes]]\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Greek recipes]]\n[[Category:Middle Eastern recipes]]\n[[Category:North African recipes]]\n[[Category:Tunisian recipes]]\n[[Category:Turkish recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Snacks and light bites]]\n[[Category:Tapas, mezze and antipasti]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes]]\n[[Category:Cheese recipes]]\n[[Category:Grain and bean recipes]]\n[[Category:Salad recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegetable recipes]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n[[Category:Grilled, griddled or barbecued]]\n[[Category:Pan fried]]\n[[Category:Favourite recipes]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#beetrootfalafelwithtoastedhalloumicheese #tahini #oliveoil #yogurt #coffeegrinder #mortarandpestle #toasted #beetroot #falafel #breadcrumbs #dip </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
