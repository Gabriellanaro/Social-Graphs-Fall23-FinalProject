It looked delicious.  I have made a few small changes, but it's basically the same as i remember it on television.\n\nThe trick is to slice the [[Liver|liver]] thinly and to cook it quickly.\n\nThis would make a great [[Starter|starter]] or lunchtime [[Snack|snack]].\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| 300g lambs' [[Liver|liver]], any veins removed and very thinly sliced\n| 1 small [[Red onion|red onion]], peeled and thinly sliced\n| 1 teaspoon [[Cumin seeds|cumin seeds]], freshly [[Ground|ground]]\n| 1 teaspoon [[Coriander seeds|coriander seeds]], freshly [[Ground|ground]]\n| 1 teaspoon [[Caraway seeds|caraway seeds]], freshly [[Ground|ground]]\n| 1 [[Clove|clove]] of [[Garlic|garlic]], peeled and thinly sliced\n| Pinch of [[Freshly ground black pepper|freshly ground black pepper]]\n| Pinch of [[Smoked|smoked]] [[Spanish]] [[Paprika|paprika]]\n| Pinch of [[Chilli powder|chilli powder]]\n| Splash of [[Sherry vinegar|sherry vinegar]]\n| 1 teaspoon of [[Olive oil|olive oil]]\n}}\n'''add when [[Frying|frying]]'''\n{{RecipeIngredientsNB\n| 1 teaspoon [[Butter|butter]]\n| Tiny pinch of the above [[Seeds|seeds]], un-[[Ground|ground]]\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| Place all of the ingredients in a [[Lock & Lock]]-style box, close the lid and shake well to combine.\n| Leave for 30 minutes to [[Marinade|marinade]].\n| Heat a pan or a [[Wok|wok]] over a high flame.\n| Add the [[Liver|liver]] mixture to the pan.\n| Add the [[Butter|butter]] and the whole [[Seeds|seeds]] and saut\u00e9 for about 3 or 4 minutes turning regularly to ensure even cooking.\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nWe served this in [[home made pitta breads]] filled with wild [[rocket]] leaves and [[yogurt]].  Can't be beaten!\n===Variations===\nWe couldn't get lambs' [[liver]] today, so went for [[ox]] liver.  As that can be a bit stronger, once it was sliced, I soaked it in milk for 30 minutes which does seem to make it a little milder.\n<gallery widths=270px heights=270px perrow=5>\nImage:Hugh's merguez liver and onions recipe ingredients.jpg|The ingredients: the liver is soaking in milk to make it milder tasting\nImage:Hugh's merguez liver and onions lock and lock box.jpg|Marinating in a lock and lock box\nImage:Hugh's merguez liver and onions frying.jpg|Frying a little at a time\nImage:Hugh's merguez liver and onions serve yourself.jpg|Help yourself\nImage:Hugh's merguez liver and onions recipe.jpg|With wild rocket, yogurt and made-made pitta breads\n</gallery>\n===Recipe source===\n* Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall from River Cottage [[Vegetarian]] TV program [4th February 2013]\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Middle Eastern recipes]]\n[[Category:Moroccan recipes]]\n[[Category:North African recipes]]\n[[Category:Snacks and light bites]]\n[[Category:Starters]]\n[[Category:Tapas, mezze and antipasti]]\n[[Category:Lamb recipes]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:Marinaded]]\n[[Category:Pan fried]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#hughsmerguezliverandonions #ground #liver #butter #rocket #seeds #yogurt #vegetarian #corianderseeds #chillipowder #paprika </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
