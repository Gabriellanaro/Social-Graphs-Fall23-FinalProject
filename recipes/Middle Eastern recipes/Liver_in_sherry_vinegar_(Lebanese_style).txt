Note the huge cinnamon stick!]]\nThe inspiration for this recipe come from a translation of a 1960's Lebanese cook-book I picked up somewhere. I have always found [[Vinegar|vinegar]] a good accompaniment for [[Liver|liver]].  The original recipe just stated [[vinegar]], but I have changed this to [[Sherry vinegar|sherry vinegar]] because I love it so much.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 450 g [[Liver|liver]] ([[Lamb|lamb]] or [[Veal|veal]] preferred)\n| 1 scant teaspoon [[Sea Salt|sea salt]]\n| [[Freshly ground black pepper]]\n| 1 [[Red bell pepper|red bell pepper]], de-seeded and sliced into strips\n| 3 fresh hot [[Chili peppers|chili peppers]], chopped into thin rings and de-seeded if you wish\n| 2.5 cm [[Cinnamon stick|cinnamon stick]], left whole, remove at end of cooking\n| 1 medium [[Onion|onion]], peeled and chopped finely\n| 5 [[Fat|fat]] [[Cloves|cloves]] of [[Garlic]], peeled and crushed mixed with &frac12; teaspoon [[Dried|dried]] [[Mint|mint]]\n| 2 tablespoons [[Flour|flour]]\n| 50 ml [[Sherry vinegar|sherry vinegar]]\n| 50g [[Ghee|ghee]], [[Butter|butter]] or [[Olive oil|olive oil]]\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Wash and clean the [[Liver|liver]] and cut into thin slices.\n| Leave in a [[colander]] for 1 hour to drain excess liquid (if you have the time). Toss in the [[Flour|flour]] to coat\n| Melt the [[Ghee|ghee]] in a pan and [[Fry|fry]] the [[Red pepper|red pepper]] and [[Onions|onions]] until they start to [[Brown|brown]], then add the [[Garlic|garlic]] and [[Mint|mint]]. Just before the garlic starts to colour, tip in the [[Liver|liver]].\n| Add the [[Cinnamon stick|cinnamon stick]] and cook the [[Liver|liver]] for 10 minutes, turning often.\n| Add the [[Salt|salt]], [[Chillies|chillies]] and [[Vinegar|vinegar]], [[Deglaze|deglaze]] the pan, stir well and allow to reduce by a third\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe immediately, with [[cous-cous]] and vegetables.\n===Chef's note===\nThe recipe originally had 100 ml of [[vinegar]] but I found that too much for my taste so reduced it to 50ml.\n===Variations===\nUse [[red wine]] instead of [[vinegar]].\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Lamb recipes]]\n[[Category:Lebanese recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:Middle Eastern recipes]]\n[[Category:North African recipes]]\n[[Category:Offal recipes]]\n[[Category:Veal recipes]]\n[[Category:Pan fried]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#liver #vinegar #cinnamonstick #garlic #mint #flour #ghee #sherryvinegar #lamb #fry #oliveoil </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
