I happened to have a lot of olives when I made this, but you easily reduce the quantity.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 500 g [[Green olives|green olives]], stones intact\n| 1 kg [[Black olives|black olives]], stones intact\n| [[Olive oil]], to cover\n| 1 bulb or more of [[Garlic]], peeled and crushed\n| 1-2 teaspoons [[Chilli powder|chilli powder]]\n| 1 teaspoon [[Cumin seeds|cumin seeds]]\n| 2 tablespoons [[Dried thyme|dried thyme]] or [[Oregano|oregano]]\n| 90 ml [[Sherry vinegar|sherry vinegar]]\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Place the olives in an airtight container, such as a [[Lock&Lock boxes|Lock&Lock box]] and add enough olive oil to cover.\n| Stir in the remaining ingredients and shake vigorously.\n| Leave to [[Marinate|marinate]] for at least a week before consumption.\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nUse with any recipe that calls for [[Olives|olives]], removing the stones if necessary.  Personally, I just enjoy pigging out on them on their own. \n===Variations===\nTry experimenting with your own choice of [[Herbs|herbs]] and [[Spices|spices]].  My green hojiblanca [[Olives|olives]] originated in the area around Fuente de Piedra in Andaluc\u00eda and the black ones were from Syria.  Use any combination of [[Olive|olive]] type, colour and origin.  Make your blend unique!\n===Chef's notes===\nIt is a good idea to shake the container several times daily as the [[Sherry vinegar|sherry vinegar]] sinks to the bottom.\n\nRemove the stones if you wish, but I find that [[Olives|olives]] taste better stoned at the last minute.\n\nDo not throw away the [[Marinade|marinade]] as it can be used as a dressing.\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes|Olives marinated]]\n[[Category:Garlic recipes|Olives marinated]]\n[[Category:Middle Eastern recipes|Olives marinated]]\n[[Category:North African recipes|Olives marinated]]\n[[Category:Pickles and preserves|Olives marinated]]\n[[Category:Snacks and light bites|Olives marinated]]\n[[Category:Spanish recipes|Olives marinated]]\n[[Category:Spicy recipes|Olives marinated]]\n[[Category:Tapas, mezze and antipasti]]\n[[Category:Vegetable recipes|Olives marinated]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes|Olives marinated]]\n[[Category:Vegan recipes]]\n[[Category:Uncooked]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#olives #marinatedolives #sherryvinegar #marinate #greenolives #spices #chillipowder #blackolives #cuminseeds #garlic #olive </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
