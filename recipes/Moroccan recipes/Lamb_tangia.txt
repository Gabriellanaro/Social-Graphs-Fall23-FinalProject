Our version uses a [[Dutch oven|dutch oven]] and a conventional cooker and is quite similar to [[Jamie Oliver's 4 hour slow roast lamb]] but with a bit more [[Spice|spice]].\n\nTraditionally, this dish would use cheap cuts of [[meat]], [[lamb]] [[shank]], shoulder etc. Although the [[Tangia|tangia cooking process]] was originally a peasant's way of cooking, because it transforms simple food into something so exotic, I think it's worth using really good cuts of [[lamb]].  Feel free to ignore me though!\n\nThe aroma that issues from this dish while cooking will stop you in your tracks.  A really complex [[lemon]] scent, the perfume of [[ground coriander]], roasting [[lamb]] and just a tiny hint of [[Garlic|garlic]] and [[onions]] (and I'm not being sarcastic). It is staggering, so please do try to cook this.\n\nEven if you are making this for less than six people, I would still use the same amount of ingredients, but just reduce the meat per person, and maybe a little less [[butter]].\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 200 g lean cuts of [[lamb]] per person (eg leg of [[lamb]] steaks  or 1.8 kg shoulder of [[Lamb|lamb]] cut into 6 sections\n| 1.5 [[Preserved lemons|preserved lemons]], flesh removed\n| 2 large [[Onions|onions]], peeled and quartered\n| 1 tablespoon [[Cumin seeds|cumin seeds]], cracked in a [[Mortar and pestle|mortar and pestle]]\n| 10 peeled [[Garlic|garlic]] cloves\n| 1 tablespoon [[Coriander seeds|coriander seeds]], finely ground in a [[coffee grinder]] or [[Mortar and pestle|mortar and pestle]]\n| Big handful of [[Parsley|parsley]] - big, big, big!\n| 60g [[Butter|butter]]\n| 160 ml water\n| [[Sea Salt|sea salt]] and [[Freshly ground black pepper|freshly ground black pepper]]\n}}\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n* Preheat the [[oven]] to 230\u00b0 C (450\u00b0 F - gas 8)\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Put the water, [[Preserved lemon|preserved lemon]] rinds, [[Garlic|garlic]], [[Onion|onion]], [[Spices|spices]], [[Herbs|herbs]], [[Salt|salt]] and [[Pepper|pepper]] into a [[Food processor|food processor]] and blend to a coarse to medium consistency.\n| I am not a fan of lamb fat/oil so if you are like me, trim off the big hunks of fat.\n| Dab the [[Butter|butter]] over the base of a [[Dutch oven]], lay the [[Meat|meat]] in the bottom, pour the blended [[Sauce|sauce]] over the meat and mix very well\n| Cover the [[Meat|meat]] and [[Sauce|sauce]] with a doubled layer of [[grease-proof paper]], cover the pot with a doubled layer of [[tin foil]] and scrunch up around the rim, then press the lid on so there is a really good seal\n| Place the pot in the middle of the oven, '''immediately reduce the heat to 140\u00b0 C (275\u00b0 F - gas 1)''' and slow cook for 5 hours\n}}\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Slow cooked lamb tangia ready for the oven.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Ready for the oven\nImage:Slow cooked lamb tangia ready to blend.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Ready to blend\n</gallery>\n===Serving suggestions===\nCheck for seasoning and then serve hot with [[boiled potatoes]] or [[plain rice]].\n\nWe had this dish with [[couscous]], but it is such a richly flavoured dish, it needs something quite bland as an accompaniment. The [[Colourful couscous recipe|couscous]] we normally cook also tends to be highly flavoured.  On reflection, I would now serve this with plain [[boiled potatoes]], [[plain boiled rice]] or [[couscous]] cooked in light stock, nothing more.\n\n===Substitutes===\nThe [[preserved lemons]] are the cornerstone of this dish and there really is no alternative (don't attempt to make this with fresh [[lemons]]!). [[Preserved lemons]] are really easy to make yourself but do need a month at least to pickle and improve.  I don't know of a UK supplier, do you? Hey, yes I do - Sainsbury's sell [[preserved lemons]], they are made by [[Belazu]].  Enjoy!  (You will need 2 bought lemons to every 1 homemade lemon)\n\n===Variations===\nThis dish could be cooked in a [[slow cooker]] (crock pot).\n==See also==\n\n* [[Slow roast recipes]]\n\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Garlic recipes]]\n[[Category:Historic recipes]]\n[[Category:Lamb recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:Moroccan recipes]]\n[[Category:North African recipes]]\n[[Category:Stews and casseroles]]\n[[Category:Favourite recipes]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#lamb #lambtangia #preservedlemons #butter #garlic #boiledpotatoes #mortarandpestle #onions #dutchoven #sauce #tangia </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
