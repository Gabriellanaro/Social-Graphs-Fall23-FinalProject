It produces a far superior result to barbecuing, but does take a little longer.\n\nMade with a defrosted frozen half-leg of lamb, this lasted 2 people for 2 days - I used the same [[marinade]] ingredients as for 6 people, but with slightly less [[harissa paste]]. \n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 1 tablespoon of [[coriander seeds]] \n| 1 tablespoon of [[cumin seeds]] \n| 3 tablespoons of Belazu Rose [[Harissa]] - I used 2 tablespoons of homemade [[Orange biter (hot chili sauce)]]\n| juice of 1 [[lemon]] \n| Belazu [[extra virgin olive oil]] \n| 3 cloves of [[Garlic|garlic]] \n| 1.6kg leg of [[lamb]], boned and butterflied (ask your butcher to do this for you)\n| I used a frozen half-leg of lamb and [[butterflied]] it myself.  It was a bit of a fiddle but it worked out fine in the end! \n\n}}\n\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n* Preheat the [[Oven|oven]] to its highest setting; 250\u00b0 C\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Marinaded half-leg of lamb cooked.jpg|After 3 hours in the oven\nImage:Marinaded half-leg of lamb.jpg|Marinaded, ready to cook\nImage:Butterflied half-leg of lamb.jpg|A poorly butterflied leg of lamb\nImage:Half-leg of lamb.jpg|Half-leg of (frozen) lamb, defrosted<br />[\u00a36.50 Morrisons - August 2013]\n</gallery>\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Put the [[Seeds|seeds]] in a [[Pestle and mortar|pestle and mortar]] and crush slightly. \n| Mix the [[Harissa]], [[Lemon|lemon]], 2 tablespoons [[Olive oil|olive oil]], [[Garlic|garlic]] and [[Spices|spices]] together, smear over the [[Lamb|lamb]]\n| [[Marinate|marinate]] for at least three hours. \n| Place on an uncovered grill-tray at the top of the oven on its highest setting.\n| Cook for 15 minutes\n| Reduce the heat to 180\u00b0C [350\u00b0F - Gas 4], place the meat in an oven tray and cover with [[tin-foil]]\n| Cook for 2 hours 30 minutes - check now and then to ensure it is not drying out - reduce the heat if it is.\n| Allow to rest for 10 minutes before carving.\n}}\n(''[[Olive]] magazine'')\n\n===Serving suggestion===\nServe in [[homemade pitta breads]] with a selection of chopped salad vegetables.\n\n===See also===\n* [[Slow-roast recipes]]\n* [[Barbecued Harissa lamb]]\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Lamb recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:Mutton recipes]]\n[[Category:Middle Eastern recipes]]\n[[Category:Moroccan recipes]]\n[[Category:North African recipes]]\n[[Category:Spicy recipes]]\n[[Category:Favourite recipes]]\n[[Category:Stewed, braised or pot roasted]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#lamb #harissa #garlic #slowcookedlegoflambwithharissa #lemon #barbecuedharissalamb #oliveoil #spices #cuminseeds #butterflied #marinate </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
