When you add aromatics to the [[Brine|brine]], the resulting [[Roast|roast]] is also infused with a subtle character all its own\"\n\nI've experimented with a similar recipe using [[Chicken|chicken]] and I have to agree!\n\nAllow 2 days for the preparation and cooking of this festive recipe.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| 3.8 kg whole turkey [8.5 lb] - see Chef's notes\n| 2 tablespoons of (1/2 stick) [[butter]] to coat skin of [[Turkey|turkey]]\n| &#189; gallon of water\n| 2 cups [[Salt|salt]]\n| &#189; cup firmly packed light [[Brown sugar|brown sugar]]\n| 2 tablespoons of [[Peppercorns|peppercorns]]\n| 2 gallons of ice water (50% ice)\n}}\n===Brining===\n\n\n* In 1/2 gallon of water, combine the [[Salt|salt]] and [[Brown sugar|brown sugar]] for the [[Brine|brine]] and bring to a [[Boil|boil]] for about 3 minutes. Remove from heat and add to 5 gallon bucket.\n* Add the remaining ice water.\n* Remove neck, and giblets and the [[Parson's nose]] from [[Turkey|turkey]] and put in 5 gallon bucket. If [[Brine|brine]] won't cover [[Turkey|turkey]] add a little more water.\n* Put bucket in a cold area for 6 to 24 hours.\n\n\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| The tricky thing about cooking [[Poultry|poultry]] is that the dark [[Meat|meat]] needs to be about 15 [[Degrees|degrees]] hotter than the white [[Meat|meat]]. White [[Meat|meat]] is safe to eat at 165\u00b0F (73.9\u00b0C), which is the temperature at which salmonella instantly dies. (Though 12 minutes at 140\u00b0F (60\u00b0C) will kill it as well, so odds are fairly good that, for a [[Roast|roast]], you'll kill it all on the way to 165\u00b0F (73.9\u00b0C)) The problem is that dark [[Meat|meat]] isn't very good at 165\u00b0F (73.9\u00b0C). Further complicating this is that if the breast meat gets to the 180\u00b0F (82.2\u00b0C) that the dark meat wants to be cooked to, it's going to be dry, flavourless, and generally unpleasant.\n| The white [[Meat|meat]] parts of the [[Turkey|turkey]] are the breasts and wings. The dark [[Meat|meat]] are the [[Thighs|thighs]] and [[Drumsticks|drumsticks]]. Now, the wings and drumsticks are going to cook a bit faster than the bits of [[Meat|meat]] that are better attached to the bird. That said, you want the drumsticks cooked more, so don't worry so much about them. The wings, however, are probably worth attaching more firmly to the bird. You can do this by imagining you were twisting someone's arm behind their back. Do this with both wings. Once you figure out the right twist, you'll find that the tips of the wings will stay firmly in place near the centre of the back of the [[Turkey|turkey]] (near its backbone).\n| Preheat the [[Oven|oven]] to 260\u00b0C (500\u00b0F - Gas10 -Extremely hot. (You'll drop the temperature later, but start it hot to get a crispier, more flavourful skin. The effect will be to keep the [[Fat|fat]] from melting and rolling down the side of the [[Turkey|turkey]], which is only going to dry it out.) [[Roast]] at lowest level of the [[Oven|oven]].\n| Place the [[Turkey|turkey]] [[Drumstick|drumstick]] side down on a [[Roasting tray|roasting tray]] (with slots to allow drippings through into a pan), or on a rack sitting in a pan. You will need a [[Basting|basting]] tool to get the drippings from this pan throughout the [[Roasting|roasting]] process.\n| Place the [[Turkey|turkey]] in the [[Oven|oven]].\n| After about 30 minutes, drop the heat to 350 \u00b0F (176.7\u00b0C), remove from [[Oven|oven]] and put a tent of [[Aluminium foil|aluminium foil]] loosely over the breast of the [[Turkey|turkey]]. This is going to keep the breast [[Meat|meat]] from overcooking and [[Drying|drying]] out.\n| For optimum safety and uniform doneness, it is recommended to cook [[Stuffing|stuffing]] outside the bird.\n|The internal temperature should be checked with a [[Food thermometer|food thermometer]] and the breast must reach a minimum of 161 \u00b0F (71.67\u00b0C) before removing it from the [[Oven|oven]]. The [[Thigh|thigh]], ideally, will be around 180\u00b0F (82.2\u00b0C) at this point. It should take about 2 &#190; to 3 hours to reach this temperature, a 14-16 pound bird should require a total of 2 to 2 1/2hours of [[Roasting|roasting]].\n| Let the bird stand 15-20 minutes before carving.\n}}\n===Chef's notes===\nThis recipe will work well with any sized turkey, from  3.8 kg [8.5 lb] to 6.3 kg [14 lb]\n===Recipe source===\n* http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cookbook:Roasted_Brined_Turkey\n==See also==\n* '''[[Meat cooking time calculator Metric|A comprehensive guide to roast meat cooking times]]''' - give the time you want to carve your roast and we'll give you a timed step by step roasting guide\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:North African recipes]]\n[[Category:Historic recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Game recipes]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:Poultry recipes]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n[[Category:Pickled]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#turkey #roast #brine #brownsugar #roasting #americanstylebrinedroastturkey #unusualrecipes #chicken #thigh #poultry #drumsticks </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
