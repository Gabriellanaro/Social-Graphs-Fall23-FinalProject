Add some [[Beans|beans]] for body, [[Peppers|peppers]] for richness and [[Sherry vinegar|sherry vinegar]], just because you can, you have a complete, gorgeous meal. Try it\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 1 400 g can of [[Haricot beans|haricot beans]], rinsed many times and then drained.\n| 2 sweet [[Bell peppers|bell peppers]], any colour.\n| 1 [[Fennel bulb|fennel bulb]], sliced finely, green tops reserved, if you are lucky enough to find a seller that retains them!\n| Half an [[Onion|onion]], very thinly sliced.\n| A small handful of freshly chopped [[oregano leaves]].\n| A large handful of freshly chopped [[parsley leaves]].\n| 1 tablespoon of [[olive oil]]\n| [[Sea salt]] & [[freshly ground black pepper]] to taste.\n| A squeeze of fresh [[lemon juice]].\n| 1 teaspoon [[fennel seeds]], bruised in a [[mortar and pestle]].\n| 3 teaspoons of [[sherry vinegar]].\n\n}}\n\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n* [[Roasted red pepper|Roast the bell peppers as shown here]], remove skin and seeds then tear into strips.\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Place the beans, sliced [[fennel]], [[fennel seeds]] and [[onions]] together with the [[roasted pepper]] strips in a serving bowl.
