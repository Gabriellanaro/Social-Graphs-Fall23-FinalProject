Next to the chickens was a huge whole turkey leg (in two pieces), weighing in at 1.4 kg.  For less than half the price of a [[chicken]].  \n\nUsing the whole [[turkey]] leg, I amended the recipe slightly to my personal tastes. I also added a [[bay leaf]], half a teaspoon of [[turmeric]], a pinch of [[mixed herbs]] and some [[chilli flakes]] at the start, and reduced the [[ground pepper]] to just a good pinch.  I've skinned the legs and cut 6 deep slashes right down to the bone so they cook evenly.  I added 700ml (1.5 pints) of chicken stock, which did not cover the turkey legs, but they will still cook perfectly well, especially if you turn them at the final hour.
