Rayess - 1966 (translated), that I picked up at the second-hand book store in the National Trust cafe at Plas Newydd Country House and Gardens.\n\nThe book is a great reminder of how food was prepared in the past. A great source of inspiration, though I don't think I'll be making this recipe.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| Head of one [[Sheep|sheep]] and eight feet\n| 5 Cloves of [[garlic]] [[Mashed|mashed]] with [[Salt|salt]] and [[Dried|dried]] [[Mint|mint]]\n| 1 tablespoon [[Salt|salt]]\n| 4 oz very sharp [[Vinegar|vinegar]]\n<!--GBR-->\n}}\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Put the head and feet in [[Boiling|boiling]] water for one minute\n| Take out and scrape with a sharp knife until all hair and fuzz is removed\n| Singe head and feet over a low flame turning them all around until all fuzz is burnt\n| Cut the head in two pieces\n| Strike hard on the nose to bring out what is inside it\n| [[Split]] the hooves and remove hair sack and clean all over with cold water\n| Rub it with [[Salt|salt]] and wash with soap and finally rub with [[Rose water|rose water]]\n| Place in a large pot and cover with cold water to which [[Salt|salt]] is added\n| [[Boil]] first over a high heat until scum appears.
