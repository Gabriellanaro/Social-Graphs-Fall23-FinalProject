It is traditionally eaten in Eritrea, Ethiopia, Somalia (where it is also called '''laxoox''' and '''canjeero'''). Although traditionally made from [[teff flour]] it can also be made from [[millet flour]] which will probably be easier to obtain outside of Africa. It is traditionally made using huge [[tavas]], producing table-cloth sized injera that are consumed with the meal.\n\nIt's probably prudent to reduce the scale here and make them using a large [[Frying pan|frying pan]]!\n\n'''Main ingredients'''\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 110 g (4 oz) [[Millet|millet]] [[Flour|flour]]\n| 250 g (2 oz) [[Plain flour|plain flour]]\n| 1 teaspoon [[Dried active yeast|dried active yeast]]\n| [[Salt]]\n| [[Oil]] for [[Frying|frying]]\n\n}}\n\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n* Mix all of the main ingredients together with enough lukewarm water to produce a pourable [[Batter|batter]].\n* Cover with a damp cloth and leave overnight in a warm place to [[Ferment|ferment]]. \n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Stir the [[Fermented|fermented]] [[Batter|batter]] and add [[Salt|salt]] to taste.\n| Heat a very small amount of [[Oil|oil]] on a [[Tava|tava]] or in a [[Frying pan|frying pan]].\n| Pour a small amount of [[Batter|batter]] into the pan and swill it around as you would with normal [[Pancakes|pancakes]].
