Don't puree it to a meat paste!\n| Using about 5 or 6 metal [[skewers]], wrap a good handful of the meat mixture around each skewer.\n| Refrigerate for an hour or two if you can as it will allow the meat to settle and the flavours to mingle.\n| Cook the kebabs on a very hot [[Grill|grill]] or [[Barbecue|barbecue]] for about 4 to 5 minutes, turning now and again.\n| Add the chopped [[Parsley|parsley]] and thinly sliced [[Onion|onion]] to a bowl and squeeze the juice from &#189; a [[Lemon|lemon]] over the [[Onions|onions]]. Add a good pinch of [[Salt|salt]] and toss the mixture well.\n| Warm the [[Tortillas|tortillas]], don't toast them.\n| Season the [[Salad|salad]] leaves with [[Olive|olive]] [[Oil|oil]], the remaining [[Lemon|lemon]] juice and a pinch of [[Salt|salt]].\n| Lay a selection of [[Salad|salad]] leaves on the [[Tortilla|tortilla]], add a dollop of [[Greek yogurt]] and a handful of [[Mint|mint]] and [[Onion|onion]].\n}}\n\nAdd a  pinch of [[chili powder]], [[sea salt]], [[cumin powder]], [[thyme]] leaves and a dash of [[olive oil]] to each kebab as you make them, roll up and serve. I prefer to make them up as I am eating them, but it's your call.\n\n===Chef's note===\nAlthough Jamie put the [[pistachios]] in with the meat, they stayed mainly in one piece (and kept falling off the kebabs), so I would be inclined, next time, to blitz them to small ''rice-sized'' pieces, before adding the meat.\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes|Jamie Oliver's Lamb kebabs]]\n[[Category:Lamb recipes|Jamie Oliver's Lamb kebabs]]\n[[Category:Main courses|Jamie Oliver's Lamb kebabs]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes|Jamie Oliver's Lamb kebabs]]\n[[Category:North African recipes|Jamie Oliver's Lamb kebabs]]\n[[Category:Grilled, griddled or barbecued]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#jamieoliverslambkebabs #lemon #sumac #thyme #foodprocessor #salad #onion #fat #parsley #greekyogurt #cumin </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
