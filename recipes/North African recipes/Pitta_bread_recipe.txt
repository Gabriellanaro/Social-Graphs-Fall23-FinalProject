It can be white (normal flour) or brown when made with [[wholemeal flour]]. \n\nSimilar to other double-layered flat or pocket breads, pita is traditional in many Middle Eastern and Mediterranean cuisines. It is prevalent from North Africa and the Middle East.\n\nThe Indian flatbread form of [[roti]] is sometimes referred to as \"Indian pita\".\n\nWe also have a [[Crispbread|brilliantly simple recipe]] that in a few moments turns normal pitta breads into buttery crispbread. You won't believe how good it is until you try it.\n\nThis recipe is simple and delicious and the results are far better than shop-bought pittas.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| &#190; a teaspoon of [[Dried active yeast|dried active yeast]]\n| 250 g (8.5 oz) strong white flour\n| &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; or 200 g (7 oz) strong [[white flour]] and 50 g (1.5 oz) strong [[Wholemeal flour|wholemeal flour]] for a light wholemeal pitta\n| A pinch of [[ascorbic acid]] or 1 [[vitamin C]] tablet, crushed between 2 tablespoons - (''300mg to 500 mg'') - ''optional''\n| 1 teaspoon [[Sugar|sugar]]\n| &#189; teaspoon [[Salt|salt]]\n| 145 ml water\n\n}}\n===Method===\n\n\n'''Hand method'''\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Mix a little of the water (which should be at body temperature/lukewarm, about 37\u00b0C) with the [[Sugar|sugar]] and the [[Yeast|yeast]], whisk up and leave in a [[warm place]] for 10 minutes to froth up\n| Mix the [[Yeast|yeast]] solution together with the remaining ingredients and [[Kneading bread|knead]] for 10 minutes until you have a pliable [[dough]]\n| Cover with a damp [[Tea|tea]] towel and leave in a [[warm place]] for about an hour to rise\n}}\n\n'''Breadmaker method'''\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Tip all of the ingredients into your [[bread maker]]\n| Set it to the short [[dough]] program (normally the pizza dough setting)\n| Panasonic SD253 breadmaker, use pizza setting.\n| '''[[Panasonic SD-ZB2502 automatic breadmaker]] use menu option 22, pizza dough setting.'''\n| 45 minutes later, proceed as below\n}}\n\n'''Either method - continue from here'''\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Divide into 4 balls [about 100g each] and roll out into oval shapes, about the length of your arm.\n| If you have the time, leave in a [[warm place]] for 30 minutes to rise a little\n| Preheat the [[grill]]\n| Place on a [[Yellow cornmeal|cornmeal dusted]] [[pizza stone]] or lightly oiled [[baking tray]] and [[Bake|bake]] for 5 to 6 minutes, keeping a watchful eye on them.\n}}\n===Chef's tip===\n\nDon't allow these to get too [[Browned|browned]], especially if you are likely to reheat them again before eating.\n\nWe made the batch shown with [[wholemeal flour]] (plus 1/4 of a crushed [[vitamin C]] tablet, for the ascorbic acid needed when using [[wholemeal flour]] in a [[bread maker]])\n\nIf the [[dough]] is a little too wet (or dry), just add a little more [[flour]] (or water) and run it through the [[bread maker]] again. It only takes another 45 minutes and no further involvement on your part.\n\nAlthough this recipe quantity ideally makes 4 pitta breads, you can make 6 mini pittas instead.  They are smaller than pittas we find in the UK, but are great for little snack pockets if filled!\n\n===Arm's length roll out===\nAfter reading The Fabulous Baker Brothers cookbook [ISBN 0755363701, 9780755363704] and following their suggestion to roll the pittas ''the length of your forearm'', that's what I now do.  The pittas generally shrink when they puff up so you get lovely oval pittas.  Thanks guys!\n\n===Variations===\n\nSee the [[Talk:Pitta bread recipe|comments page]] page for variations to this recipe. \n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Accompaniments]]\n[[Category:Bread and baking]]\n[[Category:Breadmaker recipes]]\n[[Category:Middle Eastern recipes]]\n[[Category:North African recipes]]\n[[Category:Snacks and light bites]]\n[[Category:Vegetable recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes]]\n[[Category:Ingredients]]\n[[Category:Prepared foods]]\n[[Category:Vegan recipes]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#wholemealflour #yeast #dough #breadmaker #warmplace #vitaminc #pittabreadrecipe #yellowcornmeal #flour #whiteflour #bakingtray </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
