It's a wonderful warm spicy mix, reminiscent of Arabian cuisine.  I notice that Bart's [[Spices]] now produce one, but I doubt if it'll be as good as Birgit's!\n\nThis recipe is my variation on the [[Ras el hanout chicken (1)|original recipe]], tailored to my taste and using ingredients available at the time. I can't help meddling with recipes!\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 1 tablespoon [[Olive oil|olive oil]]\n| 1 [[Onion|onion]], peeled and chopped\n| 4 cloves of [[Garlic|garlic]] peeled and crushed - or to taste\n| 1 small head of celery, chopped, leaves as well if you have them\n| 2 [[Carrots|carrots]], cut in half lengthways and sliced thickly\n| 1 sweet pepper, any colour, chopped - I only had a half left. \n| 310g skinless [[Chicken|chicken]] breasts, cut into thin strips\n| 3 teaspoons [[Ras el hanout|ras el hanout]]\n| 2 teaspoons of [[ground cumin seeds]] (white)\n| 3 fresh red chillies, chopped\n| 400g can of [[Plum tomatoes|plum tomatoes]], chopped\n| 1 tablespoon tomato puree\n| 300ml hot [[Chicken stock|chicken stock]] (make from a Knorr [[Stock cube|stock cube]] if you wish)\n| 1 410g can of chick peas or [[Beans#Quantities:_dried_beans_vs_cooked_beans_vs_canned_beans|the equivalent amount of dried beans, cooked]]\n| 1 teaspoon of dried parsley if no fresh is available.\n| [[Sea Salt|sea salt]] and [[Freshly ground black pepper|freshly ground black pepper]]\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Heat the [[Oil|oil]] in a large pan or [[Wok|wok]], add a good grind of black pepper to it and then add the [[Carrots|carrots]], [[celery]], [[Onions|onions]] and [[Garlic|garlic]] and [[sweat]] them down for 10 minutes\n| Remove and reserve.\n| Increase the heat, add a little more oil if needed and [[Brown|brown]] the [[Chicken|chicken]] strips for 4 minutes or so\n| Stir in the [[Spice|spices]], mix and continue to heat for a few more minutes\n| Return the previously reserved onion mixture (from point 2) to the pan, add the [[Tomatoes|tomatoes]], [[sweet peppers]], [[parsley]], [[chillies]], [[Chickpeas|chickpeas]] and the [[Stock|stock]]. Season to taste with [[Salt|salt]]\n| Bring to the [[Boil|boil]], reduce the heat and [[Simmer|simmer]], covered for 25 minutes or so.\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe with plain rice of couscous.\n==See also==\n* [[Ras el hanout chicken (1)|Another version of this recipe]].\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes|Chicken]]\n[[Category:Main courses|Chicken]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes|Chicken]]\n[[Category:North African recipes|Chicken]]\n[[Category:Poultry recipes|Chicken]]\n[[Category:Spicy recipes|Chicken]]\n[[Category:Stews and casseroles]]\n[[Category:Stewed, braised or pot roasted]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#raselhanout #garlic #carrots #chicken #parsley #stock #thespiceshop #chickpeas #celery #spices #onions </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
