Caesar Cardini (Italian-born [[Mexican]]) is credited with creating the salad.\n\nContrary to popular belief, the original Caesar's [[Salad|salad]] recipe did not contain pieces of [[Anchovy|anchovy]]; the slight anchovy flavour comes from the [[Worcestershire sauce]]. Cardini was opposed to using [[Anchovies|anchovies]] in his salad.\n\nIn the book From Julia Child's Kitchen, Julia Child describes how she ate a Caesar's [[Salad|salad]] at Cardini's restaurant when she was a child in 1920s, and some 50 years later she sought out and called Cardini's daughter, in order to discover the original recipe. In this recipe, [[Lettuce|lettuce]] leaves are served whole on the plate, because they are meant to be lifted by the stem and eaten with the fingers. It also calls for coddled [[Eggs|eggs]] and Italian [[Olive oil|olive oil]].\n\nRather than re create the absolute original recipe, I have chosen to go for a composite of many current 'favourite' recipes.\n\n\n'''[[Salad]]'''\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 1 small cos [[Lettuce|lettuce]], washed and separated into leaves\n| 1 50 g (2 oz) can of [[Anchovy fillets|anchovy fillets]], drained. Keep 3 back for the dressing as well as the reserved [[Oil|oil]]\n| 40 g (1.5 oz) [[Parmesan cheese]], freshly and finely [[Grated|grated]]\n}}\n'''Dressing'''\n{{RecipeIngredientsNB\n| 1 large [[Egg|egg]]\n| 1 clove of [[Garlic|garlic]], peeled\n| [[Juice]] of 1 [[Lime|lime]] or [[Lemon|lemon]]\n| 1 teaspoon [[English mustard powder]]\n| &frac12; teaspoon [[Worcestershire sauce]]\n| 150 ml [[Olive oil|olive oil]]\n| [[Sea Salt|sea salt]] and [[Freshly ground black pepper|freshly ground black pepper]]\n'''Cro\u00fbtons'''\n| 2 slices of thick white [[Bread|bread]], crusts removed and cut into bite-sized cubes\n| 1 [[Clove garlic, crushed|clove garlic, crushed]]\n| 1 tablespoon [[Olive oil|olive oil]]\n}}\n===Method===\n'''Cro\u00fbtons'''\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Add the [[Olive oil|olive oil]] and [[croutons]] to a [[Frying pan|frying pan]], season with [[Black pepper|black pepper]], start the [[Garlic|garlic]] sizzling then add the cro\u00fbtons. Toss and [[Fry|fry]] until crispy and to taste\n}}\n'''Dressing'''\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Add the [[Egg|egg]], [[Garlic|garlic]] clove, [[Lime juice|lime juice]], [[Mustard powder|mustard powder]], [[Worcestershire sauce]] and the 3 reserved [[Anchovies|anchovies]] and blend until smooth. Gradually drizzle the [[Olive oil|olive oil]] into the [[Blender|blender]] as though you were making mayonaise. As long as you don't rush adding the [[Oil|oil]], you should have a  [[Sauce|sauce]], the consistency of runny [[Salad|salad]]-[[Cream|cream]].\n}}\n'''Final assembly'''\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Finely chop the [[Anchovies|anchovies]]\n| Leaving the leaves whole, but ripping up very big leaves, layer the [[Salad|salad]] leaves and [[Anchovies|anchovies]]\n| Drizzle with the dressing and sprinkle with [[Parmesan]], finishing with the cro\u00fbtons.\n}}\n===Variations===\n*Add a handful of [[Wild rocket leaves|wild rocket leaves]] for a spicier [[Salad|salad]].\n*Add sliced cooked chicken or turkey for a more substantial meal.\n*Leave out the anchovies for a vegetarian version and use a vegetarian [[Worcestershire sauce]] - the original contains anchovies.\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Accompaniments]]\n[[Category:Egg recipes]]\n[[Category:Historic recipes]]\n[[Category:Salad recipes]]\n[[Category:Starters]]\n[[Category:North American recipes]]\n[[Category:Tex-Mex recipes]]\n[[Category:Pan fried]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#salad #oliveoil #worcestershiresauce #caesarsalad #anchovies #lettuce #egg #garlic #blackpepper #parmesancheese #croutons </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
