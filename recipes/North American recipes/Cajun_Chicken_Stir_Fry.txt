That sounds weird, but I bet it will be fine.  I marinaded the chicken slices in lime juice for an hour, then added the Cajun Seasoning and a tablespoon of olive oil to a Lock and Lock box, closed the lid and shook for ten seconds.  This leaves the chicken perfectly coated.  It could be stir fried on a wok but I'm going to air fry it in the basket so it can be cooked with no extra oil.\n\nI've used the remains of the Morrisons pre-packed [[Stir-fry|stir-fry]] ingredients from yesterday's [[Chilli and lime chicken stir fry]].\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| 1 large [[Chicken breast|chicken breast]], cut into thin strips\n| 2 tablespoons of [[lime juice]]\n| 1 heaped tablespoon of [[Taste Sensation Cajun Seasoning]]\n| 3 tablespoon [[Olive oil|olive oil]]\n| Half a packet of [[Bean sprouts|bean sprouts]] [180 g]\n| Half a packet of fresh [[Egg noodles|egg noodles]] [205 g]\n| Half a packet of Sweet & Crunchy [[Stir fry|stir fry]] [300 g]\n}}\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n\n* If you get the chance, marinade the chicken pieces in lime juice for an hour before you add the Cajun Seasoning\n\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| Pop the sliced [[Chicken|chicken]] in a [[Lock and Lock box|lock and lock box]] together with the [[Taste Sensation Cajun Seasoning]] and one of the tablespoons of [[Olive oil|olive oil]].
