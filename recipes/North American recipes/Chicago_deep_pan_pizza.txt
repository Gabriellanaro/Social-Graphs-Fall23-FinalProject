For me though, the essential deep pan Chicago pizza comes not from Tortuga's but from Bob M. Payton's 300 seat 'Chicago Pizza Pie Factory', deep-down in the basement, in a corner of London's Hanover Square.  It would have been in 1980-something, when mobile phones were the size of car batteries and the Internet was unknown.\n\nIn those days the queues would reach all the way down the stairs to a 'boxing-ring', where you would stand and take your pre-meal drinks.  The Chicago Pizza Pie Factory was a forerunner of Hard-Rock style themed restaurants. Loud rock music played and big screens showed American sports. The decor of the place was authentic Chicago Americana and the food was fantastic with super-slick service that used a really clever idea - A flashing neon sign: 'My Kinda Town'. The flickering letter would indicate to the waitresses which table area of the huge restaurant had food ready to be served.\n\nBob died in the mid 90's and I believe the restaurant closed around that time too.  I notice that a restaurant of the same name exists in Dublin.  I would be interested to see if it bears any resemblance to the original.\n\nThis was absolutely fantastic and nothing like as difficult as you might think.  Thanks for the inspiration Julia - I believe you can!\n===How to ensure a crispy base===\nHaving made these deep pan pizzas many, many times, I've found that sometimes it's hard to get the base well cooked without burning the rest of the [[pizza dough]].  I've found the best way is to use a metal-based pan, similar to a baking tray.  The metal base gets hot enough to crisp the base properly.  I have a cast iron  rectangular Le Creuset baking tray that is absolutely ideal.  It seems a shame as it will mean I'll never use my earthenware deep pan pizza dish again!\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Cooking the chorizo sausage.jpg\nImage:Chicago chorizo pie pizza cheese.jpg\nImage:Chicago chorizo pie pizza filled.jpg\nImage:Chicago chorizo pie pizza topping.jpg\nImage:Chicago pizza pie ready to bake.jpg\nImage:Chicago pizza pie baked.jpg\n</gallery>\n[[Image:ChickenDeepPanPizza.jpg|300px|thumb|right|A chicken and sweetcorn deep pan pizza version, cooked in a Le Creuset pan]]\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| The sausage-meat removed from 400g of uncooked [[Chorizo]] style [[sausages]] - ''these are not cured so need to be pre cooked''\n| 1 small [[Onion|onion]], chopped finely\n| 1 portion of [[Pizza dough|pizza dough]]\n| [[Fine yellow cornmeal]] for dusting\n| 110 g (4 oz) [[Cheddar cheese]], [[Grated|grated]]\n| A big handful of fresh [[Mushrooms|mushrooms]], brushed and sliced\n| 85 g (3.5 oz) freshly [[Grated|grated]] [[Parmesan cheese]]\n| 1 large can of chopped peeled [[Tomatoes|tomatoes]], left to drain over a coarse sieve for 5 minutes\n| 1 tablespoon [[Dried|dried]] [[Garlic powder|garlic powder]]\n| 1 teaspoon [[Dried|dried]] [[Mexican oregano]]\n| 1 teaspoon [[Dried|dried]] [[Parsley|parsley]]\n| Pinch of [[Mixed herbs|mixed herbs]]\n| 1 teaspoon [[Chilli flakes|chilli flakes]] (Guajillo - not too hot)\n| Pinch of [[Black pepper|black pepper]]\n| 1 ball of [[Buffalo|buffalo]] [[Mozzarella|mozzarella]], torn\n\n}}\n\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n\n* Preheat the [[Oven|oven]] to 190\u00b0 C (375\u00b0 F - gas 5), [fan oven 170\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins]\n* Remove the sausagemeat from the sausages and discard the skins\n* Make the [[pizza dough]] as instructed\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| Saut\u00e9 the [[onions]], [[Mushrooms|mushrooms]] and the chorizo sausagemeat in a pan for for about 10 minutes or until the meat is cooked and any liquid has evapourated.

Just ensure the mixture is not too wet before you bake the pizza.\n==See also==\n* www.ibelieveicanfry.com/2012/01/chicago-stuffed-pizza.html Julia's Chicago pizza recipe\n* [[:Category:I believe I can fry recipes|Julia's recipes on Cookipedia]]\n* [http://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/16/obituaries/bob-payton-50-restaurateur-dies.html Bob Payton's obituary (N.Y.
