It typically consists primarily of a strongly-flavoured [[stock]], [[meat]] or [[shellfish]], a thickener, and seasoning vegetables, which can include [[celery]], [[bell peppers]] and [[onions]] (a trio known in Cajun cuisine as the \"holy trinity\"). Gumbo is often categorised by the type of thickener used: the African vegetable [[okra]], the Choctaw spice fil\u00e9 powder (dried and ground [[sassafras  leaves]]), or roux, the French base made of flour and fat.\n\nThis version added by [[User:\u200eDoug Sabulsky|\u200eDoug Sabulsky]] is [[Chicken]] and [[Sausage]] [[Gumbo]]\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| 1 cup [[Peanut oil|peanut oil]] \n| 1.5 cups [[Flour|flour]]\n| 2 large [[Onions|onions]], chopped\n| 2 [[Bell peppers|bell peppers]], chopped\n| 4 [[Ribs|ribs]] [[Celery|celery]], chopped\n| 1.5 cups [[Frozen|frozen]] sliced [[Okra|okra]]\n| 4 quarts [[Chicken_stock_(1)|Chicken stock]]\n| 2 [[Bay leaves|bay leaves]]\n| 2 teaspoons [[Creole seasoning]], or to taste\n| 1 teaspoon [[Dried|dried]] [[Thyme leaves|thyme leaves]]\n| [[Salt]] and [[Freshly ground black pepper|freshly ground black pepper]] to taste\n| 1360 g [3 pounds] [[Chicken thighs|chicken thighs]]\n| 907 g [2 pounds] Andouille [[Sausage|sausage]], cut into 1/2\" pieces\n| 2 cups cut [[Frozen|frozen]] [[Okra|okra]]\n\n}}\n\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n\nPreheat the [[Oven|oven]] to 175\u00b0 C (350\u00b0 F - gas 2), [fan [[Oven|oven]] 150\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n}}\n''' Method for [[Gumbo]]'''\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Season the [[Chicken|chicken]] with [[Salt|salt]], [[Pepper|pepper]] and [[Creole seasoning]], cover and [[Rest for|rest for]] two hours in the [[Refrigerator|refrigerator]].
