Loris, South Carolina celebrates an annual festival called the \"Loris Bog-Off\". \n\nChicken bog is made in different ways in different places, but it is perhaps found most often in the Pee Dee and Low country regions of South Carolina.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 1 very large whole [[Chicken|chicken]] 2.2kg to 2.7 kg (5lb to 6 lb)\n| 1 medium [[Onion|onion]]\n| 1 green [[Sweet pepper|sweet pepper]]\n| 110g (4 oz) [[Butter|butter]]\n| 900 g (2 lb) long [[Grain|grain]] [[White rice|white rice]] ([[Basmati rice|basmati rice]] is good)\n| 110g (4 oz) [[Bacon|bacon]]\n| 6 cups (1.5 litres / 2.6 pints) [[chicken stock]] / chicken broth\n| [[Sea Salt|sea salt]] and [[Freshly ground black pepper|freshly ground black pepper]]\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| [[Parson's nose|Remove the parson's nose]] from the chicken.\n| Use a heavy pot with lid (use lid while cooking for all steps except the [[Bacon|bacon]].)\n| Put [[Chicken|chicken]] in pot and cover with hot water. Be sure there is enough water so that there will be at least six cups of [[Broth|broth]] after cooking chicken. \n| Bring to a [[Boil|boil]], then reduce heat and [[Simmer|simmer]] until chicken is very tender (an hour or more).\n| While the [[Chicken|chicken]] is cooking: Slice and chop one [[Bell pepper|bell pepper]] into very small pieces. Put 4 cups of [[Rice|rice]] into a bowl, cover with cold water and let soak.\n| When [[Chicken|chicken]] is very tender, remove pot from stove and let cool until the chicken can be handled.\n| Take [[Chicken|chicken]] from pot, and pull [[Meat|meat]] from [[bones]] in large pieces; do not cut it up. Discard any [[Fat|fat]] heavy skin.\n| Pour [[Broth|broth]] from pot into a bowl (if [[Chicken|chicken]] was very [[Fat|fat]] and broth is very fat, pour off about 1 cup of fat from broth).\n| Wash pot, then put [[Bacon|bacon]] in pot and cook slowly until bacon is crisp.\n| Take [[Bacon|bacon]] from pot and drain; leave bacon grease in pot.\n| Put in chopped [[Onion|onion]], [[Green pepper|green pepper]] and [[Brown|brown]] slightly.\n| Add 6 cups [[Chicken|chicken]] [[Broth|broth]] to pot, and season to taste with [[Salt|salt]] and [[Pepper|pepper]] (at least a tablespoon of each -- use a heavy [[Hand|hand]] since [[Rice|rice]] will absorb salt).\n| Increase heat, bring [[Broth|broth]] to a [[Boil|boil]], and put [[Chicken|chicken]] in pot.\n| Drain [[Rice|rice]] and put rice in pot.\n| Add the [[Butter|butter]] and mix well. Reduce heat and [[Simmer|simmer]] very slowly for about an hour.\n}}\n===Variations===\nUse 225 g (8 oz) of [[spicy sausages]] or [[smoked sausages]] instead of the [[bacon]].\n==See also==\n* {{See also - Jointing a chicken}}\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Historic recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:North American recipes]]\n[[Category:Poultry recipes]]\n[[Category:Boiled or simmered]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#chicken #bacon #chickenbogrecipe #broth #rice #butter #simmer #onion #boil #fat #spices </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
