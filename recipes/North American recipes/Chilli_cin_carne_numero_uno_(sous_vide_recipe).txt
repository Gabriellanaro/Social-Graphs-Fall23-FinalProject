This recipe is not cooked [[sous-vide]] in the way you would normally.  I don't have a 6 litre sous-vide cooker, I've used my [[home-made sous-vide cooker]] and instead of cooking in a vacuum sealed bag, I've just used the slow cooker with scrunched up baco-foil to provide a better seal.  This could be simply replicated in a slow cooker that has a very accurate temperature setting, should such a thing exist outside of my house!\n\nIf you are luck enough to have a sous-vide cooker that can accomodate 6 litres I would be inclined to premix everything in a bowl first and vacuum seal but manually seal the container before liquid is drawn into the [[vacuum sealer]]. \n\nThe recipe is very similar to the original , The Manhattan Chili Co's famous \u200e[[Chili con carne numero uno]].  The main differences are that I've used [[leeks]] instead of onions and altered the cooking method .\n\n''This was not very successful - the prolonged cooking time make the oregano and cinnamon far too strong - stick to the [[Chili con carne numero uno|original]] - it's far better!''\n\n''1 cup in this recipe represents 237 ml''\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| &#188; cup of [[Olive oil|olive oil]]\n| Freshly [[ground black pepper]]\n| 4 large [[leeks]], trimmed and chopped (4 cups)\n| 500 g (1 lb 2 oz) [[Minced beef|minced beef]] (''[[Ground beef|ground beef]]'')\n| 500 g (1lb 2 oz) [[Minced|minced]] [[Pork|pork]] (''[[Ground|ground]] pork'')\n| 2 teaspoons [[Sea Salt|sea salt]]\n| 4 heaped tablespoons of unsmoked [[paprika powder]]\n| 2 scant fresh [[Cumin seeds|cumin seeds]], [[Toasted|toasted]] and [[Ground|ground]] to a powder in a [[Coffee grinder|coffee grinder]]\n| 2 scant tablespoons [[Dried|dried]] [[Mexican oregano]]\n| 2 tablespoons unsweetened [[Cocoa powder|cocoa powder]] (Green & Black's or similar quality product)\n| 1 large whole stick of [[cinnamon]] bark to be removed and discarded after cooking\n| 1.5 teaspoons of [[Exotic chilli powders|ancho chilli powder]]\n| 2 teaspoons of [[Exotic chilli powders|chilli chipotle flakes]]\n| Good shake of [[Louisiana hot pepper sauce]]\n| Good shake of [[lime juice]]\n| 4 cups [[Passata]] (tomato)\n| 3 cups [[Beef Stock|beef stock]]\n| 8 [[Garlic cloves, peeled and crushed|garlic cloves, peeled and crushed]]\n| 1 to 3 tablespoons of coarse [[Yellow cornmeal|yellow cornmeal]] for thickening\n| 2 cans [[Red kidney beans|red kidney beans]], drained\n}}\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Chili con carne numero uno and rice.jpg|Chili con carne numero uno, [[homemade tortilla chips]], [[plain rice]], [[soured cream]] and [[orange]] slices\nImage:Chili con carne numero uno sous-vide.jpg|Home-made sous-vide cooker (and sous-vide ''bag''!)\nImage:The Manhattan chili co ingredients.jpg|Chili con carne numero uno, the ingredients\nImage:Manhattan Chili Co - Goodbye.jpg|The Manhattan Chili Co is now closed.\n</gallery>\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| In a [[Wok|wok]] or large [[Frying pan|frying pan]], heat the [[Oil|oil]] and add a grind of black pepper then gently cook the [[leeks]] for 20 minutes until soft - don't brown them.\n| Meantime, in a separate pan, add a small amount of the [[Oil|oil]] from the [[Onions|onions]], just to prevent the [[Meat|meat]] from sticking and add the [[Pork|pork]], [[Beef|beef]] and [[salt]].
