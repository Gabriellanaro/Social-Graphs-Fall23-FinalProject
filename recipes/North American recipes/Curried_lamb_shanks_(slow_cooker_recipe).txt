Southwest American Cookbook.  I have amended it to use a [[slow cooker]] and for once, used commercial [[curry powder]] rather than a homemade blend.\n\n===Update===\nThe ingredients shown below have been much reduced from the original recipe because, to my taste, it was almost bitter.  To rescue the meal, I discarded all of the original gravy and served it with potatoes, carrots, peas and a normal [[onion gravy]].  It still had a little of the curry bite so was not a complete disaster. The lamb shanks were perfectly cooked and delicious.\n\nIf you do make this, taste the gravy and adjust the seasoning before the extended cooking period.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| 100 ml [[olive oil]]\n| 2 [[Lamb shanks|lamb shanks]]\n| [[Sea Salt|sea salt]] & [[Freshly ground black pepper|freshly ground black pepper]]\n| 2 [[Onions|onions]], peeled and sliced\n| 1 bulb of [[Garlic, peeled and crushed|garlic, peeled and crushed]]\n| 2 teaspoons of [[curry powder]]\n| 1 teaspoon [[Cumin seeds|cumin seeds]], lightly [[Toasted|toasted]] and finely [[Ground|ground]]\n| 1 teaspoon of [[Dried|dried]] [[Mexican oregano]]\n| 1 tablespoon [[muscovado sugar]]\n| 1 tin peeled [[Plum tomatoes|plum tomatoes]]\n| 330 ml [[Guinness]] (1 bottle)\n| 100 ml [[Beef Stock|beef stock]]\n| ''optional'' - 2 teaspoons [[Exotic chilli powders|mild chilli powder]] (''guajillo'')\n}}\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Curried lamb shanks.jpg|300px|thumb|right|After 4 hours slow cooking\nImage:Manhattan Chili Co - Goodbye.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The Manhattan Chili Co is now closed.\n</gallery>\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| In a large flameproof [[Casserole|casserole]] or [[Dutch Oven|dutch oven]], heat 100 ml of [[olive oil]], when hot add a good pinch of [[Black pepper|black pepper]] and  [[Brown|brown]] the [[Lamb shank|lamb shank]] really well on all sides, this should take around 15 minutes.\n| Sprinkle the [[Lamb shanks|lamb shanks]] with a pinch of [[Salt|salt]] and pop them in the [[slow cooker]].
