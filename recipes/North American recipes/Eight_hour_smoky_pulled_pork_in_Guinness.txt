It's also great in sandwiches\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 2.2kg [[Pork shoulder]] joint\n| 100 ml [[Olive oil|olive oil]]\n| 100 ml [[Worcestershire sauce]]\n| 30g [[Smoked paprika|smoked paprika]] or a mixture of normal and [[Smoked|smoked]] [[Paprika|paprika]]\n| 1 bunch of [[Thyme|thyme]]\n| A few [[Bay leaves|bay leaves]]\n| 300 ml of Guinness original (small bottle)\n| 1 bulb of [[Garlic]], peeled and crushed\n| [[Juice]] and [[Zest|zest]] from 1 [[Lemon|lemon]]\n| A tablespoon of [[Muscovado sugar|muscovado sugar]]\n| [[Sea Salt|sea salt]] and [[Freshly ground black pepper|freshly ground black pepper]]\n\n}}\n\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n*Cut a criss-cross of slashes in the skin with a very sharp knife such as a Stanley knife.  The skin won't go crispy but it helps to keep the [[Meat|meat]] moist and the slashes let the [[Marinade|marinade]] through. I normally leave the lemon skins in while it marinades and also whilst it cooks.\n*Place the joint in a large tray, pour the [[Marinade|marinade]] over and [[Refrigerate|refrigerate]] overnight, '[[Basting|basting]]' now and then.\n*Preheat the [[Oven|oven]] to maximum heat\n*Mix all of the ingredients together and\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Cover the [[Roasting tray|roasting tray]] with [[Tin-foil|tin-foil]], sealing the edges.  Ensure that the roasting tray is very well sealed or the joint is likely to dry out after 8 hours cooking. #<small>see [[Talk:Eight hour smoky pulled pork in Guinness|talk page]]</small>\n| Place in the [[Oven|oven]] and immediately turn the heat down to 140\u00b0 C (257\u00b0 F - gas 1)\n| Cook for 8 hours\n| Decant the joint to another [[Roasting tray|roasting tray]], shred whatever [[Meat|meat]] you are going to consume immediately, store the remaining [[Meat|meat]] in a [[Lock and Lock]] style box and refrigerate for later use. This way it will stays moist and fresh.\n| Using a [[Fat strainer|fat strainer]] separate most of the excess fat from the cooking juices and discard. Add the cooking juices back to the roasting tray and heat up over the hob. Mix in the [[Shredded|shredded]] [[Meat|meat]], stir well to mix then transfer to a serving dish.\n}}\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Eight hour smoky Guinness pulled pork_overnight.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Ready to refrigerate overnight\nImage:Eight hour smoky Guinness pulled pork_ingredients.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Eight hour smoky Guinness pulled pork, the ingredients\n</gallery>\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe with [[Pitta bread|pitta bread]], [[Pickles|pickles]] and [[Cole slaw|cole slaw]].\n===Chef's notes===\nA can of drained [[kidney beans]] or virtually any pulses added at the start of the cooking process make this recipe stretch even firther.\n{{Template:See-also-pulled-pork}}\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Irish recipes]]\n[[Category:North American recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:Pork recipes]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#eighthoursmokypulledporkinguinness #roastingtray #pittabread #porkshoulder #marinade #coleslaw #muscovadosugar #marinading #bayleaves #juice #garlic </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
