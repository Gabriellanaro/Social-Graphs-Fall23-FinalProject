By all means '''[[Meatballs|make your own]]''' if you feel so inclined.\n\nUse a [[Pizza stone|pizza stone]]!  It makes such a difference.  Your [[Pizzas|pizzas]] will go from those soggy-based shop bought shockers, to [[Pizza]] Express perfection in one simple step!\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 1 portion [[Pizza dough|pizza dough]]\n| 300 g pack of cooked [[Meatballs|meatballs]] of your choice\n| 150 g pack of [[Mozzarella cheese|mozzarella cheese]]\n| large can [[Tomatoes|tomatoes]], chopped.\n| A good glug of [[Olive oil|olive oil]]\n| 1 [[Onion|onion]], peeled and sliced\n| 2 [[Cloves garlic, crushed|cloves garlic, crushed]]\n| 1 [[Dried|dried]] [[Chile de Arbole|chile de arbole]], [[Ground|ground]] to powder in a [[Coffee grinder|coffee grinder]] or [[Pestle and mortar|pestle and mortar]] (or &frac12; teaspoon [[Chili powder|chili powder]])\n| 125 ml [[Red wine|red wine]]\n| A pinch of [[Sugar|sugar]]\n| [[Sea Salt|sea salt]] and [[Freshly ground black pepper|freshly ground black pepper]]\n| [[Fine yellow cornmeal]] for dusting\n\n}}\n\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n* Make the [[Pizza dough|pizza dough]] as instructed\n* If using a [[pizza stone]], preheat the [[pizza stone]] under a very hot [[grill]] for about 20 minutes.  Place it about 8cm (3\") from the heat source.\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Meatball pizza ready for the oven.jpg|Ready for the oven\nImage:Meatball pizza stone baked.jpg|One done, one waiting\nImage:Meatball pizza tomato sauce.jpg|Tomato sauce reduced\n</gallery>\n===Method===\n'''Meatball [[Sauce|sauce]]'''\n{{RecipeMethod\n| [[Fry]] the [[Onions|onions]] and [[Garlic|garlic]] in a few glugs of [[Olive oil|olive oil]] seasoned with [[Black pepper|black pepper]] until soft, about 10 minutes.\n| Add the [[Meatballs|meatballs]], [[Tomatoes|tomatoes]], [[Red wine|red wine]], [[Chili|chili]] and [[Simmer|simmer]] until reduced and very thick - you don't want a wet [[Pizza|pizza]].\n| As I have plenty of time on [[Pizza|pizza]] day (Friday!) I make the [[Sauce|sauce]] early in the afternoon and put it on the heat for 5 minute batches every hour or so, leaving it uncovered to 'dry-out' in between. You can of course just [[Simmer|simmer]] to reduce, but you need to watch it and keep stirring all the time.\n| Season to taste\n}}\n'''Putting it together'''\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Preheat the [[Grill|grill]] to high as you can get it\n| Set the [[Pizza stone|pizza stone]] about 8 cm (3\") below the heat source or the [[Pizza|pizza]] may burn\n| Dust the work surface with [[yellow cornmeal]] and then stretch or roll the [[Dough|dough]] into two thin rounds\n| Prick the pizza all over with a fork. This prevents it puffing up too much and burning while it is cooking\n| [[Grill]] the [[Pizza|pizza]] for about 2 minutes on one side only or until browned.\n| Remove from the oven, flip over and ad the topping.\n| Divide the [[Meatballs|meatballs]] and [[Sauce|sauce]] between the two [[Pizzas|pizzas]], cut the meatballs in half and spread over the [[Pizza|pizza]]\n| Cover with sliced [[Mozzarella cheese|mozzarella cheese]], drizzle with a little [[Olive oil|olive oil]] and [[Bake|bake]] for for 3 to 5 minutes (depending on how hot your [[Oven|oven]] is) or until the [[Cheese|cheese]] browns a little.  Watch it carefully as it's easy to burn at such a high heat.\n| Serve!\n}}\n===Chef's notes===\nLots of supermarkets do chopped tomatoes, flavoured with [[Chili|chili]]/[[Basil|basil]]/[[Oregano|oregano]] etc, and though it's as easy to do this yourself, they are quite handy for [[Pizza|pizza]] toppings.\n\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Bread and baking]]\n[[Category:Cheese recipes]]\n[[Category:Italian recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Pizza recipes]]\n[[Category:North American recipes]]\n[[Category:Snacks and light bites]][[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#pizza #meatballpizza #meatballs #sauce #pizzastone #grill #pizzas #oliveoil #mozzarellacheese #chili #redwine </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
