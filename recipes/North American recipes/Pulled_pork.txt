I prefer to leave chemicals like that in the garage!  However, if you have your own [[Smoking food|smoker]], I would smoke it for an hour or so before you start the cooking process.\n\nIf you like this, you will also love the selection of pulled pork recipes at the bottom of this page.\n\nNote: This recipe needs to be prepared 24 hours in advance.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 1.3 kg (3 lb) boneless [[pork shoulder]].\n| 2 level teaspoons [[Sea Salt|sea salt]]\n| 3 tablespoons [[Brown sugar|brown sugar]]\n| 2 tablespoons [[Paprika|paprika]] - [[smoked paprika]] if you have it.\n| 1 teaspoon [[Cinnamon|cinnamon]] powder, freshly ground if possible - see ''Chef's notes''\n| 2 teaspoons [[Mustard powder|mustard powder]]\n| 1/2 a teaspoon [[Peppercorns|peppercorns]], [[Ground|ground]] to a powder in a [[Coffee grinder|coffee grinder]]\n| 2 teaspoons [[Chilli powder|chilli powder]] or a bunch of your favourite [[Dried|dried]] [[Chillies|chillies]], powdered\n| 2 teaspoons [[coriander seeds]], [[Ground|ground]] to a powder\n| 2 teaspoons [[Garlic powder|garlic powder]]\n| 1 teaspoon [[Ginger powder|ginger powder]] \n}}\n'''Cook it over:'''\n* 450 ml [[Cider|cider]]\n'''The reduction'''\n* 1 tablespoon [[Brown sugar|brown sugar]]\n* [[White wine vinegar]] to taste\n\n\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n* Preheat the [[Oven|oven]] to 150\u00b0 C (300\u00b0 F - gas 2)\n*If you are lucky enough to have a [[Smoking food|smoker]], smoke the joint for an hour or so.\n*Mix all of the [[Spices|spices]] together in a large [[baking tray]].\n*Slice the skin off the joint - we're not going to use it today.\n*Make random slashes all over the [[Meat|meat]].\n*Rub the [[Spice|spice]] mix all over the [[Pork|pork]] and into the cuts you've made.\n*Cover and [[Refrigerate|refrigerate]] for 24 hours.\n* 15 minutes before you are ready to start cooking, preheat the [[Oven|oven]] to 150\u00b0 C (300\u00b0 F - gas 2)\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Pulled pork on cider.jpg|thumb|300px|right|24 hours later, sitting over the cider, ready for the oven\nImage:Spice mix for pulled pork.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Spice mix for pulled pork\n</gallery>\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Place the [[Pork|pork]], 'skin-side-up' on a wire rack resting on a tray full of [[Cider|cider]].  The pork must be clear of the cooking liquor.\n| Cover and seal with two layers of [[Tin-foil|tin-foil]] so the joint can [[Steam|steam]] in the [[Cider|cider]].\n| Cook for 4.5 hours, and don't fiddle or mess about with it!\n| After 4.5 hours, turn the heat up to 200\u00b0 C (400\u00b0 F - gas 6).\n| Reserving the original tray and its juices, place the joint on its rack over a clean, dry [[roasting tray]] and [[Roast|roast]] uncovered for a further 30 minutes.\n| When the [[Pork|pork]] is cooked, use two forks to shred the pork into tiny pieces.\n| To the juices, add the final [[Sugar|sugar]], taste, and then add a splash or so of [[white wine vinegar]] to balance the flavours. Use a wooden spatula to get all of the goodness from the pan and then whisk well.\n| Tip the [[Pork|pork]] into the [[Sauce|sauce]] and heat until it is reduced to a sticky mass.\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe on [[Toasted|toasted]] buns with [[cole-slaw]] and buttery [[Corn on the cob|corn on the cob]].\n\n===Chef's notes===\nThe spices in this are not an exact science. If you don't have a certain spice, use something else.  Look at the individual spice links on this page or our main [[:Category:Spices|spice category]] to find similar spices that you may have instead.  If you favour a certain flavour, add more of it. Mess around, be bold!!\n\nHaving made this five or six times now, I would be inclined to leave out the [[cinnamon]] as I find the flavour somewhat overpowering.  However, it does seems to be included in most traditional recipes.\n\nI have also started to coat the pork with a good splash of [[lime]] or [[lemon juice]] before I add the rub.\n{{RecipeLine}}\n{{Template:See-also-pulled-pork}}\n[[Category:Smoked]]\n[[Category:Smoker recipes]]\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Cooking with beer]]\n[[Category:Chilli pepper recipes]]\n[[Category:Barbecue recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:Pork recipes]]\n[[Category:North American recipes]]\n[[Category:Spicy recipes]]\n[[Category:Favourite recipes]]\n[[Category:Marinaded]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#pulledpork #pork #cider #cinnamon #ground #whitewinevinegar #smokingfood #brownsugar #lemonjuice #chillipowder #gingerpowder </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
