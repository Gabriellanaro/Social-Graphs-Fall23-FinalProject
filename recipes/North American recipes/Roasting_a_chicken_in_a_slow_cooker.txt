You can invent your own, all you need is a little imagination.  At the very least, you should rub the skin with [[Olive oil|olive oil]] and a little [[Salt|salt]] and [[Pepper|pepper]].\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| 1 whole raw [[Chicken|chicken]] - if it has been [[Frozen|frozen]], ensure that it is completely [[Defrosted|defrosted]].\n| 1 [[Onion|onion]], un peeled, cut into quarters\n| A few sprigs of [[Fresh herbs|fresh herbs]] of choice (if available)\n| 2 tablespoons of [[Olive oil|olive oil]]\n}}\n'''rub'''\n{{RecipeIngredientsNB\n| 1 teaspoon [[Garlic powder|garlic powder]]\n| 1 teaspoon fine [[Salt|salt]]\n| 1 teaspoon [[Freshly ground black pepper|freshly ground black pepper]]\n| 1 teaspoon [[Paprika powder|paprika powder]]\n| &#189; teaspoon [[chilli powder]] \n| &#189; teaspoon [[Smoked paprika powder|smoked paprika powder]] (optional)\n| 1 teaspoon [[Dried mixed herbs|dried mixed herbs]]\n| Plenty of [[aluminium foil]]\n<span class=\"review\">\n<span class=\"reviewHeader\">\n====Random recipe review====\n</span>\n''<span class=\"reviewTitle\">Unbelievable</span>''\n\n<span style=\"line-height:180%\"><span style=\"font-size:180%;\"><span class=\"reviewScore\">5</span>/5 </span>\n\n<span class=\"reviewDesc\">Until I tried this, I did not believe it would be possible.

It won't hurt if it's left for a little longer.\n| Check the chicken has reached a [[safe cooking temperature]] [74 \u00b0C (165 \u00b0F)]\n}}\n===Variations===\nUse a packet of [[Taco seasoning]] as a rub for the [[Chicken|chicken]] or make your own here: [[Tex-Mex seasoning]]\n===Chef's notes===\nI would start with a medium sized chicken unless you are sure that a large chicken will fit.  We have a large Morphy Richards 6.5 litre slow cooker and a small chicken fitted easily, but I'm not so sure that a large one would fit.\n\n'''A little more environmentally friendly:''' Revisiting this recipe, the reason for the [[aluminium foil]] is just to stop the [[chicken]] overcooking should it make contact with the [[crockpot]]. It seems rather wasteful to use so much [[aluminium foil]] and then chuck it away afterwards so I looked for an alternative.  An ovenproof plate would be good but it has to be surprisingly small to fit in a slow cooker.  After a few experiments, a lattice of spoons worked the best. I still use a ball of [[aluminium foil]] on each side to hold the legs away from the edge of a cooker.\n\nYou could also rest the chicken on some [[carrots]], [[parsnips]] and [[onions]] which would serve the same purpose.\n==See also==\n* www.ibelieveicanfry.com/2013/04/slow-cooker-rotisserie-chicken.html\n* http://www.paleocupboard.com/slow-cooker-rotisserie-chicken.html\n* [[Slow cooker chicken (slow cooker recipe)]]\n* [[Roasting a turkey in a slow cooker]]\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:North American recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:Poultry recipes]]\n[[Category:Slow cooker recipes]]\n[[Category:I believe I can fry recipes]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n[[Category:Slow cooked]]\n[[Category:Recipes from other sites]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#chicken #aluminiumfoil #roastingachickeninaslowcooker #slowcooker #onion #oliveoil #freshherbs #tacoseasoning #heart #smokedpaprikapowder #liver </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
