Go on, indulge!\n\nIf you like these, give our [[Spam pizza]] a try as well!\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 1 tin [[Spam]], cut into 10 mm (1/2\" slices)\n| [[Olive oil]] for [[Frying|frying]]\n}}\n\n'''[[Batter]] mix'''\n* 60 g [[Self-raising flour|self-raising flour]]\n* 1 [[Egg|egg]], beaten\n* Splash of [[Guinness]], [[Bitter|bitter]] or if you must, [[Milk|milk]] and water mixed (about 35 to 40 ml of liquid is required)\n* Splash of [[Louisiana hot pepper sauce]] or [[Tabasco sauce]] (to taste)\n* Pinch of [[Salt|salt]]\n* A little plain flour\n\n\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Add all of the dry [[batter]] ingredients to a bowl, then whisking well, add just enough fluid ([[Guinness]], [[Bitter|bitter]], or the [[Milk|milk]]/water mix) to make a thick batter. Add the egg and mix it in extremely well.\n| Rest the batter in the [[refrigerator]] for 20 minutes if you can\n| Dip each piece of spam in a saucer of plain flour and knock off any excess (this helps the batter mix to stick)\n| Dip each piece of spam in the batter \n| Heat a shallow [[Frying pan|frying pan]] with a little [[Oil|oil]]. When it has just started to smoke, reduce the heat a little and [[Fry|fry]] the fritters a few at a time for 3 minutes a side\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\n\nServe hot with [[Baked beans|baked beans]], [[Chips|chips]] and [[Branston pickle]] or [[OK Sauce]]\n=== Tip ===\n\nTo make it easier to dip the pieces of spam in the batter, use a fork and spear the slice about 1cm from its end. Have the bowl of batter as close to the frying pan as possible, then dip the Spam and transfer into the hot oil immediately. Slide the fritter off the fork with a knife or other metal implement. '''Do not use your fingers at any point - severe burns can occur!!'''\n\nAlternatively, if you're handy with a pair of chopsticks, you can grip the end of the Spam with them and do the dipping and transferring that way. For me, the only disadvantage of this method is that there is always a 'naked' uncovered bit on the fritter. Forking it is the only way!!!\n==See also==\n{{FritterRecipes}}\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Cooking with beer]]\n[[Category:Historic recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:Pork recipes]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:North American recipes]]\n[[Category:Student recipes]]\n[[Category:Pan fried]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#spamfritters #guinness #bitter #branstonpickle #chips #spam #batter #bakedbeans #fritter #frying #fry </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
