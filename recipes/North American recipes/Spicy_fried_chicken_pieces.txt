I've used [[Olive oil|olive oil]] but you could use any [[Vegetable oil|vegetable oil]].  If you do use [[Olive oil|olive oil]], as its smoke point is much lower that most [[Frying|frying]] [[Oils|oils]], so keep the temperature lower than you normally would, or put the smoke alarm in the garden!\n\nAlthough the preparation time is shown as 4 hours, you could sacrifice the [[Marination|marination]] period if you were short on time.\n\nI've used [[Tex-Mex mix]] for the seasoning, but in place of that you could just add a pinch of [[Chilli powder|chilli powder]] and any powdered [[Spices|spices]] that you fancy.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| 2 large [[Chicken breasts|chicken breasts]], chopped into thumb-sized pieces\n| 1 tablespoon [[Lime juice|lime juice]]\n| &#188; teaspoon [[Salt|salt]] for the [[Marinade|marinade]]\n| 1 teaspoon [[Taco-mix|taco-mix]] for the [[Marinade|marinade]]\n| 1 large [[Clove|clove]] of [[Garlic, peeled and crushed|garlic, peeled and crushed]]\n| 1 [[Egg|egg]], beaten\n| 2 tablespoons fine [[Cornmeal|cornmeal]]\n| 5 tablespoons [[Plain flour|plain flour]]\n| 1 tablespoon [[Taco-mix|taco-mix]] for the 'batter'\n| Enough [[Olive oil|olive oil]] to fill the base of a [[Wok|wok]] by 1.3cm (1/2\")\n}}\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n\n* Add the [[Chicken|chicken]] pieces, [[Salt|salt]], [[Taco-mix|taco-mix]], [[Lime juice|lime juice]] and [[Crushed garlic|crushed garlic]] to a [[Lock and Lock box]], replace the lid, shake very well and leave in the [[Fridge|fridge]] for 3 or four hours to [[Marinade|marinade]], shaking now and then if you can.\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Chicken pieces frying in the wok.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Chicken pieces frying in the wok\nImage:Chicken pieces coated with flour, ready to fry.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Chicken pieces coated with flour, ready to fry\n</gallery>\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| Heat the [[Olive oil|olive oil]] in a [[Wok|wok]] or [[Frying pan|frying pan]].  Not too hot that it smokes.\n| Add the [[Taco-mix|taco-mix]] (or your desired [[Spices|spices]]) to a bowl containing the [[Plain flour|plain flour]] and mix well.\n| When you are ready to [[Fry|fry]] the [[Chicken|chicken]], add two tablespoons of [[Cornmeal|cornmeal]] to the [[Chicken|chicken]] pieces and shake really well to coat the chicken evenly.\n| Beat the [[Egg|egg]] and add to a bowl.\n| [[Dip]] each pice of [[Chicken|chicken]] in the beaten [[Egg|egg]], then coat coat with the spicy [[Flour|flour]] mix, then carefully add to the hot [[Oil|oil]].  Do this in two batches so you don't overwhelm the [[Oil|oil]] and kill the temperature.\n| [[Fry]] for about 2 to 3 minutes, turning often.\n| Remove the cooked [[Chicken|chicken]] with a [[Slotted spoon|slotted spoon]] and allow to drain on kitchen paper.\n| Check the [[Chicken|chicken]] is properly cooked, though it should be fine as the pieces are very small and turning them ensures an even heat.\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe with a mixed [[Salad|salad]]\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:North American recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Poultry recipes]]\n[[Category:Pan fried]]\n[[Category:Favourite recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#chicken #oliveoil #spicyfriedchickenpieces #egg #marinade #wok #limejuice #plainflour #fry #cornmeal #spices </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
