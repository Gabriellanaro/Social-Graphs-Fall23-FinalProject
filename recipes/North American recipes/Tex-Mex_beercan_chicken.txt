The basic idea is to carefully balance the chicken on a 3/4 full can of beer using its legs as an additional support, coat it with a flavoured rub and [[roast]] it.  The [[Steam|steam]] from the beer permeates the chicken to produce a succulent dish.  I think my [[Taco mix|taco mix]] suits this admirably, though any flavoured rub would do.\n\nOur American friends seem to barbecue chicken using this method, and though I'm sure it's worth trying, I can't believe that the upper part of the chicken would even get warm on our barbecue.  And we have a BIG barbecue.  I would welcome any feedback.\n\nThe process is made even easier and safer with one of these: [[Grillpro Stainless Steel Chicken Roaster]].\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 1.5kg free range [[Chicken|chicken]]\n| 6 tablespoons [[Taco mix|taco mix]], El Paso taco mix or a seasoning rub of your choice\n| 2 tablespoons [[Olive oil|olive oil]]\n| 440ml can of [[Beer|beer]] or [[Lager|lager]] \n| 1 [[tangerine]] or [[orange]] (optional)\n\n}}\n\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n* Preheat the oven to 200\u00b0 C (400\u00b0 F - Gas 6)\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Wash the outside of the beer can\n| [[Parson's nose|Remove the parson's nose]], any giblets, bags, tranklements etc. from the [[Chicken|chicken]] \n| Cut off and discard the [[Parson's nose]].\n| Rinse inside and out under cold running water and pat dry with kitchen towel\n| Rub 1 tablespoon of the [[Taco mix|taco mix]] into the cavity of the bird \n| Rub the outside of the [[Chicken|chicken]] with the [[Olive oil|olive oil]] and coat with 3 tablespoons of [[Taco mix|taco mix]]\n| Seal the neck of the bird by folding over and skewering with [[skewers]] or [[cocktail sticks]] \n| Open the [[Beer|beer]] and toast the start of the proceedings with about a &#188; of the beer - you don't want a full can\n| Punch a few holes around the empty top-part of the can\n| Add the remaining rub to the [[Beer|beer]] tin\n| Sit the [[Chicken|chicken]] on the [[Beer|beer]] can in a baking tray and balance it on its legs. A small chicken sits quite happily; a large chicken might be a bit trickier\n| Cut the top off the tangerine so the juice can run down while it cooks, affix with a [[cocktail stick]] into the top cavity (see photo) and add the cut slice as a hat!\n| Place the baking tray in the bottom of the oven\n| After 30 minutes, reduce the heat to 180\u00b0 C ( 350\u00b0 F - Gas 4)\n| The [[Chicken|chicken]] should be cooked in about 1.5 hours [total cooking timw], depending upon the size of the bird. Check every 15 minutes towards the end.  It is done when the juices run clear if the deepest part of the flesh (eg the thigh) is pierced with a metal skewer or sharp knife\n| Remove the [[Chicken|chicken]] extremely carefully with [[Oven gloves|oven gloves]] and tongs if needed.\n| Allow to rest for 10 minutes before carving\n}}\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Tex-Mex beercan chicken ready.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Oven-ready!\nImage:Tex-Mex beercan chicken ingredients.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The basic ingredients\n</gallery>\n===Serving suggestions===\nUsing [[The Jamie Oliver carving method|the Jamie Oliver carving method]], serve with [[roast potatoes]] and [[garlic mayonnaise]].\n\nThe remaining beer could be used to make gravy if needed.\n===Variations===\nTry this with a cock [[pheasant]] (hens are too small) and use [[cider]] or [[wine]] instead of [[beer]].  Wash out an empty 440 ml [[beer]] can and pour 330 ml of dry white [[wine]] or dry [[cider]] into it.  For this, a [[herb]] and [[Garlic|garlic]] rub is excellent - this can be made with the ingredients (minus the [[onion]] and [[pork]]) used in the [[Slow roast herby pork belly]] recipe.\n\nWe have also tried this with a small [[duck]], but the cavity was too large for the [[beer]] can, but not big enough for two cans.  Duckling might be worth a try if you can get it.\n===Chicken falls over?===\nMy chicken has just fallen over, I may have to get one of these: [http://www.socal.co.uk/BBQ_Accessories/Beer_Can_Chicken/Grillpro_Stainless_Steel_Chicken_Roaster/332/17302 (beer can) Chicken roaster]\n\nLarge chickens seem to be ok - it's the smaller birds that have problems balancing on a beer can.  440ml is probably the biggest can you should use with all but the largest birds. The last few times I have made this, I have placed the chicken and can inside an oven proof saucepan, in the oven, so the chicken has a little more support if it tends to lean over.  It also makes far less mess if it does fall over!\n\n... or go for the real thing: '''[[Grillpro Stainless Steel Chicken Roaster]]'''!\n{{Template:Beercan chicken - See also}}\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes|Chicken]]\n[[Category:Chilli pepper recipes|Chicken]]\n[[Category:Cooking with beer|Chicken]]\n[[Category:Main courses|Chicken]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes|Chicken]]\n[[Category:Poultry recipes|Chicken]]\n[[Category:Spicy recipes|Chicken]]\n[[Category:North American recipes]]\n[[Category:Tex-Mex recipes|Chicken]]\n[[Category:Cooking with wine]]\n[[Category:Favourite recipes]]\n[[Category:Student recipes]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#beer #chicken #texmexbeercanchicken #tacomix #oliveoil #wine #cider #cocktailstick #roastpotatoes #steam #orange </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
