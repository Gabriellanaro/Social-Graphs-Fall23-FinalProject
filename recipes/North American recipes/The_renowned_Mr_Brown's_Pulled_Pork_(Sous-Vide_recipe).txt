However as there are lots of powerful spices in this, in the [[sous-vide bath]] for 24 hours will be just as good without the extended marinating.\n\nCooking this sous-vide makes the meat really tender, however the onions and apples don't break down as well as they do when it is cooked conventionally. I've found the solution to this to blitz the gravy with [[stick blender]].\n\nThe [[Meat|meat]] is great as a main meal with [[salad]] and [[potatoes]].  My favourite way is to have it as a [[Kebab|kebab]]-type filling in [[Pitta bread|pitta bread]] with [[Salad|salad]].\n\nI have included this in the North American recipe category as a homage to the original.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 1.3 kg (3 lb) boneless [[Pork shoulder|pork shoulder]]\n| &#189; tablespoon coarsely [[Ground black pepper|ground black pepper]]\n| &#189; tablespoon coarsely ground [[Szechuan pepper]]\n| 1 tablespoon [[Smoked paprika powder|smoked paprika powder]]\n| 3 tablespoons [[Paprika powder|paprika powder]]\n| 4 tablespoons [[muscovado sugar]]\n| 2 teaspoons [[Coarse sea salt|coarse sea salt]]\n| 2 teaspoons [[Mustard powder|mustard powder]])\n| 2 tablespoons [[Garlic powder|garlic powder]]\n| 1 tablespoon [[Ginger powder|ginger powder]]\n| 2 [[Bird's eye chili peppers|Bird's eye chili pepper]] ground to powder (or chilli of choice, to taste.)\n| &#190; cup [[white wine]]\n| 1 [[Onion|onion]], peeled and roughly chopped\n| 1 [[Armagh_Bramley_Apples|Bramley apple]], peeled, cored and sliced\n}}\n\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Mix the [[Spices|spices]] and add to a very large [[vacuum bag]] together with the chopped [[onions]] and [[apple]]\n| Carefully slice the rind from the joint and discard it.\n| Cut the pork joint into smaller pieces or slash it up so the marinade can penetrate easily\n| Add to [[vacuum bag]] with the remaining ingredients\n| [[Vacuum seal]] the bag.  Use the cancel button and 'Seal Only' button to prevent liquid being pulled into the [[vacuum sealer]]\n| Leave in the fridge to 12 hours or more\n| Cook in a [[sous vide water bath]] for 24 hours at 80\u00b0 C [176\u00b0 F]\n| Remove the meat and shred with 2 forks\n| Blitz the gravy mixture with a [[stick blender]] and thicken and reheat before mixing the meat back in. \n}}\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:The renowned Mr Brown Pulled Pork - shredding.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Shred with two forks\nImage:The renowned Mr Brown Pulled Pork - (sous-vide recipe).jpg|thumb|300px|right|Vacuum sealed and ready to cook for 24 hours at 70 degrees C.  ''An egg to show scale''\n</gallery>\n\n===Chef's notes===\nRunning low on the 'fridge white wine', I used a mix of [[white wine]], [[sherry]] and [[calvados]]!\n\nBe careful removing such a large (and quite hot) vacuum bag from the sous vide bath. The bottom of my bag split slightly as I lifted it out, luckily only losing a little of the gravy.  Support it as you lift it out!\n===Serving suggestions===\nShred with two forks and serve with [[jacket potatoes]] and a [[salad]] with [[sour cream]] as a dip.\n{{Template:See-also-pulled-pork}}\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:North American recipes]]\n[[Category:Pork recipes]]\n[[Category:Cooking with wine]]\n[[Category:Sous vide recipes]]\n[[Category:Sous vide cooking]]\n[[Category:FotoosVanRobin recipes]]\n[[Category:Stewed, braised or pot roasted]]\n[[Category:Favourite recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#salad #whitewine #stickblender #vacuumbag #potatoes #onions #armagh_bramley_apples #onion #therenownedmrbrownspulledporksousviderecipe #vacuumseal #garlicpowder </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
