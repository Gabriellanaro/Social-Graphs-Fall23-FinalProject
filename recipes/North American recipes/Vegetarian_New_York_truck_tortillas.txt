Also, hats off to all the food truck guys for feeding blacked-out areas of New York at cost price during Hurricane Sandy in October 2012 \n\nThe [[Bean|bean]] mix here is gorgeous; creamy and filling without being stodgy and bloaty, with a lovely clean beany flavour, and the various trimmings go incredibly well with it. Unlike some UK interpretations of [[Tortillas|tortillas]], these are free from the ersatz flavours of [[Refried beans|refried beans]], [[Cumin|cumin]] and [[Garlic|garlic]]. What follows are broad guidelines \u2013 this is mainly about the [[Black bean|black bean]] recipe.\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| 8 [[Soft corn tortillas|soft corn tortillas]] \n}}\n====the beans ====\n{{RecipeIngredientsNB\n| 200g [[Black beans|black beans]], soaked for 2 hours and drained \n| 2 medium [[Carrots|carrots]], peeled and quartered \n| 3 sticks of [[Celery|celery]] sliced lengthways and cut in two \n| 2 [[Onions|onions]], halved \n| large bunch of [[Coriander|coriander]] stalks, tied together with string \n| 2 [[Bay leaves|bay leaves]] \n| 4 small [[Spring onions|spring onions]], finely chopped \n| 1 tablespoon powdered [[Coriander|coriander]] \n| [[Salt]] and [[Pepper|pepper]] \n| 2 tablespoons chopped [[Coriander leaves|coriander leaves]]\n}}\n====the [[Guacamole|guacamole]]==== \n{{RecipeIngredientsNB\n| 2 ripe [[Avocados|avocados]], [[Mashed|mashed]] \n| 1 teaspoon [[Cayenne|cayenne]] \n| [[Juice|juice]] of a [[Lime|lime]] \n| [[Sea Salt|sea salt]] \n}}\n====to serve====\n{{RecipeIngredientsNB\n| 80g [[Cheddar cheese|cheddar cheese]], [[grated]] \n| 140ml [[Sour cream]] \n| 100g [[Iceberg lettuce|iceberg lettuce]], roughly sliced  \n| Chopped mild [[Red chillies|red chillies]], deseeded,  or pickled [[Chillies|chillies]] (San Marcos [[Pickled]] [[Chipotle]] is especially good)\n| 2 halved [[Limes|limes]]\n}}\n\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| Put the soaked and drained [[Beans|beans]], [[Carrot|carrot]], [[Celery|celery]], [[Onions|onions]], [[Bay leaves|bay leaves]] and [[Coriander|coriander]] stalks into a large lidded [[Saucepan|saucepan]], and top up with just enough water to cover everything.\n| Place on a low heat and bring to the [[Boil|boil]].\n| Cook gently for 90 -120 minutes until the beans are tender.\n| Drain and reserve the cooking [[Liquor|liquor]]. Pick out and discard the carrot, celery, onions, [[Bay|bay]] leaves and coriander stalks. \n| Return the drained [[Beans|beans]] to the large [[Saucepan|saucepan]], add 3 tablespoons of the cooking [[Liquor|liquor]], the [[Spring onions|spring onions]], the [[Coriander powder|coriander powder]], and season well. Cook gently for 8 minutes.\n| Check seasoning again, and add a little more liquor if it looks too dry \u2013 the mixture should be very slightly runny.\n| Resist any temptation to [[Mash|mash]], these beans are meant to be kept whole.\n| Stir in the [[Coriander leaves|coriander leaves]].\n| Set aside and keep warm.\n| Warm through the [[Tortillas|tortillas]], then bring everything to the table and let everyone assemble their own wraps and enjoy.\n| Y'all have a nice day now!\n}}\n===Variations===\nFor a [[Vegan|vegan]] version, just omit the [[Cheese|cheese]] and the [[Cream|cream]] use for the topping.\n==See also==\n\n* Another of [[Nik and Edwina's Cookbook]], based largely upon this recipe: [[Deconstructed tortilla salad]]\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:North American recipes]]\n[[Category:Snacks and light bites]]\n[[Category:Spicy recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegan recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes]]\n[[Category:Grain and bean recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegetable recipes]]\n[[Category:Nik and Edwina's Cookbook recipes]]\n[[Category:Boiled or simmered]]\n[[Category:Recipes from other sites]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#coriander #liquor #springonions #celery #corianderleaves #beans #saucepan #bayleaves #tortillas #onions #guacamole </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
