Today, I was delighted to discover [[F. Conisbee specialist butchers]] had them in stock. 4 [[Argentine ribs]] for \u00a321.04.  Robert cut them in half again lengthwise with the bandsaw.

Caesar Cardini (Italian-born [[Mexican]]) is credited with creating the salad.\n\nContrary to popular belief, the original Caesar's [[Salad|salad]] recipe did not contain pieces of [[Anchovy|anchovy]]; the slight anchovy flavour comes from the [[Worcestershire sauce]].

For me though, the essential deep pan Chicago pizza comes not from Tortuga's but from Bob M. Payton's 300 seat 'Chicago Pizza Pie Factory', deep-down in the basement, in a corner of London's Hanover Square.  It would have been in 1980-something, when mobile phones were the size of car batteries and the Internet was unknown.\n\nIn those days the queues would reach all the way down the stairs to a 'boxing-ring', where you would stand and take your pre-meal drinks.  The Chicago Pizza Pie Factory was a forerunner of Hard-Rock style themed restaurants. Loud rock music played and big screens showed American sports. The decor of the place was authentic Chicago Americana and the food was fantastic with super-slick service that used a really clever idea - A flashing neon sign: 'My Kinda Town'. The flickering letter would indicate to the waitresses which table area of the huge restaurant had food ready to be served.\n\nBob died in the mid 90's and I believe the restaurant closed around that time too.  I notice that a restaurant of the same name exists in Dublin.  I would be interested to see if it bears any resemblance to the original.\n\nThis was absolutely fantastic and nothing like as difficult as you might think.  Thanks for the inspiration Julia - I believe you can!\n===How to ensure a crispy base===\nHaving made these deep pan pizzas many, many times, I've found that sometimes it's hard to get the base well cooked without burning the rest of the [[pizza dough]].  I've found the best way is to use a metal-based pan, similar to a baking tray.  The metal base gets hot enough to crisp the base properly.  I have a cast iron  rectangular Le Creuset baking tray that is absolutely ideal.  It seems a shame as it will mean I'll never use my earthenware deep pan pizza dish again!\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Cooking the chorizo sausage.jpg\nImage:Chicago chorizo pie pizza cheese.jpg\nImage:Chicago chorizo pie pizza filled.jpg\nImage:Chicago chorizo pie pizza topping.jpg\nImage:Chicago pizza pie ready to bake.jpg\nImage:Chicago pizza pie baked.jpg\n</gallery>\n[[Image:ChickenDeepPanPizza.jpg|300px|thumb|right|A chicken and sweetcorn deep pan pizza version, cooked in a Le Creuset pan]]\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| The sausage-meat removed from 400g of uncooked [[Chorizo]] style [[sausages]] - ''these are not cured so need to be pre cooked''\n| 1 small [[Onion|onion]], chopped finely\n| 1 portion of [[Pizza dough|pizza dough]]\n| [[Fine yellow cornmeal]] for dusting\n| 110 g (4 oz) [[Cheddar cheese]], [[Grated|grated]]\n| A big handful of fresh [[Mushrooms|mushrooms]], brushed and sliced\n| 85 g (3.5 oz) freshly [[Grated|grated]] [[Parmesan cheese]]\n| 1 large can of chopped peeled [[Tomatoes|tomatoes]], left to drain over a coarse sieve for 5 minutes\n| 1 tablespoon [[Dried|dried]] [[Garlic powder|garlic powder]]\n| 1 teaspoon [[Dried|dried]] [[Mexican oregano]]\n| 1 teaspoon [[Dried|dried]] [[Parsley|parsley]]\n| Pinch of [[Mixed herbs|mixed herbs]]\n| 1 teaspoon [[Chilli flakes|chilli flakes]] (Guajillo - not too hot)\n| Pinch of [[Black pepper|black pepper]]\n| 1 ball of [[Buffalo|buffalo]] [[Mozzarella|mozzarella]], torn\n\n}}\n\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n\n* Preheat the [[Oven|oven]] to 190\u00b0 C (375\u00b0 F - gas 5), [fan oven 170\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins]\n* Remove the sausagemeat from the sausages and discard the skins\n* Make the [[pizza dough]] as instructed\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| Saut\u00e9 the [[onions]], [[Mushrooms|mushrooms]] and the chorizo sausagemeat in a pan for for about 10 minutes or until the meat is cooked and any liquid has evapourated.

It's nice - a one-pot rice dish.  Simples!</span> \n\n<span class=\"reviewAuthor\"> [[User:PSmith|Paul&nbsp;R&nbsp;Smith]] </span></span>\n}}\nJambalaya always brings to mind the Carpenters song; ''Jambalaya (On the Bayou)''  Not a Carpenters song but a dish traditionally made in one pot, with [[Meats|meats]] and [[Vegetables|vegetables]]. It is completed by adding [[Stock|stock]] and [[Rice|rice]].  Looking at various recipes in more detail, this strikes me now as a typical leftover dish.  Cooking up what you have around at the time.\n===Making this your own recipe===\nWhen I made this for the first time, not having the slightest idea what jambalaya was, it looked quite complex, however, having made it many times now I now think it is probably one of the easiest recipes around. It is also a brilliant recipe to adapt to your own personal taste.  It is also an excellent recipe for using up leftovers.\n\nJust follow a few basic steps and you will be able to make you own version of this recipe.\n* Rinse the rice in cold running water first.\n* Fry the onions, garlic and vegetables first, plus any meat that might need more cooking than the rice does.\n* Ensure the rice is well coated in the oil before adding any stock.\n* Measure the stock by doubling the volume of the rice (4 cups of water to 2 cups of rice, etc.)\n* Don't add all of the stock at once, add more if it looks as though it will dry out before the rice is done.\n* If you have ingredients that don't need much cooking (prawns etc.) or vegetables that you want to serve with a bit of a crunch then add them during the last five minutes of cooking.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 1 x 2kg (4 lb) [[Chicken|chicken]], [[Parson's nose|parson's nose removed]]\n| A few [[Bay leaf|bay leaves]]\n| 1 [[Onion|onion]], unpeeled, chopped into quarters\n| About 200 g from one or more of cooked meat\n| 40 g (1 &frac12; oz) [[Butter|butter]], [[ghee]] or [[olive oil]]\n| 4 to 7 [[Cloves garlic, peeled and crushed|cloves garlic, peeled and crushed]]\n| 6 [[Spring onions|spring onions]], [[Chopped on the diagonal|chopped on the diagonal]]\n| 2 sticks of [[Celery|celery]], 'strings' removed with a [[Mandoline|mandoline]] and chopped into moons\n| 3 or 4 sweet [[Bell peppers|bell peppers]], any colour, deseeded and chopped\n| 3 teaspoons [[Paprika powder|paprika powder]]\n| &#189; teaspoon of [[dried oregano]] or [[dried mixed herbs]]\n| 2 tablespoons fresh [[Basil leaves|basil leaves]], chopped, if available\n| 1 large can [[Plum|plum]] [[Tomatoes|tomatoes]], chopped\n| 500ml to 600 ml of the water the [[Chicken|chicken]] was [[Boiled|boiled]] in\n| 1 tablespoon [[Worcester sauce|Worcester sauce]]\n| [[Chillies]], [[chilli sauce]] or [[chilli powder]] to add warmth, not heat.\n|* I used: 1 teaspoon chili guajillo (powder), 2 teaspoons pasilla chili (diced), 1/2 a teaspoon of chipotle chillies (diced)\n|* Suggested alternative if using sauce: 1 to 2 tablespoons [[Louisiana hot pepper sauce]] (or to taste)\n| [[Sea Salt|sea salt]] and [[Freshly ground black pepper|freshly ground black pepper]]\n| 400 g (14 oz) [[Basmati rice|basmati rice]] ([[Long grain rice|long grain rice]])\n}}\n''' Garnish'''\n* Finely chopped [[Parsley|parsley]]\n\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Remove any giblets, cut off and discard the [[Parson's nose]].\n| Wash the [[Chicken|chicken]] under cold running water, inside and out\n| Place the [[Chicken|chicken]] in a large pot and pour over just enough [[Boiling|boiling]] water to cover\n| Add the [[Onion|onion]] and the [[Bay leaf|bay leaf]] and [[Boil|boil]] for about 1 hour or until tender\n| Set the [[Chicken|chicken]] to one side, reserve the [[Stock|stock]] and discard the [[Bay leaf|bay leaf]] and [[Onion|onion]] quarters\n| Once chicken has cooled discard skin and bone\n| Heat the [[Butter|butter]] in a large pan and [[Fry|fry]] the [[Garlic|garlic]] for a few minutes\n| Add the [[Ham|ham]], [[Spring onions|spring onions]], [[Celery|celery]] and [[Pepper|pepper]] and [[Saut\u00e9|saut\u00e9]] for 5 minutes\n| Rinse rice under cold running water for a few minutes until the water runs clear\n| Add the [[Rice|rice]] and [[Stir-fry|stir-fry]] for a minute so the grains are coated by the oil\n| Add the [[Stock|stock]] (about 500 ml to start), [[Tomatoes|tomatoes]], [[Spices|spices]], [[Worcester sauce|Worcester sauce]], [[Hot pepper sauce|hot pepper sauce]], [[Salt|salt]] and [[Pepper|pepper]] and [[Chicken|chicken]]\n| Stir well, cover and [[Simmer|simmer]] on a very low hob until the liquid has gone and the [[Rice|rice]] is cooked.

I have not quite doubled the stock quantity so keep an eye on the water level to ensure that it does not dry out.\n\nRather than using [[chili sauce]] for the heat I used a mixture of my [[Exotic chili powders]] to add more than just heat.  The quantities I used did not make this hot (like a chili), just a little warmth.\n\nThe [[stock]] left from cooking the chicken is really good quality so whatever you don't use, freeze in bags or cups far later use.\n\n==See also==\n* http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jambalaya\n* http://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/1167651/chicken-and-chorizo-jambalaya\n* http://www.deliaonline.com/recipes/type-of-dish/one-pot-meals/chicken-jambalaya.html\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes|Jambalaya]]\n[[Category:Historic recipes|Jambalaya]]\n[[Category:Indian recipes|Jambalaya]]\n[[Category:Main courses|Jambalaya]]\n[[Category:Poultry recipes|Jambalaya]]\n[[Category:Rice recipes|Jambalaya]]\n[[Category:Spicy recipes|Jambalaya]]\n[[Category:Tex-Mex recipes|Jambalaya]]\n[[Category:North American recipes|Jambalaya]]\n[[Category:Favourite recipes]]\n[[Category:Boiled or simmered]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#chickenjambalaya #chicken #stock #onion #bayleaf #celery #rice #worchestersauce #ham #butter #parsley </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"

This recipe is not cooked [[sous-vide]] in the way you would normally.  I don't have a 6 litre sous-vide cooker, I've used my [[home-made sous-vide cooker]] and instead of cooking in a vacuum sealed bag, I've just used the slow cooker with scrunched up baco-foil to provide a better seal.  This could be simply replicated in a slow cooker that has a very accurate temperature setting, should such a thing exist outside of my house!\n\nIf you are luck enough to have a sous-vide cooker that can accomodate 6 litres I would be inclined to premix everything in a bowl first and vacuum seal but manually seal the container before liquid is drawn into the [[vacuum sealer]]. \n\nThe recipe is very similar to the original , The Manhattan Chili Co's famous \u200e[[Chili con carne numero uno]].  The main differences are that I've used [[leeks]] instead of onions and altered the cooking method .\n\n''This was not very successful - the prolonged cooking time make the oregano and cinnamon far too strong - stick to the [[Chili con carne numero uno|original]] - it's far better!''\n\n''1 cup in this recipe represents 237 ml''\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| &#188; cup of [[Olive oil|olive oil]]\n| Freshly [[ground black pepper]]\n| 4 large [[leeks]], trimmed and chopped (4 cups)\n| 500 g (1 lb 2 oz) [[Minced beef|minced beef]] (''[[Ground beef|ground beef]]'')\n| 500 g (1lb 2 oz) [[Minced|minced]] [[Pork|pork]] (''[[Ground|ground]] pork'')\n| 2 teaspoons [[Sea Salt|sea salt]]\n| 4 heaped tablespoons of unsmoked [[paprika powder]]\n| 2 scant fresh [[Cumin seeds|cumin seeds]], [[Toasted|toasted]] and [[Ground|ground]] to a powder in a [[Coffee grinder|coffee grinder]]\n| 2 scant tablespoons [[Dried|dried]] [[Mexican oregano]]\n| 2 tablespoons unsweetened [[Cocoa powder|cocoa powder]] (Green & Black's or similar quality product)\n| 1 large whole stick of [[cinnamon]] bark to be removed and discarded after cooking\n| 1.5 teaspoons of [[Exotic chilli powders|ancho chilli powder]]\n| 2 teaspoons of [[Exotic chilli powders|chilli chipotle flakes]]\n| Good shake of [[Louisiana hot pepper sauce]]\n| Good shake of [[lime juice]]\n| 4 cups [[Passata]] (tomato)\n| 3 cups [[Beef Stock|beef stock]]\n| 8 [[Garlic cloves, peeled and crushed|garlic cloves, peeled and crushed]]\n| 1 to 3 tablespoons of coarse [[Yellow cornmeal|yellow cornmeal]] for thickening\n| 2 cans [[Red kidney beans|red kidney beans]], drained\n}}\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Chili con carne numero uno and rice.jpg|Chili con carne numero uno, [[homemade tortilla chips]], [[plain rice]], [[soured cream]] and [[orange]] slices\nImage:Chili con carne numero uno sous-vide.jpg|Home-made sous-vide cooker (and sous-vide ''bag''!)\nImage:The Manhattan chili co ingredients.jpg|Chili con carne numero uno, the ingredients\nImage:Manhattan Chili Co - Goodbye.jpg|The Manhattan Chili Co is now closed.\n</gallery>\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| In a [[Wok|wok]] or large [[Frying pan|frying pan]], heat the [[Oil|oil]] and add a grind of black pepper then gently cook the [[leeks]] for 20 minutes until soft - don't brown them.\n| Meantime, in a separate pan, add a small amount of the [[Oil|oil]] from the [[Onions|onions]], just to prevent the [[Meat|meat]] from sticking and add the [[Pork|pork]], [[Beef|beef]] and [[salt]].

Have the bowl of batter as close to the frying pan as possible, then dip the Spam and transfer into the hot oil immediately. Slide the fritter off the fork with a knife or other metal implement. '''Do not use your fingers at any point - severe burns can occur!!'''\n\nAlternatively, if you're handy with a pair of chopsticks, you can grip the end of the Spam with them and do the dipping and transferring that way. For me, the only disadvantage of this method is that there is always a 'naked' uncovered bit on the fritter. Forking it is the only way!!!\n\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Cooking with beer]]\n[[Category:Historic recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:Beef recipes]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:North American recipes]]\n[[Category:Student recipes]]\n[[Category:Pan fried]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#cornedbeeffritters #guinness #bitter #batter #tabascosauce #electricmixer #branstonpickle #bakedbeans #fry #egg #refrigerator </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"

I have amended it to use a [[slow cooker]] and for once, used commercial [[curry powder]] rather than a homemade blend.\n\n===Update===\nThe ingredients shown below have been much reduced from the original recipe because, to my taste, it was almost bitter.  To rescue the meal, I discarded all of the original gravy and served it with potatoes, carrots, peas and a normal [[onion gravy]].  It still had a little of the curry bite so was not a complete disaster. The lamb shanks were perfectly cooked and delicious.\n\nIf you do make this, taste the gravy and adjust the seasoning before the extended cooking period.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| 100 ml [[olive oil]]\n| 2 [[Lamb shanks|lamb shanks]]\n| [[Sea Salt|sea salt]] & [[Freshly ground black pepper|freshly ground black pepper]]\n| 2 [[Onions|onions]], peeled and sliced\n| 1 bulb of [[Garlic, peeled and crushed|garlic, peeled and crushed]]\n| 2 teaspoons of [[curry powder]]\n| 1 teaspoon [[Cumin seeds|cumin seeds]], lightly [[Toasted|toasted]] and finely [[Ground|ground]]\n| 1 teaspoon of [[Dried|dried]] [[Mexican oregano]]\n| 1 tablespoon [[muscovado sugar]]\n| 1 tin peeled [[Plum tomatoes|plum tomatoes]]\n| 330 ml [[Guinness]] (1 bottle)\n| 100 ml [[Beef Stock|beef stock]]\n| ''optional'' - 2 teaspoons [[Exotic chilli powders|mild chilli powder]] (''guajillo'')\n}}\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Curried lamb shanks.jpg|300px|thumb|right|After 4 hours slow cooking\nImage:Manhattan Chili Co - Goodbye.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The Manhattan Chili Co is now closed.\n</gallery>\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| In a large flameproof [[Casserole|casserole]] or [[Dutch Oven|dutch oven]], heat 100 ml of [[olive oil]], when hot add a good pinch of [[Black pepper|black pepper]] and  [[Brown|brown]] the [[Lamb shank|lamb shank]] really well on all sides, this should take around 15 minutes.\n| Sprinkle the [[Lamb shanks|lamb shanks]] with a pinch of [[Salt|salt]] and pop them in the [[slow cooker]].

The [[tortillas]] are slightly [[fried]] and filled with [[frijoles refritos]] ([[refried beans]]) and [[pork]], or in this recipe spicy [[chorizo]].  I cheated with the refried beans as I didn't have time to soak them so I used canned, which are ok if but a little too salty.  I used [[Emmental cheese]], which is not authentic but I though it would work well. It did.

The origins of the dish are unclear. The dish was previously largely unknown in China and other lands home to the Chinese. Thus, General Tso's [[Chicken]] is most likely an American invention in the history of American-Chinese food.\n\nThe association with General Tso, or Zuo Zongtang, a Qing dynasty general and statesman, is unclear. The dish is atypical of Hunanese cuisine, which is traditionally very spicy and rarely sweet. Instead, the dish is believed to have been introduced to New York City in the early 1970s as an example of Hunan and Szechuan-style cooking.\n\nThe dish was first mentioned in The New York Times in 1977. It has many similarities to [[Kung Po chicken]].\n\nPeng Chang-kuei, the 98 year old chef who created the much-loved Chinese dish General Tso's Chicken died on 4th December 2016 in Taipei, the capital of Taiwan.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 450 g (1 lb) boneless [[Chicken|chicken]] thighs cut into 2.5 cm (1\") cubes\n| 1 tablespoon [[Light soy sauce|light soy sauce]]\n| 1 beaten [[Egg|egg]]\n| [[Freshly ground black pepper]], to taste\n| 3 tablespoons of [[Cornflour|cornflour]]\n}}\n'''>[[Sauce]]:'''\n* 2 tablespoons [[Dark soy sauce|dark soy sauce]]\n* 1 tablespoon [[Black rice vinegar|black rice vinegar]]\n* 2 teaspoons Chinese [[Rice wine|rice wine]] or [[Dry sherry|dry sherry]]\n* 1 tablespoon [[Sugar|sugar]]\n* 3 tablespoons [[Chicken stock|chicken stock]] or water\n* 1 tablespoon minced [[Garlic|garlic]]\n* 1 tablespoon [[Minced|minced]] [[Ginger|ginger]]\n* 1 teaspoon [[Cornflour|cornflour]] for thickening\n'''>[[Stir-fry]]'''\n* 3 [[Spring onions|spring onions]], [[Chopped on the diagonal|chopped on the diagonal]]\n* 6 [[Dried|dried]] red birds' eye [[Chili peppers|chili peppers]] or to taste\n**[[Peanut]] or [[Vegetable oil|vegetable oil]] for [[Stir-frying|stir-frying]] and [[Deep frying|deep frying]]\n\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Mix the [[Egg|egg]], [[Soy sauce|soy sauce]], [[Pepper|pepper]] and [[Cornflour|cornflour]] to make a thin [[Batter|batter]] and coat the [[Chicken|chicken]] cubes.

The peas, or beans with little black \"eyes,\" signify coins. Fill your plate with them and your cup will run over, as in the 23rd Psalm, perhaps. [[Collard greens]] along with this dish are supposed to also add to the wealth since they are the colour of money.

If using spicy sausages I would wait for 1 hour before adding them\n| Add water or [[Chicken stock|chicken stock]] and bring to the [[Boil|boil]]\n| Reduce the heat and [[Simmer|simmer]] for 2 hours or until the [[Peas|peas]] are tender. (do not [[Boil|boil]] as the [[Beans|beans]] will burst)\n| Remove [[Bacon|bacon]], [[ham hock]] or [[Sausages|sausages]] and cut into bite-sized pieces\n| As with all [[rice]], rinse for a minute, in a sieve under cold running water to remove any excess starch\n| Return [[Meat|meat]] to pot.

The result is a salty, stripped, semi-sweet snack that can be stored without [[refrigeration]]. Jerky is an early application of food preservation techniques.\n===Preparation===\nAny single preparation, or recipe for jerky typically uses only one type of meat. Of the many types of meat that may be used, [[beef]] is the most common. Meat from other animals\u2014such as wild game, [[venison]], elk, caribou and moose\u2014is also used. Recently, other meats have come to market, such as [[turkey]], [[ostrich]], [[salmon]], alligator, and [[tuna]]. The meat must be dried quickly, to limit bacterial growth during the critical period where the meat is not yet dry. To do this, the meat is thinly sliced, or pressed thinly, in the case of ground meat. Drying is performed at low temperatures, to avoid cooking or over drying the meat and making it brittle.\n===Space jerky===\nSince 1996, jerky has been selected by astronauts several times for space flight due to its light weight and high level of nutrition.\n[[Image:Space jerky.jpg|300px|thumb|right|Jerky on International Space Station with Earth visible through the window. Carried to ISS aboard STS-118, Endevour Space Shuttle flight]]\n[[Jerky]] can be made from almost any lean [[Meat|meat]], with [[Beef|beef]] or [[Venison|venison]] being the best. If made from [[Pork|pork]] the [[Meat|meat]] must be treated to kill the trichinella parasite before it is sliced and [[Marinated|marinated]]. This parasite could cause trichinosis. To treat the [[Pork|pork]], [[Freeze|freeze]] a portion that is 15cm or less thick at -15\u00b0C or lower for 20 days. [[Poultry]] is not recommended for [[Jerky|jerky]], because of its texture when raw.\n===Recipe preparation===\nThe [[Meat|meat]] is [[Marinated|marinated]] for both flavour and tenderness. Ingredients for [[Marinades|marinades]] include [[Oil|oil]], [[Salt|salt]] and an acid product such as [[Vinegar|vinegar]], [[Lemon juice|lemon juice]], [[Teriyaki|teriyaki]], [[Soy sauce|soy sauce]] or [[Wine|wine]].\nThe first step in preparing the [[Meat|meat]] is to slice it into long, thin strips. Trim and discard all the [[Fat|fat]] from the [[Meat|meat]], because it becomes rancid rapidly Partially [[Freezing|freezing]] the [[Meat|meat]] before cutting makes it easier to slice evenly Slice with the [[Grain|grain]] into thin strips approximately 6mm thick if a chewy [[Jerky|jerky]] is desired. Slice across the grain for a more tender, brittle [[Jerky|jerky]] A tenderiser can also be used on the meat. \n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 750g of lean [[Meat|meat]], prepared as above\n| &frac14; teaspoon each of [[Pepper|pepper]] and [[Garlic powder|garlic powder]]\n| &frac12; teaspoon [[Onion|onion]] powder\n| 1 teaspoon hickory smoke-flavoured [[Salt|salt]]\n| 60ml [[Soy sauce|soy sauce]]\n| 1 tablespoon [[Worcestershire sauce]]\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| Combine all ingredients. \n| Place strips of [[Meat|meat]] in a bowl and cover with the [[Marinade|marinade]]. \n| Cover and [[Refrigerate|refrigerate]] 1-2 hours or overnight.\n| Remove [[Meat|meat]] strips from the [[Marinade|marinade]], drain on absorbent towelling and arrange on dehydrator trays.

I spotted the [[Gressingham Memphis Barbecue Pulled Duck]] in Morrisons and thought it would make a good [[Taco|taco]] filling. \n\nThe [[Duck|duck]] was very good and I'll be getting more today.  Do note though that the duck is notreally pulled duck, it's duck legs with a sauce that need to be ''pulled'' once they've been cooked.  \n\nThe Old El Paso [[Tacos|tacos]] however, ''really'' let this recipe down.  They are so thin now that they break apart as you touch them. Any because they are so miserably thin, they don't even have the crunch purported on the packet.  Another cynical attempt at increasing profits I guess.\n\nIf you don't want to use the flimsy El Paso [[Tacos]], try to hunt down the cheaper and far nice Discovery [[Taco trays|taco trays]], or forget tacos altogether and use [[Corn|corn]] or [[Flour tortillas|flour tortillas]] instead.\n\nThe [[Duck|duck]] feels like it might serve 4 but is actually contains 2 duck legs, a [[Foil|foil]] tray and a sachet of [[Sauce|sauce]], plenty for 2 people, not enough for four.\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| 1 pack [[Gressingham Memphis BBQ Pulled Duck]] (2 duck legs in with [[Barbecue sauce|barbecue sauce]])\n| 1 Pack Discovery [[Taco trays|taco trays]] or if you must ,1 Pack El Paso [[Taco shells]] (see notes above)\n| 6 [[Spring onions|spring onions]]\n| 12 [[Baby tomatoes|baby tomatoes]]\n| Half a green [[Sweet Pepper|sweet pepper]]\n| 10 [[Black cherries|black cherries]]\n| 150 ml pot of [[Sour cream|sour cream]]\n}}\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n\n* Preheat your [[Oven|oven]] to 180\u00b0 C (350\u00b0 F - gas 4), [fan oven 160\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Memphis BBQ pulled duck tacos ingredients.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The basic ingredients\nImage:Gressingham Memphis Barbecue Pulled Duck.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Gressingham Memphis Barbecue Pulled Duck]] (whole duck legs with sauce)\n</gallery>\n\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| Remove the [[Duck|duck]] legs from the plastic wrapping and place in the tray provided, make sure you include all the lovely [[Fat|fat]] too!\n| Leave the [[Sauce|sauce]] sachet to one side for now\n| [[Roast]] the [[Duck|duck]] legs at 180\u00b0 C for 25 minutes, uncovered, in the tray provided\n| After 25 minutes, drain and discard some of the cooking juices (see [[Chef's notes]] below).\n| Add the contents of the Memphis [[Barbecue sauce|barbecue sauce]] to the duck's legs and mix well\n| [[Bake]] for a further 10 minutes\n| When there is 5 minutes remaining pop the [[Taco trays|taco trays]] or fragile El Paso [[Taco shells|taco shells]] into the [[Oven|oven]] to warm up\n| Meanwhile: chop the [[Spring onions|spring onions]] ([[Scallions|scallions]])\n| Halve the [[Tomatoes|tomatoes]]\n| Halve the [[Cherries|cherries]] and remove the stones\n| Chop the [[Green pepper|green pepper]]\n| Using two forks, shred the [[Duck|duck]] legs with two forks\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe the pulled [[Duck|duck]], [[Vegetables|vegetables]] and [[Tacos|tacos]] and [[Sour cream|sour cream]] in separate dishes so diners can assemble the tacos at the table\n===Variations===\nUse whatever filling ingredients that take your fancy, some other suggestions, sliced red onions, avocado, pickled chillies, crispy lettuce, pineapple chunks.\n===Chef's notes===\nThe [[Gressingham BBQ Pulled Duck]] (legs) are already pre-cooked. If you are using [[Fresh duck|fresh duck]] legs, they will will probably take about the same time, but the [[Oven|oven]] could do with being 1 little warmed (190\u00b0 C - 200\u00b0 C) and they will benefit from resting for 15 minutes once removed from the oven.\n\nThe cooking instructions on the [[Gressingham Pulled Duck]] suggests discarding all of the cooking juices after 25 minutes of [[Roasting|roasting]]. I would definitely suggest otherwise.  Next time I will mix them in with the [[Barbecue sauce|barbecue sauce]], and not waste them.\n\nI allowed the juices to solidify overnight and it was almost all lovely tasty jelly, hardly any [[Fat|fat]] - made a great [[Sandwich|sandwich]] filling and reminded me of jelly and [[Dripping|dripping]] of old.\n{{Tortillas-See also}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:North American recipes]]\n[[Category:Tex-Mex recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Spicy recipes]]\n[[Category:Fruit recipes]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n[[Category:Barbecue recipes]]\n[[Category:Poultry recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#duck #memphisbbqpulledducktacos #barbecuesauce #tacotrays #tacos #tacoshells #springonions #sourcream #sauce #fat #cherries </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"

We have a large Morphy Richards 6.5 litre slow cooker and a small chicken fitted easily, but I'm not so sure that a large one would fit.\n\n'''A little more environmentally friendly:''' Revisiting this recipe, the reason for the [[aluminium foil]] is just to stop the [[chicken]] overcooking should it make contact with the [[crockpot]]. It seems rather wasteful to use so much [[aluminium foil]] and then chuck it away afterwards so I looked for an alternative.  An ovenproof plate would be good but it has to be surprisingly small to fit in a slow cooker.  After a few experiments, a lattice of spoons worked the best. I still use a ball of [[aluminium foil]] on each side to hold the legs away from the edge of a cooker.\n\nYou could also rest the chicken on some [[carrots]], [[parsnips]] and [[onions]] which would serve the same purpose.\n==See also==\n* www.ibelieveicanfry.com/2013/04/slow-cooker-rotisserie-chicken.html\n* http://www.paleocupboard.com/slow-cooker-rotisserie-chicken.html\n* [[Slow cooker chicken (slow cooker recipe)]]\n* [[Roasting a turkey in a slow cooker]]\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:North American recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:Poultry recipes]]\n[[Category:Slow cooker recipes]]\n[[Category:I believe I can fry recipes]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n[[Category:Slow cooked]]\n[[Category:Recipes from other sites]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#chicken #aluminiumfoil #roastingachickeninaslowcooker #slowcooker #onion #oliveoil #freshherbs #tacoseasoning #heart #smokedpaprikapowder #liver </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"

However it is perfectly possible to slow cook a turkey crown, turkey breast or a turkey leg.\n\nIn the UK our local supermarket (Morrisons) sell a 1600g [3.5 lb] [[Turkey|turkey]] leg, separated into two pieces for just \u00a34.50, compared to \u00a324 for a turkey crown.  The leg is ideal for prolonged cooking and it '''''will''''' [[Roast|roast]] in the [[Slow cooker|slow cooker]].\n\nI've used a massive amount of [[Fresh herbs|fresh herbs]] from our garden to give this joint masses of flavour.\n\nThe [[Roasting|roasting]] occurs because the [[Turkey|turkey]] is kept out of the [[Stock|stock]] by sitting it on 5 or 6 balls of scrunched up [[Baking|baking]] [[Foil|foil]], a large [[Onion|onion]], halved and a bed of [[Herbs|herbs]].  I've used 500 ml of stock and 6 rashers of streaky [[Bacon|bacon]] to prevent the turkey from [[Drying|drying]] out.

If using the Nordic Ware tin, I suggest you paint the butter on with a [[Pastry|pastry]] [[Brush|brush]] to make sure you get into all the crevices.\n| Divide the mixture into the 6 moulds. If you fill to the last basket market, that should be about right.\n| [[Bake]] for about 20 minutes.\n| Leave in the tin for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a [[Cooling rack|cooling rack]] and allow to go completely cold.\n| The sponges should have an interior texture of a cross between normal sponge [[Cake|cake]] and a nicely [[Baked|baked]] scone. Do not expect them to be like a Victoria [[Sandwich]] as that type of sponge won\u00c2\u2019t be strong enough to hold the filling.\n| When cold, reserve the sponges until ready for use. They can go into an [[Airtight container|airtight container]] in the [[Fridge|fridge]] if necessary.\n}}\n====For the Cr\u00e8me  Diplomate (This will probably make more than you need)====\n{{RecipeMethod\n| This is made in two parts \u2013 the Cr\u00e8me P\u00e2tissi\u00e8re and the Cr\u00e8me Chantilly \u2013 which are then mixed together. You can either make it a 'set' version or an 'unset' one. The 'set' one requires the use of [[Gelatine|gelatine]] to set the Cr\u00e8me P\u00e2tissi\u00e8re, but I chose to do the 'unset' one, being a [[Vegetarian|vegetarian]]. It may be possible to use [[Agar|agar]]-agar as a setting agent, but this will need some experimentation because agar behaves differently to gelatine. I would make the Cr\u00e8me P\u00e2tissi\u00e8re first as that need to cool.\n}}\n====For the Cr\u00e8me P\u00e2tissi\u00e8re ====\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Hydrate the [[Gelatine|gelatine]] (if using).\n| Beat the [[Egg yolks|egg yolks]] with the [[Sugar|sugar]].\n| Whisk in the [[Cornflour|cornflour]].\n| Bring the [[Milk|milk]] to the [[Boil|boil]] in a [[Saucepan|saucepan]], the pour half of the milk over the [[Egg|egg]] mixture.\n| Whisk, return to the [[Saucepan|saucepan]] and heat, whisking thoroughly.\n| As the mixture thickens, carry on whisking.\n| When it returns to the [[Boil|boil]], cook for 45 seconds and remove from the heat.\n| Whisk in the [[Gelatine|gelatine]] (if using) and the [[Butter|butter]].\n| Cover and leave to cool.\n}}\n====For the Cr\u00e8me Chantilly====\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Whisk all of the ingredients in a chilled bowl until it has thickened.\n| Do not over-whisk or you will end up with sweet [[Butter|butter]].\n| Cover the bowl and keep in the [[Fridge|fridge]] until needed.\n}}\n====To mix the two====\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Whisk the cold Cr\u00e8me P\u00e2tissi\u00e8re.\n| Whisk in one-third of the Cr\u00e8me Chantilly, until smooth.\n| Fold in the remaining [[Cream|cream]] with a [[Spatula|spatula]].\n| Store in an [[Airtight container|airtight container]] the [[Fridge|fridge]] until needed, although it is easier to work with if used immediately\n}}\n====Assembly====\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Fill the sponge cases with the Diplomat Cream \u2013 if you have made the unset version, just [[Pile|pile]] it in. For set version, you can use a [[Piping bag|piping bag]].\n| Arrange [[Cherries|cherries]] or [[Fruit|fruit]] of your choice on the [[Cream|cream]].\n| Sprinkle with a little [[Icing Sugar|icing sugar]].\n}}\n===Chef's notes===\nIt is likely that you will have some of the Diplomat Cream left over.  This can be [[Frozen|frozen]] and used in other recipes.\n\nIf using a fan [[Oven|oven]] which does not allow the fan to be switched off, do the following:\n\nOnce you have put the mixture into the moulds, wrap some [[Tin foil|tin foil]] around the [[Baking|baking]] in. The sponges need to be protected from the fan, but you don\u00c2\u2019t want the [[Foil|foil]] to touch them. I made a sort of tent over the top, which helped to keep it free of the mixture and if possible, enclose the whole [[Baking tin|baking tin]] with foil, so that the fan doesn\u00c2\u2019t dry up the sponges.\n\nPlace in a COLD [[Oven|oven]], below the middle, but not at the bottom.\n\nSwitch the [[Oven|oven]] on to 160C and [[Bake|bake]] for about 35 minutes (!).\n\nRemove the [[Foil|foil]] and check that they are cooked. If not they can go back in without the foil covering.\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:North American recipes]]\n[[Category:Bread and baking]]\n[[Category:Sweets and desserts]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes]]\n[[Category:Fruit recipes]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#butter #fridge #gelatine #icingsugar #boil #airtightcontainer #foil #cherries #castersugar #saucepan #cream </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"

The basic idea is to carefully balance the chicken on a 3/4 full can of beer using its legs as an additional support, coat it with a flavoured rub and [[roast]] it.  The [[Steam|steam]] from the beer permeates the chicken to produce a succulent dish.  I think my [[Taco mix|taco mix]] suits this admirably, though any flavoured rub would do.\n\nOur American friends seem to barbecue chicken using this method, and though I'm sure it's worth trying, I can't believe that the upper part of the chicken would even get warm on our barbecue.  And we have a BIG barbecue.  I would welcome any feedback.\n\nThe process is made even easier and safer with one of these: [[Grillpro Stainless Steel Chicken Roaster]].\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 1.5kg free range [[Chicken|chicken]]\n| 6 tablespoons [[Taco mix|taco mix]], El Paso taco mix or a seasoning rub of your choice\n| 2 tablespoons [[Olive oil|olive oil]]\n| 440ml can of [[Beer|beer]] or [[Lager|lager]] \n| 1 [[tangerine]] or [[orange]] (optional)\n\n}}\n\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n* Preheat the oven to 200\u00b0 C (400\u00b0 F - Gas 6)\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Wash the outside of the beer can\n| [[Parson's nose|Remove the parson's nose]], any giblets, bags, tranklements etc. from the [[Chicken|chicken]] \n| Cut off and discard the [[Parson's nose]].\n| Rinse inside and out under cold running water and pat dry with kitchen towel\n| Rub 1 tablespoon of the [[Taco mix|taco mix]] into the cavity of the bird \n| Rub the outside of the [[Chicken|chicken]] with the [[Olive oil|olive oil]] and coat with 3 tablespoons of [[Taco mix|taco mix]]\n| Seal the neck of the bird by folding over and skewering with [[skewers]] or [[cocktail sticks]] \n| Open the [[Beer|beer]] and toast the start of the proceedings with about a &#188; of the beer - you don't want a full can\n| Punch a few holes around the empty top-part of the can\n| Add the remaining rub to the [[Beer|beer]] tin\n| Sit the [[Chicken|chicken]] on the [[Beer|beer]] can in a baking tray and balance it on its legs. A small chicken sits quite happily; a large chicken might be a bit trickier\n| Cut the top off the tangerine so the juice can run down while it cooks, affix with a [[cocktail stick]] into the top cavity (see photo) and add the cut slice as a hat!\n| Place the baking tray in the bottom of the oven\n| After 30 minutes, reduce the heat to 180\u00b0 C ( 350\u00b0 F - Gas 4)\n| The [[Chicken|chicken]] should be cooked in about 1.5 hours [total cooking timw], depending upon the size of the bird. Check every 15 minutes towards the end.  It is done when the juices run clear if the deepest part of the flesh (eg the thigh) is pierced with a metal skewer or sharp knife\n| Remove the [[Chicken|chicken]] extremely carefully with [[Oven gloves|oven gloves]] and tongs if needed.\n| Allow to rest for 10 minutes before carving\n}}\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Tex-Mex beercan chicken ready.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Oven-ready!\nImage:Tex-Mex beercan chicken ingredients.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The basic ingredients\n</gallery>\n===Serving suggestions===\nUsing [[The Jamie Oliver carving method|the Jamie Oliver carving method]], serve with [[roast potatoes]] and [[garlic mayonnaise]].\n\nThe remaining beer could be used to make gravy if needed.\n===Variations===\nTry this with a cock [[pheasant]] (hens are too small) and use [[cider]] or [[wine]] instead of [[beer]].  Wash out an empty 440 ml [[beer]] can and pour 330 ml of dry white [[wine]] or dry [[cider]] into it.  For this, a [[herb]] and [[Garlic|garlic]] rub is excellent - this can be made with the ingredients (minus the [[onion]] and [[pork]]) used in the [[Slow roast herby pork belly]] recipe.\n\nWe have also tried this with a small [[duck]], but the cavity was too large for the [[beer]] can, but not big enough for two cans.  Duckling might be worth a try if you can get it.\n===Chicken falls over?===\nMy chicken has just fallen over, I may have to get one of these: [http://www.socal.co.uk/BBQ_Accessories/Beer_Can_Chicken/Grillpro_Stainless_Steel_Chicken_Roaster/332/17302 (beer can) Chicken roaster]\n\nLarge chickens seem to be ok - it's the smaller birds that have problems balancing on a beer can.  440ml is probably the biggest can you should use with all but the largest birds. The last few times I have made this, I have placed the chicken and can inside an oven proof saucepan, in the oven, so the chicken has a little more support if it tends to lean over.  It also makes far less mess if it does fall over!\n\n... or go for the real thing: '''[[Grillpro Stainless Steel Chicken Roaster]]'''!\n{{Template:Beercan chicken - See also}}\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes|Chicken]]\n[[Category:Chilli pepper recipes|Chicken]]\n[[Category:Cooking with beer|Chicken]]\n[[Category:Main courses|Chicken]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes|Chicken]]\n[[Category:Poultry recipes|Chicken]]\n[[Category:Spicy recipes|Chicken]]\n[[Category:North American recipes]]\n[[Category:Tex-Mex recipes|Chicken]]\n[[Category:Cooking with wine]]\n[[Category:Favourite recipes]]\n[[Category:Student recipes]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#beer #chicken #texmexbeercanchicken #tacomix #oliveoil #wine #cider #cocktailstick #roastpotatoes #steam #orange </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"

It's easy, allows you to tailor it to your taste.  The recipe is easy to adjust to make different quantities.\n\nThe Main ingredients that give that authentic flavour are the [[oregano]], [[cumin seeds]] and [[chili powder]].  I would suggest you keep those at the levels here and adjust the other items if you have a desire to tinker.\n\nEverything is in teaspoons to make it easy to make different quantities - use tablespoons at the same rate to make more.\n===Commercially available Tex-Mex seasoning===\nI also use ready made seasoning mixes, but the one I had been using changed and was far too salty so I went in search of another supplier.  This let to my discovery of [[Taste Sensation Ltd]].  if you love your spices and seasonings, take a look at them.  They sell them directly and via [https://www.amazon.co.uk/stores/TasteSensation/node/4434351031 Amazon UK] and I can thoroughly recommend them.

Rub the mix on the [[meat]], coat well with a tablespoon of [[vegetable oil]] and 1 tablespoon [[lemon juice]] and marinate for 2 hours.\n\nI've recently discovered [[Old India Taco Seasoning]], which saves me from makling this.  It's sold in 500g quantities, which last us about 4 months!  Wonderful stuff.
