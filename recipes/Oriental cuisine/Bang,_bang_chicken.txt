If, like me, you are a lazy cook, slice it in a [[Food processor|food processor]]!\n| 1 serving of [[bang bang sauce]]\n| 1 tablespoon of [[Chili oil recipe (quick)|quick chili oil]]\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Place the [[Chicken|chicken]] in a small saucepan and just cover with water\n| Add the [[Garlic|garlic]], [[Peppercorns|peppercorns]] the [[Onion|onion]] and optionally, the [[bouquet garni]].\n| Bring to the [[Boil|boil]], skim off any scum. Cover and [[Simmer|simmer]] for 20-25 minutes\n| Remove the [[Chicken|chicken]] and pat dry with a clean [[Tea|tea]]-towel\n| (If making bang bang [[Sauce|sauce]], use 3 tablespoons of the cooking liquid to thin the [[Tahini|tahini]])\n| Freeze the remaining liquid as [[Chicken stock|chicken stock]]\n| Smash the [[Chicken|chicken]] breasts flat with a rolling-pin or the (clean) base of a large [[Frying pan|frying pan]]. Bang! Bang!\n| Shred the [[Chicken|chicken]] with two forks\n| Arrange the [[Chicken|chicken]] and [[Cucumber|cucumber]] on a serving dish and drizzle with [[bang bang sauce]] and [[Chili oil|chili oil]]\n}}\n===Variations===\nI love the combination of spring onions and cucumber, so, although not authentic, I like to add chopped spring onions to this dish, about 6 to go with 1 whole cucumber.\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Chinese recipes]]\n[[Category:Recipes|Spare ribs]]\n[[Category:Oriental cuisine]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:Poultry recipes]]\n[[Category:Spicy recipes]]\n[[Category:Favourite recipes]]\n[[Category:Boiled or simmered]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#chicken #bangbangsauce #cucumber #onion #bangbangchicken #garlic #bouquetgarni #unusualrecipes #tea #sauce #chickenstock </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
