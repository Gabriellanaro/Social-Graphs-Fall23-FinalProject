I re-cooked the meat a second time and have now left it for a month or so to 'mature'.  Well the still uncooked meat has seeped out into the wine, giving it a nice bloody-pink colour.  I did try some of the properly cooked meat and it was very tough and had an odd, almost unpleasant flavour.   Not wanting to waste the meat, I tried to use it for a [[Pork vindaloo|vindaloo curry]].  The curry sauce was delicious as always, the pork however was like pieces of wood. Inedible.  I don't have many failures, though this has to be a big one!  I'm sure a better cut of meat such as fillet would improve the texture, but as the flavour was dubious too, I wouldn't bother if I were you.\n\nI have left this recipe as a warning to others - Nasty, nasty, nasty. --[[User:Chef|Chef]] 16:34, 4 August 2009 (BST)\n\nAn unusual way to prepare pork. Slice thinly and serve with rice and a [[beansprout salad]].  It's pickled pork!\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 1.3 kg boneless rolled  [[Pork|pork]] cut into '''very thin slices''' (see follow-up notes below).\n| Freshly [[Ground|ground]] [[Szechuan peppercorns|szechuan peppercorns]] (use [[Black peppercorns|black peppercorns]] as a poor substitute)\n| 1 tablespoon [[Dark soy sauce|dark soy sauce]]\n| &frac12; tablespoon [[Sea Salt|sea salt]]\n| 2 [[Spring onions, chopped|spring onions, chopped]]\n| 2 [[Fat|fat]] [[Cloves|cloves]] of [[Garlic]], unpeeled and smashed (or to taste)\n| 1 whole [[Star anise|star anise]] [[Clove|clove]] (six petals)\n| 1 bottle of [[Dry white wine|dry white wine]]\n}}\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n| In a pan, just large enough to take the [[Pork|pork]], add the [[Spring onions|spring onions]], [[Salt|salt]], [[Pepper|pepper]], [[soy sauce]], [[garlic]] and [[Star anise|star anise]] and just cover with cold water\n| Bring to the [[Boil|boil]], cover and [[Simmer|simmer]] for 30 minutes or until properly cooked.\n| Remove the [[Pork|pork]], discard everything else\n| Pat the [[Pork|pork]] dry and leave to drain in a [[Colander|colander]], in the [[Refrigerator|refrigerator]] for 12 hours\n| Cut the [[Pork|pork]] into chunks and place in a [[Sterilised|sterilised]], screw-top-jar.\n| Add the [[Wine|wine]] wine, ensuring the [[Pork|pork]] is completely covered, seal and store in the [[Fridge|fridge]] for 2 weeks\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nDrain the [[Pork|pork]] and serve with a [[Beansprout salad|beansprout salad]] and [[Rice|rice]]\n\nI would suggest keeping the drained wine as a base for other meat-bases sauces.\n===Variations===\nUse a combination of [[onions]] / [[leeks]] / [[spring onions]]\n===Follow-up notes===\n\nMy first attempt was not cooked nearly well enough.  Even after a secondary cooking spell. After a month the blood from the underdone pork started to seep back into the wine.  It would be unsuitable as drunken pork, though it seems to be fine as a base for [[Pork vindaloo]]!\n\nSlice the pork ''very'' thinly next time.  It will also absorb more flavour from the wine.\n\n{{Template:ThinkPig}}\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes|Pork]]\n[[Category:Oriental cuisine|Pork]]\n[[Category:Main courses|Pork]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes|Pork]]\n[[Category:Pickles and preserves|Pork]]\n[[Category:Pork recipes]]\n[[Category:Cooking with wine|Pork]]\n[[Category:Boiled or simmered]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#pork #drunkenpork #staranise #springonions #garlic #porkvindaloo #beansproutsalad #boiledorsimmered #boil #simmer #ground </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
