Original ideas, brilliantly photographed as usual.\n  \nI'm not sure where you would buy  [[garlic chives]] in the UK.  Certainly not in big chain supermarkets, though I've seen them in specialist oriental supermarkets. \n\nI grow them from [[Seed|seed]] in the garden, they are easier to grow than [[Chives|chives]]. Where I've seen in the wild they are usually on boggy [[Ground|ground]] and growing in huge numbers.\n\nThe flavour is green and grassy with a hint of [[Garlic|garlic]].\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| &#189; tablespoon of [[Vegetable oil|vegetable oil]] for [[Frying|frying]]\n| 3 [[free range eggs]]\n| &#189; teaspoon [[Oyster sauce|oyster sauce]]\n| &#189; teaspoon [[nam-pla]]\n| &#189; teaspoon [[Sesame oil|sesame oil]]\n| 1 Tablespoon [[Shaoxing rice wine]]\n| 60g [[garlic chives]], chopped\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Heat the [[Vegetable oil|vegetable oil]] in a large [[Frying pan|frying pan]].\n| Mix the remaining ingredients in a small bowl and whisk well.\n| When the pan is nearly [[Smoking|smoking]], add the [[Egg|egg]]-mixture.\n| Using a fork pull the liquid edges towards the middle of the pan, jiggle the pan to re-distribute the liquid [[Egg|egg]].\n| Reduce the heat a little then sprinkle the [[Garlic|garlic]] [[Chives|chives]] over the [[Omelette|omelette]].\n| When the [[Egg|egg]] is almost cooked, fold in half, cut into slices and serve.\n}}\n\n{{OmeletteRecipes}}\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Chinese recipes]]\n[[Category:Oriental cuisine]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Snacks and light bites]]\n[[Category:Tapas, mezze and antipasti]]\n[[Category:Egg recipes]]\n[[Category:FotoosVanRobin recipes]]\n[[Category:Recipes from other sites]]\n[[Category:Pan fried]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#egg #garlicchiveomelette #garlicchives #vegetableoil #chives #garlic #smoking #shaoxingricewine #seed #unusualrecipes #frying </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
