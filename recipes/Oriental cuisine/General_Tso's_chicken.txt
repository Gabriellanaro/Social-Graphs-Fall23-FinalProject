The origins of the dish are unclear. The dish was previously largely unknown in China and other lands home to the Chinese. Thus, General Tso's [[Chicken]] is most likely an American invention in the history of American-Chinese food.\n\nThe association with General Tso, or Zuo Zongtang, a Qing dynasty general and statesman, is unclear. The dish is atypical of Hunanese cuisine, which is traditionally very spicy and rarely sweet. Instead, the dish is believed to have been introduced to New York City in the early 1970s as an example of Hunan and Szechuan-style cooking.\n\nThe dish was first mentioned in The New York Times in 1977. It has many similarities to [[Kung Po chicken]].\n\nPeng Chang-kuei, the 98 year old chef who created the much-loved Chinese dish General Tso's Chicken died on 4th December 2016 in Taipei, the capital of Taiwan.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 450 g (1 lb) boneless [[Chicken|chicken]] thighs cut into 2.5 cm (1\") cubes\n| 1 tablespoon [[Light soy sauce|light soy sauce]]\n| 1 beaten [[Egg|egg]]\n| [[Freshly ground black pepper]], to taste\n| 3 tablespoons of [[Cornflour|cornflour]]\n}}\n'''>[[Sauce]]:'''\n* 2 tablespoons [[Dark soy sauce|dark soy sauce]]\n* 1 tablespoon [[Black rice vinegar|black rice vinegar]]\n* 2 teaspoons Chinese [[Rice wine|rice wine]] or [[Dry sherry|dry sherry]]\n* 1 tablespoon [[Sugar|sugar]]\n* 3 tablespoons [[Chicken stock|chicken stock]] or water\n* 1 tablespoon minced [[Garlic|garlic]]\n* 1 tablespoon [[Minced|minced]] [[Ginger|ginger]]\n* 1 teaspoon [[Cornflour|cornflour]] for thickening\n'''>[[Stir-fry]]'''\n* 3 [[Spring onions|spring onions]], [[Chopped on the diagonal|chopped on the diagonal]]\n* 6 [[Dried|dried]] red birds' eye [[Chili peppers|chili peppers]] or to taste\n**[[Peanut]] or [[Vegetable oil|vegetable oil]] for [[Stir-frying|stir-frying]] and [[Deep frying|deep frying]]\n\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Mix the [[Egg|egg]], [[Soy sauce|soy sauce]], [[Pepper|pepper]] and [[Cornflour|cornflour]] to make a thin [[Batter|batter]] and coat the [[Chicken|chicken]] cubes.
