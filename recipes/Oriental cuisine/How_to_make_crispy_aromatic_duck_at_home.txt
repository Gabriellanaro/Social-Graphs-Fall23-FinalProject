You'll probably pay double and certainly won't have the selection of ingredients that you'll have if you follow my next suggestion.\n===Buy the ingredients from the same place as your Chinese take-away does===\n''This advice is specific to the United Kingdom, though I'm sure similar outlets exist throughout the world''.\n\nPay a visit to your local [[Chinese food wholesaler]].  There are chains of them throughout the UK and you don't need to be a member of any trade association to buy from them.  You may find them a little intimidating at first, but the staff are friendly and if you are into your food in a big way, you will find it a fascinating experience.  Most of them have a very good online presence so you can 'look before you buy'.  I guarantee that you will go back again and again.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 800g frozen pre cooked aromatic crispy duck [\u00a39.50]\n| 1 multi-pack 'pancakes for crispy duck' [ 102 pancakes, 17 packs (pre-packed in packs of 6) ]\n| 1 [[cucumber]]\n| 1 bunch [[spring onions]]\n| 50g 'Sauce for Peking Duck'\n\n}}\n\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n* Defrost a few packets of [[Chinese pancakes]]\n* Peel the [[cucumber]], quarter lengthwise and run a sharp knife along each quadrant to remove most of the seeds.\n* Top and tail the [[spring onions]]\n* Using a [[food processor]] with a metal blade, slice the [[cucumber]] and [[spring onions]].  It doesn't look as neat as [[julienning]] them, but it takes a quarter of the time and tastes just as good.\n* Chill the [[spring onions]] and [[cucumber]] in the [[refrigerator]] while the [[duck]] defrosts\n* Preheat the oven to 200\u00b0 C (400\u00b0 F - gas 6)\n\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Place the [[duck]] (skin-side down) on a rack over a [[roasting tray]] or a [[perforated roasting tray]] over a [[roasting tray]] - this will allow for the fat to drain off whilst the [[duck]] cooks.\n| Roast the [[duck]] for 45 minutes, turning once, carefully draining the roasting tray if it fills with [[fat]], otherwise you'll have a very smoky kitchen\n| You can [[steam]] the pancakes in a [[Chinese steamer]] over a [[wok]] or pan of boiling water for a few minutes - they only need to be warmed, not cooked.  I find they often stick together warming them this way so I prefer to separate the pancakes, spread them out on a large plate and [[microwave]] them for a minute or two to warm them.\n| Remove the [[duck]] from the oven, chop the skin into bite-sized pieces and then with two forks pulling against each other, shred the duck meat.\n}}\n===To serve===\nSpread a little of your favourite sauce on a pancake, cover with cucumber, spring onions & duck, roll the pancake up and eat with your fingers - delicious!\n===Variations===\nTry other sauces: [[Hoisin sauce]], [[Plum sauce]], [[chilli sauce]] and even [[mayonaise]] works very well!\n\nSliced white [[onions]] are a nice addition to [[spring onions]].\n\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes|Duck]]\n[[Category:Favourite recipes|Duck]]\n[[Category:Chinese recipes|Duck]]\n[[Category:Poultry recipes|Duck]]\n[[Category:Oriental cuisine|Duck]]\n[[Category:Main courses|Duck]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes|Duck]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n[[Category:Steamed]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#cucumber #springonions #duck #howtomakecrispyaromaticduckathome #foodprocessor #roastingtray #microwave #cheat #chinesepancakes #miseenplace #unusualrecipes </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
