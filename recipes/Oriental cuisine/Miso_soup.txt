Although the suspension of [[miso paste]] into [[dashi]] is the only characteristic that actually defines miso soup, many other ingredients are added depending on regional and seasonal recipes, and personal preference.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 750 ml (3 cups) [[dashi soup stock]]\n| 1 block [[Tofu|tofu]]\n| 3 tablespoons [[miso paste]]\n| 2 large or 4 small [[Spring onions, chopped|spring onions, chopped]]\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Add the [[dashi soup stock]] to a medium sized pan and bring to a [[Boil|boil]].\n| Reduce the heat to a [[Simmer|simmer]], cut the [[Tofu|tofu]] into small cubes and add them to the pan - don't allow the [[Soup|soup]] to [[Boil|boil]] once you have added the [[Tofu|tofu]].\n| [[Simmer]] for a few minutes.\n| Add a few tablespoons of the [[Soup|soup]] to a small bowl add the [[Miso|miso]] paste and stir well to mix the miso.\n| Little by little, add all of the [[Miso|miso]] mix back to the [[Soup|soup]], stirring as you do,.\n| Remove from the heat, add the [[Spring onions|spring onions]], divide into 4 bowls and serve.\n}}\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Oriental cuisine]]\n[[Category:Snacks and light bites]]\n[[Category:Soup and stock recipes]]\n[[Category:Fish recipes]]\n[[Category:Sea fish recipes]]\n[[Category:Boiled or simmered]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#misosoup #tofu #soup #misopaste #simmer #dashi #boil #dashisoupstock #miso #springonions #boiledorsimmered </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
