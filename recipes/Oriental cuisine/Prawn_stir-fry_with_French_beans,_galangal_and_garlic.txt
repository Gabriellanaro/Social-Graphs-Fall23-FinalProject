Just smash it with a cleaver to release the oils and then discard it when serving the meal.\n\nI made this for 2 but kept most of the quantities the same, apart from the soy sauce as 120ml seemed a lot.  I probably used 50ml.  It was delicious.  I may add more vegetables next time.\n{{Template:PeelingGinger}}\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Oriental cuisine]]\n[[Category:Vietnamese recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Shellfish recipes]]\n[[Category:Starters]]\n[[Category:Favourite recipes]]\n[[Category:Stir fried]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#prawns #prawnstirfrywithfrenchbeansgalangalandgarlic #galangal #marinade #beans #garlic #ghee #lemongrass #zest #wok #fishsauce </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
