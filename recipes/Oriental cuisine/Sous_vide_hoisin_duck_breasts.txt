I also added a teaspoon of Chinkiang black vice [[Vinegar|vinegar]] as I love its subtle flavour and in may [[Tenderise|tenderise]] the duck a little too.  It is likely that most of the vinegar is likely to be sucked out of the pouch during the vacuum process, so to this end I used enough plastic to make a pouch that would hang over the edge of the counter top whilst sealing, hopefully to lessen the effect.\n\nThis was a superb meal.  The duck breast was so tender you could have pushed your finger through it.  It had the flavour and mouthfeel of a rare duck breast, without all that blood.  Marvellous!\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| 310g [[Duck|duck]] breasts, skin on [2]\n| 2 teaspoons [[Hoisin sauce|hoisin sauce]]\n| 2 teaspoons Chinkiang [[Black rice vinegar|black rice vinegar]]\n}}\n''' to serve'''\n{{RecipeIngredientsNB\n| 1 packet prepared [[Stir fry|stir fry]] mix.
