Absolutely gorgeous!\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 2 tablespoons [[Groundnut oil|groundnut oil]]\n| 450 g (1 lb) [[Chicken livers]], rinsed, dried, trimmed and cut into bite-sized pieces.\n| 4 to 6 tablespoons of [[yellow cornmeal]].\n| 2 [[bell peppers|green bell peppers]], de-seeded and cut into chunks.\n| 4 slices of canned [[Pineapple|pineapple]] rings cut into chunks.\n| 4 tablespoons [[Chicken stock|chicken stock]].\n}}\n'''Sweet and sour sauce'''\n* 2 tablespoons [[Cornflour|cornflour]].\n* 100g (4 oz) [[White sugar|white sugar]].\n* 2 tablespoons [[Light soy sauce|light soy sauce]].\n* 120 ml (4 fl oz) [[White wine vinegar|white wine vinegar]].\n* 120 ml (4 fl oz) water.\n\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Add the [[cornmeal]] to a plate and roll the chicken livers around so they are well coated.\n| Heat the [[Oil|oil]] and [[Fry|fry]] the [[Chicken livers|chicken livers]] in batches until they are nicely [[Browned|browned]].  Set aside and keep warm.\n| Add the [[Peppers|peppers]] to the [[Wok|wok]] and [[Stir-fry|stir-fry]] for 4 minutes on a very high heat so they brown up a little.\n| Add the [[Stock|stock]] and the [[Pineapple|pineapple]] chunks, bring to the [[Boil|boil]], cover and [[Simmer|simmer]] for 4 minutes.\n| Mix the cornflour to a paste with a little of the water. Add to the remaining sweet and sour sauce ingredients and stir into the [[Wok|wok]], heat and allow to thicken.  It will turn all of a sudden. Once it has thickened, mix well and remove from the heat.\n| Pour the [[Sauce|sauce]] over the [[Chicken livers|chicken livers]].\n}}\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Sweet and sour chicken livers cornflour.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Thickened by the cornflour\nImage:Sweet and sour peppers.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Peppers browned, simmering in stock\n</gallery>\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe immediately with [[Plain boiled rice|plain boiled rice]].\n===variations===\nThe Chilli-heads amongst you, may like to add some [[Tabasco sauce]] or [[chilli oil]] to this just before serving.\n===Chef's note===\nDon't be alarmed by the quantity and liquidity of the sweet and sour sauce before it is cooked.  It will thicken up once cooked.\n\nI find that rolling the [[chicken livers]] in [[yellow cornmeal]] gives an nice crunchy texture, though it's probably not very authentic.\n==See also==\n* [[Sweet and sour recipes]]\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Oriental cuisine]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Offal recipes]]\n[[Category:Poultry recipes]]\n[[Category:Starters]]\n[[Category:Favourite recipes]]\n[[Category:Stir fried]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#sweetandsourchickenlivers #chickenlivers #yellowcornmeal #pineapple #wok #cornmeal #lightsoysauce #fry #bellpeppers #cornflour #fruit </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
