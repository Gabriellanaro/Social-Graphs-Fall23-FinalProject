Hers was an adapted version of [http://www.bbq-nl.com/2009/07/the-renowned-mr-brown.html the original] (''Dutch'').  I have further adapted [http://www.flickr.com/photos/fotoosvanrobin/6308694585/ hers].\n\nThe [[Meat|meat]] is great as a main meal with [[Vegetables|vegetables]] and [[potatoes]] or with a salad or even as a [[Sandwich|sandwich]] filler.  My favourite way is to have it as a [[Kebab|kebab]]-type filling in [[Pitta bread|pitta bread]] with [[Salad|salad]].\n\nI have included this in the North American recipe category as a homage to the original.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 1.3 kg (3 lb) boneless [[Pork shoulder|pork shoulder]].\n| 1 tablespoon coarsely [[Ground black pepper|ground black pepper]]\n| 1 tablespoon [[Smoked paprika powder|smoked paprika powder]]\n| 3 tablespoons [[Paprika powder|paprika powder]]\n| 4 tablespoons cane [[Sugar|sugar]]\n| 2 teaspoons [[Coarse sea salt|coarse sea salt]]\n| 2 teaspoons kona karashi (Japanese [[Mustard powder|mustard powder]])\n| 2 tablespoons [[Garlic powder|garlic powder]]\n| 1 tablespoon [[Ginger powder|ginger powder]]\n| 1 teaspoon [[Cayenne pepper|cayenne pepper]] or a [[Chilli powder|chilli powder]] mix of your choice\n| &#189; cup  [[Shaoxing rice wine]], [[Sherry|sherry]] or even spirit of your choice\n| 1 [[Onion|onion]], peeled and roughly chopped (or equivalent in [[Spring onions|spring onions]] or [[Leeks|leeks]])\n| 1 [[Apple|apple]], peeled, cored and cubed\n\n}}\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:The renowned Mr Brown Pulled Pork - Oriental slow roast.jpg|After 4 hours...\nImage:The renowned Mr Brown Pulled Pork - Oriental slow roast marinaded.jpg|Ready to cook\n</gallery>\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n* Preheat the [[Oven|oven]] to 160\u00b0 C (325\u00b0 F - gas 3), [fan oven 140\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Mix the [[Spices|spices]], cut deep slashes all over the meat and rub the mixture well into the pork.\n| Place in a [[Lock & Lock]]-style box and [[Refrigerate|refrigerate]] for 24 hours, shaking up now and again.\n| Chop the [[Apple|apple]] and [[Onion|onion]] and place in the base of a [[Baking|baking]] dish\n| Sit the [[Pork|pork]] on top, pour over the [[Wine|wine]] and add a little more rub to the top\n| Cover with [[Tin-foil|tin-foil]] and cook for 4 hours\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nShred with two forks and serve in [[Pitta breads|pitta breads]] with a [[Green salad|green salad]].\n===Chef's notes===\nIf you are not to use it all in one go, only shred what you will use straight away, store the remainder in the [[Refrigerator|refrigerator]], unshredded in a [[Lock & Lock box]].
