Following the original recipe, it was plain that there would not nearly enough liquid to cover the potatoes which meant that it could never be cooked on the hob. Adding more liquid to accommodate that would have turned it into soup.  \nI decided to oven cook it, except the oven broke down when I tried to use it, so the half finished dish had to be refrigerated and begun again the next day.  I decided to [[par boil]] the thinly sliced potatoes as I didn't want them to be undercooked.  Eventually it was a fantastic tasting (and looking) meal, but probably not as originally intended - the benefit of testing recipes first!\n\nThe recipe above is my modified version, you can see the original by viewing the ''history'' tab above.\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes|Fish stew]]\n[[Category:Latin American recipes|Fish stew]]\n[[Category:Paraguayan recipes|Fish stew]]\n[[Category:Main courses|Fish stew]]\n[[Category:Fish recipes|Fish stew]]\n[[Category:Freshwater fish recipes|Fish stew]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#fish #onions #oliveoil #fishstock #garlic #lemonjuice #parboil #unusualrecipes #sweetpeppers #whitefish #vegetables </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
