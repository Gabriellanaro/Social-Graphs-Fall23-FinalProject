Unlike the cornbread typical of the southern United States, broa is made from a mixture of [[Cornmeal|cornmeal]] and [[Wheat|wheat]] or [[Rye flour|rye flour]], and is [[Leavened|leavened]] with [[Yeast|yeast]] rather than [[Baking powder|baking powder]] or [[Baking soda|baking soda]].\n\nThis yeast bread has the wholesome rustic flavour and texture that suitably accompanies soups, especially [[Caldo Verde]], the Portuguese green soup made with tender [[kale]], [[potatoes]], and [[chouri\u00e7o sausages]]. It has a wonderful crunchy crust when freshly baked.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 2 teaspoons [[Dried active yeast|dried active yeast]]\n| 150 ml (1/4 pint) tepid [[Milk|milk]]\n| 200 ml (7 fl oz) tepid water\n| 200 g [[Yellow cornmeal|yellow cornmeal]]\n| 300 g (10 oz) [[Strong white flour|strong white flour]]\n| 1 level teaspoon of [[Salt|salt]]\n| 1 tablespoon [[Olive oil|olive oil]]\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Add the ingredients to your [[Breadmaker|breadmaker]].\n| Set to Whole wheat - Bake rapid [[Panasonic SD253 breadmaker]]\n| Use menu 05 ''Whole wheat rapid bake'' (3 hours) on [[Panasonic SD-ZB2502 automatic breadmaker]]\n|* Ideally: 15 min rest / 25 min [[Kneading bread|knead]] / 1:40 min rise / 45 min [[Bake|bake]]\n| Remove and cool on a wire tray once [[Baking|baking]] is complete.\n}}\n===Variations===\nPlease [[Talk:Broa|discuss other bake setting here]].\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Bread and baking]]\n[[Category:Breadmaker recipes]]\n[[Category:Portuguese recipes]]\n[[Category:Snacks and light bites]]\n[[Category:Spanish recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#broa #baking #driedactiveyeast #kneadingbread #ryeflour #panasonicsd253breadmaker #kale #bakingpowder #yeast #bake #potatoes </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
