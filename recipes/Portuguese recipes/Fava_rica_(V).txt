They are often labelled as [[Fava beans|fava beans]].\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 450 g [[Dried|dried]] [[Broad beans|broad beans]]\n| [[Garlic]] to taste, finely [[Diced|diced]]\n| 60 ml [[Olive oil|olive oil]]\n| 1 tablespoon [[White wine vinegar|white wine vinegar]]\n| Seasoning\n\n}}\n\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n* Soak the [[Beans|beans]] for a minimum of 15 hours in cold water.\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Drain and rinse the [[Beans|beans]], and [[Boil|boil]] in [[Salted|salted]] water until cooked. \n| Leaving the [[Beans|beans]] in the cooking water, gently [[Fry|fry]] the [[Garlic|garlic]] in the [[Olive oil|olive oil]] until golden.  Use a deepish pan for this.\n| Whilst the [[Garlic|garlic]] is cooking, drain the [[Beans|beans]] and then mix them with the garlic and [[Oil|oil]], together with the [[Wine vinegar|wine vinegar]].\n| [[Mash]] some (not all) of the [[Beans|beans]] and [[Boil|boil]] for a few minutes.\n| Serve hot.\n}}\n===Variations===\nAlthough not so authentic, you can add other flavourings such as [[Herbs|herbs]], [[Spices|spices]] or [[Lemon juice|lemon juice]].\n===Chef's notes===\nWhen looking for the [[Dried|dried]] [[Broad beans|broad beans]], make sure they are brownish-green and labelled as dried broad [[Beans|beans]] or [[Fava beans|fava beans]].
