It is traditionally made with [[La Gomera|Queso de la Gomera]], an unpasteurised goats\u2019 cheese, which may be difficult to source outside of the Canaries.  [[TuCanarias]] can supply [[Queso de la Gomera]] though the postage costs may be prohibitive.\n\nThe word \"[[Almogrote]]\" does not even appear in [[Spanish]] dictionaries, although it is probably derived from the word \"almodrote\": a [[Sauce|sauce]] made from [[Oil|oil]], [[Garlic|garlic]] and other ingredients. Almogrote is always made using a [[Mortar and pestle|mortar and pestle]] - a basic wooden mortar and pestle.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 500 g mature [[Goats|goats]] [[Cheese|cheese]]\n| 4 tablespoons of [[paprika]]\n| 1 whole [[Red chilli pepper|red chilli pepper]] with [[Seeds|seeds]]\n| 1 cup of [[Olive oil|olive oil]]\n| 10 [[Garlic cloves, peeled and crushed|garlic cloves, peeled and crushed]]\n| 300g [[tomatoes]], (optional)\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Chop the ingredients into small pieces\n| Grind the pieces to a paste using a large wooden [[Mortar and pestle|mortar and pestle]].\n}}\n===Type of cheese to use===\nOriginally, in a discussion with another editor, the oft-seen suggestion to use a 'hard' cheese for this recipe was possibly attributed to a (mis)-translation \"Sometimes the Spanish word 'duro' which means 'hard' can also mean 'mature' in cheese terms\", however the following quote was found:\n\n''Si hace falta martillo y escoplo para ello, el queso es el ideal'', [If you need a hammer and chisel for it, the cheese is the ideal (one)].\n\nSo the plot thickens!
