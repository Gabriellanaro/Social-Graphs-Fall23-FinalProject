It is traditional to use a cheese such as a mature [[Queso de la Gomera cheese|La Gomera]], but any strong, hard cheese will be fine.\n\n'''To [[Roast|roast]] the [[Tomatoes|tomatoes]]'''\n{{RecipeIngredientsTM\n| 6 ripe [[Tomatoes|tomatoes]] (about 425g), cut in half\n| 4 tablespoons [[Olive oil|olive oil]]\n| [[Sea Salt|sea salt]] or pink Himalayan [[Rock salt|rock salt]]\n}}\n'''To make the [[Almogrote|almogrote]]'''\n{{RecipeIngredientsNB\n| 8 large [[Cloves|cloves]] [[Garlic|garlic]], peeled\n| 1-2 [[Guindilla peppers|guindilla peppers]]\n| 140g hard, mature, strong [[Cheese|cheese]], broken into chunks\n| The [[Roasted tomatoes|roasted tomatoes]], drained (reserve the [[Oil|oil]])\n| 90g [[Stock|stock]] of your choice\n| The reserved [[Olive oil|olive oil]], made up to 120ml\n}}\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n* Preheat the [[Oven|oven]] to its highest setting.\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Arrange the [[Tomatoes|tomatoes]] in a [[Roasting tin|roasting tin]], cut side up.\n| Drizzle the [[Oil|oil]] over them and lightly sprinkle with the [[Salt|salt]].\n| Place in the [[Oven|oven]] for 15 minutes, reduce the heat to 150\u00b0 C (300\u00b0 F - gas 2), [fan oven 130\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour] and continue [[Roasting|roasting]] for a further 1&frac12; hours, by which time the [[Tomatoes|tomatoes]] should have shrunk to half their original size.\n| Allow the [[Tomatoes|tomatoes]] to cool thoroughly or even leave them in the [[Fridge|fridge]] overnight.\n| Place the [[Garlic|garlic]], and [[Guindilla peppers|guindilla(s)]] in the TM bowl and process '''10 seconds / Speed 5'''.\n| Scrape down the inside of the bowl and add the [[Cheese|cheese]].\n| Process '''1 minute / Speed 5-10 progressively'''.\n| Add the [[Tomatoes|tomatoes]] and the [[Stock|stock]] and [[Blend|blend]] at '''Speed 5''' until you have the consistency of a paste.\n| Ensure the '''MC''' has open end upright and slowly pour the [[Oil|oil]] onto the lid of bowl, running at '''Speed 5''' until all the oil has been emulsified.\n| Continue blending until you have the desired consistency - I like mine with a bit of texture although you can make it as smooth as you like.\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe with [[Boiled potatoes|boiled potatoes]] or papas arrugados, [[Hard boiled eggs|hard boiled eggs]] or simply spread it on [[Bread|bread]] or toast.  It can also be used as a [[Dip|dip]].\n===Recipe source===\n* The recipe is based on one in '''''Canarias - cocina tradicional''''' by Vicente Sanchez Ara\u00f1a (ISBN 9788444120157).  It has been translated, adapted and converted for [[Thermomix]].\n===Chef's notes===\nI doubled the ingredients listed in the original recipe, because I am a pig.  Also the [[Roasting|roasting]] of the [[Tomatoes|tomatoes]] was my idea, to add extra flavour, but there is no need to do so.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Almogrote]] and [[Talk:Almogrote|Almogrote - the non-authentic version]]\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Spanish recipes]]\n[[Category:Accompaniments]]\n[[Category:Dips and sauces]]\n[[Category:Spicy recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes]]\n[[Category:Cheese recipes]]\n[[Category:Chilli pepper recipes]]\n[[Category:Garlic recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegetable recipes]]\n[[Category:Thermomix recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#tomatoes #garlic #cheese #roasting #stock #oliveoil #almogrote #bread #thermomix #thermomixrecipes #fridge </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
