My husband and daughter enjoyed this in a restaurant near to the city of [[Antequera]] (M\u00e1laga). There are many variations of this recipe so I have tried to re create it as near as I can to that which they ate. The orginal had [[goat]] instead of [[lamb]], but it is not easy to come by in the UK.  However, our butcher said he can get it for us.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 45 ml [[Olive oil|olive oil]]\n| 1 kg [[Potatoes|potatoes]], peeled and cut into slices\n| 2 large [[Carrots|carrots]], peeled and sliced\n| 2 large [[Onions|onions]], peeled and sliced\n| [[Garlic]] to taste, [[Diced|diced]] - we used 2 bulbs\n| 1 kg in total of [[Chicken breast|chicken breast]], [[Pork tenderloin|pork tenderloin]] and [[Shoulder|shoulder]] of [[Lamb|lamb]]\n| 1 [[Red pepper|red pepper]], chopped\n| 1 teaspoon [[Cumin seeds|cumin seeds]]\n| 2 tablespoons sweet [[Smoked paprika|smoked paprika]] (Piment\u00f3n de la Vera), or to taste\n| A few [[saffron]] strands, crushed with a [[pestle and mortar]]\n| 1 large [[Tomato|tomato]], skinned\n| 1.3 lites (approx) [[Stock]] or water\n| 200 g [[Long grain rice|long grain rice]]\n| 1 tablespoon [[Breadcrumbs|breadcrumbs]]\n| 40 g [[Ground almonds|ground almonds]]\n| 125 ml manzanilla or very [[Dry sherry|dry sherry]]\n| Seasoning\n| 2 [[Eggs, hard-boiled|eggs, hard-boiled]] and cut into slices\n| [[Parsley]], chopped\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Heat the [[Oil|oil]] in a large deep pan and [[Saute|saute]] the [[Potatoes|potatoes]] and [[Carrots|carrots]] until they are golden.\n| Remove them from the pan and reserve.\n| [[Fry]] the [[Onions|onions]] and [[Garlic|garlic]] in the same pan until soft, then add the [[Meats|meats]].\n| Cook until the [[Meats|meats]] are sealed.\n| Add the [[Pepper|pepper]] and cook for a minute or so then stir in the [[Cumin|cumin]], [[Paprika|paprika]] and [[saffron]], cooking for a further 30 seconds.\n| Mix in the [[Tomato|tomato]], and return the [[Potatoes|potatoes]] and [[Carrots|carrots]] to the pan and add enough hot [[Stock|stock]] or water to cover.  \n| Add more [[Stock|stock]] or water as needed throughout the cooking process.\n| Bring to the [[Boil|boil]] and [[Simmer|simmer]] until about 15 minutes before you think the [[Meat|meat]] will be done, then add the [[Rice|rice]], [[Breadcrumbs|breadcrumbs]], [[Almonds|almonds]] and [[Sherry|sherry]]. \n| Cover and cook for a further 15 minutes.\n| Check seasoning and serve, garnished with the [[Egg|egg]] slices and [[Parsley|parsley]].\n}}\n===Variations===\nSome variations use just [[pork]] or [[lamb]], but would be a mixture of, for example, [[heart]], [[liver]] and flesh.  The version from C\u00f3rdoba uses [[pork tenderloin]], whole [[chicken]] pieces, [[morcilla]] and [[chorizo]].\n===Chef's notes===\nRemember to make sure the liquid does not evaporate too much or it will stick to the pan.  It should have a thickish consistency though.  By the way, the verdict was that it is very, very similar to that meal in Antequera!\n==See also==\n* {{See also - Jointing a chicken}}\n{{Template:ThinkPig}}\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes|Chanfaina]]\n[[Category:Egg recipes|Chanfaina]]\n[[Category:Garlic recipes|Chanfaina]]\n[[Category:Lamb recipes|Chanfaina]]\n[[Category:Main courses|Chanfaina]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes|Chanfaina]]\n[[Category:Pork recipes|Chanfaina]]\n[[Category:Poultry recipes|Chanfaina]]\n[[Category:Rice recipes|Chanfaina]]\n[[Category:Spanish recipes|Chanfaina]]\n[[Category:Stews and casseroles|Chanfaina]]\n[[Category:Cooking with wine|Chanfaina]]\n[[Category:Boiled or simmered]][[Category:Pan fried]]\n\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#chanfaina #carrots #potatoes #stock #lamb #tomato #onions #porktenderloin #breadcrumbs #meats #saffron </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
