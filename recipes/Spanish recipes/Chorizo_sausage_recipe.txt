I have not tried drying or [[Preserving|preserving]] them in any way, though I guess it would be possible with this recipe. For this reason, I don't bother to get the casings, I just make the [[sausages]] like patties or burgers.\n\nUse these in [[:Special:Whatlinkshere/Chorizo_sausage|any recipe that calls for chorizo sausages]]\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 1.5 tablespoons [[Sherry vinegar|sherry vinegar]]\n| 1 large [[Dried|dried]] [[Poblano|poblano]] [[Chili|chili]], stalk removed\n| 4 fresh [[Habanero|habanero]] [[Chillies|chillies]], stlaks removed or 3 teaspoons hot [[Chili powder|chili powder]]\n| 675 g (1.5 lb) lean [[Pork|pork]] ([[Pork fillet|pork fillet]] is good here) , chopped coarsely\n| 1 tablespoon fresh [[Coriander leaves|coriander leaves]], chopped\n| 6 [[Garlic cloves, peeled and crushed|garlic cloves, peeled and crushed]]\n| 1 tablespoon [[Paprika powder|paprika powder]] or [[Smoked paprika powder|smoked paprika powder]] if you can find it\n| 1 teaspoon freshly [[Ground cinnamon|ground cinnamon]]\n| &#188; teaspoon [[Ground cloves|ground cloves]]\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Add the [[Spices|spices]], [[Chillies|chillies]] and the [[Vinegar|vinegar]] to a small [[Blender|blender]] attachment and grind to a paste.  A [[Mortar and pestle|mortar and pestle]] will do the job, just takes a bit more work!\n| Add the [[Pork|pork]] and the [[Spice|spice]] paste to a [[Food processor|food processor]] and pulse blend until you have a coarse mix.  Don't overdo this or you will end up with [[Pate|pate]] which is not what you need\n| Roll into [[Sausage|sausage]] shapes or flat patties\n| Preheat the oven to 190\u00b0 C (375\u00b0 F - gas 5)\n| Cook for 20 minutes on a lightly oiled oven tray\n| Verify the [[Meat|meat]] is cooked properly as it is [[Pork|pork]] remember\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe hot or cold\n\n===Variations===\nAdjust the amount of [[Chili|chili]] to your personal taste.  I like mine quite hot.\n===Chef's notes===\n{{Template:ThinkPig}}\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Chilli pepper recipes]]\n[[Category:Garlic recipes]]\n[[Category:Historic recipes]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:Pork recipes]]\n[[Category:Spicy recipes]]\n[[Category:Tex-Mex recipes]]\n[[Category:Spanish recipes]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#pork #chili #chillies #poblano #porkfillet #groundcinnamon #smokedpaprikapowder #chorizosausages #vinegar #chilipowder #blender </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
