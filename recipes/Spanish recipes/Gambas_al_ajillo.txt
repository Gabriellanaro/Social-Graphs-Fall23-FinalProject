This could be a [[tapas]] dish, a [[starter]], or if you doubled the amount, a [[main course]].\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 450g (1 lb) fresh peeled [[prawns]]\n| 4 cloves [[Garlic|garlic]], crushed\n| 1 teaspoon hot [[chili flakes]]\n| 1 teaspoon [[smoked paprika]] powder (normal [[paprika powder]] will do)\n| 4 tablespoons [[dry sherry]]\n| 3 tablespoons freshly chopped [[parsley]]\n| Juice of 1 [[lemon]]\n| [[Olive oil]]\n| 1 [[lime]], quartered\n| [[Sea salt]] and freshly [[ground black pepper]]\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Cut each slice down the centre of the back of each [[prawn]].  This will enable you to remove the bitter black 'backbone' and will allow the [[prawn]] to  curl open when cooked.\n| Add 2 or 3 good glugs of [[olive oil]] to a large frying pan over a medium heat\n| When the oil is hot, but not smoking, add the [[Garlic|garlic]] and [[chili flakes]] and saut\u00e9 for a few minutes so the oil is nicely flavoured. Don't burn the garlic or you will need to start again!\n| Turn up the heat and add the [[sherry]], [[lemon juice]], [[paprika powder]] and the [[prawns]], stirring until the [[prawns]] change colour and curl. This should take about 3 minutes\n| Arrange in a bowl and garnish with the chopped [[parsley]]\n| Season with [[sea salt]] and freshly [[ground black pepper]]\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe with freshly baked [[bread]] and [[lime]] quarters\n[[Image:Boiled chickpeas.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Plain boiled [[chickpeas]] are a great way of adding healthy fibre to this dish]]\nIn a nod towards the recent report that [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-46827426 we are not eating enough lifesaving fibre], we have started to add plain boiled [[chickpeas]] to lots of our meals.\nThis recipe is ideally suited to such an addition.  Just drop a fistfull of cooked chickpeas into the bowl as you serve the garlic prawns.  The bland-nuttiness works extremely well with the garlic oil.\nIt's worth trying, drained, canned [[chickpeas]] would be just as good as freshly cooked chickpeas. \n\n===Variations===\n\nThis can be made will unpeeled [[prawns]] or even [[defrosted]] frozen [[king prawns]].\n==See also==\n* [[Menorcan garlic prawns]]\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes|Prawn]]\n[[Category:Accompaniments|Prawn]]\n[[Category:Chilli pepper recipes|Prawn]]\n[[Category:Fish recipes|Prawn]]\n[[Category:Garlic recipes]]\n[[Category:Shellfish recipes|Prawn]]\n[[Category:Main courses|Prawn]]\n[[Category:Spicy recipes|Prawn]]\n[[Category:Starters|Prawn]]\n[[Category:Snacks and light bites|Prawn]]\n[[Category:Spanish recipes]]\n[[Category:Tex-Mex recipes|Prawn]]\n[[Category:Tapas,_mezze_and_antipasti|Prawn]]\n[[Category:Pan fried]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#gambasalajillo #prawns #chickpeas #parsley #groundblackpepper #chiliflakes #garlic #lime #paprikapowder #prawn #oliveoil </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
