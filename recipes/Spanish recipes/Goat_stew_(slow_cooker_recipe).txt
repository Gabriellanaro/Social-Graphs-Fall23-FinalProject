It is recommend that you cook goat on the bone, even for [[Stews|stews]], for better flavour\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| 1kg [[Goat|goat]] [[Meat|meat]], with bone, chopped into largish chunks (see note below)\n| 2 tablespoons mild Piment\u00f3n de La Vera (or other [[Smoked paprika|smoked paprika]])\n| [[Olive oil]]\n| 4 [[Spanish]] [[Onions|onions]], sliced\n| [[Garlic]], to taste, peeled and chopped\n| 1.2 [[Litres|litres]] hot [[Beef Stock|beef stock]]\n| 500g or more [[New Potatoes|new potatoes]], halved\n| 250ml [[Red wine|red wine]]\n| 2 [[Red peppers|red peppers]], roughly chopped\n| 2 large or 4 small [[Courgettes|courgettes]], sliced\n| 1 large or 2 small [[Aubergines|aubergines]], chopped\n| 15 [[Black olives]]\n| 80g [[Raisins|raisins]]\n| [[Salt]] and [[Pepper|pepper]]\n| [[Mint]]\n}}\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n\n* Rub the [[Goat|goat]] [[Meat|meat]] with the Piment\u00f3n de La Vera, place in a bowl, cover and  leave overnight or for 12 hours in the [[Fridge|fridge]]\n\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| Whilst the [[Goat|goat]] is [[Marinating|marinating]], heat some [[Olive oil|olive oil]] in a [[Casserole|casserole]] or [[Frying pan|frying pan]].\n| Add the [[Onions|onions]] and gently [[Fry|fry]] until [[Caramelised|caramelised]] - a pinch each of [[Sugar|sugar]] and [[Salt|salt]] will [[Help|help]] with this.  The longer it takes, the better the flavour.\n| Towards the end of the cooking time, add the [[Garlic|garlic]].\n| Pre-heat your [[Slow cooker|slow cooker]] according to the manufacturer's instructions - about 20 minutes.\n| Tip the [[Onion|onion]] mixture into the [[Slow cooker|slow cooker]].\n| Using the same pot or pan that you used for the [[Onions|onions]], heat a little more [[Olive oil|olive oil]] to high.\n| Add the [[Goats|goats]] chunks, a few at a time for just long enough to [[Sear|sear]] the outside.\n| Transfer to the [[Slow cooker|slow cooker]] and add the hot [[Stock|stock]], [[Potatoes|potatoes]] and [[Red wine|red wine]]\n| Cook on 'high' for 2-3 hours\n| Add the [[Peppers|peppers]], [[Courgettes|courgettes]], [[Aubergines|aubergines]], [[Olives|olives]] and [[Raisins|raisins]] and cook for a further 2-3 hours\n| Season to taste and serve, garnished with chopped [[Mint|mint]]\n}}\n===Variations===\nYou can use any combination of [[Vegetables|vegetables]], but just make sure that any hard ones, eg [[Carrots|carrots]] are added at the beginning\n===Chef's notes===\nI advise you to get the [[Meat|meat]] chopped by the [[Supplier|supplier]], rather than do it yourself, which I understand can be very tricky to get right\n\nYou can cook this on 'low' if you like.  I have not tested it, but would suggest a total of 8 hours cooking at least.\n\nIf you are not going to be around to add the [[Vegetables|vegetables]] half way through cooking, you can put them all in at the beginning.\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Spanish recipes]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:Cooking with wine]]\n[[Category:Slow cooker recipes]]\n[[Category:Stews and casseroles]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n[[Category:Pan fried]]\n[[Category:Slow cooked]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#goat #oliveoil #onions #slowcooker #vegetables #courgettes #mint #garlic #aubergines #redwine #raisins </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
