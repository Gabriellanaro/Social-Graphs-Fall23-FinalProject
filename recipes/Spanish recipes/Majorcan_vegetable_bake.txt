I've increased the [[Garlic|garlic]] from a measly 2 [[Cloves|cloves]] in the original recipe to about 6 as I can't imagine any self-respecting Spaniard ever putting just 2 Cloves of [[Garlic|garlic]] in a dish to serve 6 people!\n\nBe bold, vary the [[Vegetable|vegetables]] to match what you have lying around at the time.\n\nThis was a very nice, and very easy vegetable dish, it will be made again.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 400g can peeled [[Plum tomatoes|plum tomatoes]], chopped\n| 1 tablespoon fresh [[Oregano|oregano]] or [[Marjoram|marjoram]], chopped\n| 3 tablespoons of [[Olive oil|olive oil]] plus a little more to dress the dish with\n| 6 [[Fat|fat]] Cloves of [[Garlic|garlic]] (or to taste), half peeled and crushed, the remaining half peeled and roughly chopped\n| 1 [[Aubergine|aubergine]], sliced\n| 1 [[Sweet bell pepper|sweet bell pepper]] of any colour\n| 1 large [[Onion|onion]], peeled and sliced\n| 650g [[Potatoes|potatoes]], peeled and sliced: Desiree, King Edward, Lady Balfour, Maris Piper, Melody etc.\n| [[Sea Salt|sea salt]] and [[Freshly ground black pepper|freshly ground black pepper]]\n}}\n\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n* Preheat the [[Oven|oven]] to  200\u00b0 C (400\u00b0 F - gas 6), [fan oven 180\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Add 1.5  tablespoons of the [[Oil|oil]] to a pan and sizzle the [[Garlic|garlic]] for a minute and then add the [[Tomatoes|tomatoes]], [[Oregano|oregano]], season and [[Simmer|simmer]] for 10 minutes to reduce a little.\n| Toss the [[Aubergine|aubergine]], [[Pepper|pepper]] and [[Onion|onion]] in the remaining [[Oil|oil]], season and arrange in a [[Baking tray|baking tray]] and [[Oven|oven]] [[Roast|roast]] for 10 minutes.\n| Remove from the [[Oven|oven]] and arrange the [[Potatoes|potatoes]] and [[Vegetables|vegetables]] in layers.\n| Pour over the [[Tomato sauce|tomato sauce]], add a grind of [[Black pepper|black pepper]] and a glug of [[Olive oil|olive oil]]. \n| Cover with [[Tin foil|tin foil]] and [[Bake|bake]] for 1 hour, removing the [[Tin-foil|tin-foil]] half way through.\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe with crusty [[Bread|bread]].\n===Chef's notes===\nNever one to resist playing around, I added 1/2 a glass of [[red wine]] and a big pinch of [[chilli flakes]] to the [[tomato sauce]].\n\nI think that in future I would finish under a grill to really crisp up the potatoes.\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Spanish recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Vegan recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes]]\n[[Category:Garlic recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegetable recipes]]\n[[Category:Favourite recipes]]\n[[Category:Student recipes]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#garlic #majorcanvegetablebake #oregano #potatoes #oliveoil #onion #aubergine #tomatosauce #vegetarian #bread #sidedish </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
