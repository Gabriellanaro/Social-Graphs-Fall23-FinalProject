Because of all the lovely [[Garlic|garlic]] and [[Chilli|chilli]] flavoured [[Oil|oil]], it tempts you to eat far too much [[Bread|bread]]. This version is as close as I could get to the best we had while there.  Increase or reduce the garlic and chilli to taste. 1 bulb of garlic would be my personal choice!\n\nGood fresh [[Bread|bread]] is an essential [[Accompaniment|accompaniment]] to this dish.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| 300g large fresh raw [[Peeled prawns|peeled prawns]] ([[King prawns|king prawns]])\n| 125 ml [[Extra virgin olive oil|extra virgin olive oil]]\n| 3 small dried red [[chillies]], such as [[bird eye chillies]]\n| &#189; teaspoon [[Sea Salt|sea salt]]\n| 1 bulb of [[garlic]] broken into cloves, peeled and sliced\n}}\n'''to serve'''\n{{RecipeIngredientsNB\n| A little chopped fresh [[Parsley|parsley]]\n| 1 [[Lemon|lemon]] cut into [[Wedges|wedges]]\n| Freshly [[Baked|baked]] [[Brown bread|brown bread]]\n}}\n\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| Heat the [[Oil|oil]] over a medium heat, in a small pan. Not too hot, burnt [[Garlic|garlic]] is nasty.\n| Add \u00bd a teaspoon of salt to the oil and then add the [[Dried Chillies|dried chillies]] and the sliced [[Garlic|garlic]] and let them sizzle.\n| The very second you see the garlic take the slightest colour add all of the [[Prawns|prawns]]\n| Carefully stir until the [[Prawns|prawns]] turn pink\n| Be careful not to overcook the garlic.  You want it soft and juicy, not crisp and dry.\n| Pour the contents of the pan into a pre-warmed [[Oven|oven]]-proof dish, or serve from the pan on a wooden board\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nSprinkle the chopped [[Parsley|parsley]] over the [[Brown bread|brown bread]] and serve this [[Tapa|tapa]] with [[Lemon wedges|lemon wedges]]\n===Recipe source===\n\n* A glorious Menorcan holiday\n===Variations===\nMy preference for the [[chillies]] is to use 3 large dried [[Chile de Arbole]], cut into small pieces.  This way, the oil gets properly flavoured and you have lots of lovely garlic flavoured chillies to eat - I do like my chillies to have a little bite!\n==See also==\n* [[Gambas al Ajillo]]\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Spanish recipes]]\n[[Category:Accompaniments]]\n[[Category:Snacks and light bites]]\n[[Category:Spicy recipes]]\n[[Category:Starters]]\n[[Category:Tapas, mezze and antipasti]]\n[[Category:Chilli pepper recipes]]\n[[Category:Fish recipes]]\n[[Category:Sea fish recipes]]\n[[Category:Shellfish recipes]]\n[[Category:Pan fried]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#garlic #brownbread #menorcangarlicprawns #parsley #bread #prawns #tapa #chillies #panfried #gambasalajillo #wedges </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
