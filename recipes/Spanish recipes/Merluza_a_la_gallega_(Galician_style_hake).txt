Steaks have [[bones]] which keep the flesh together better.\n\nI think it is best to use a non-[[Smoked paprika|smoked paprika]] for this dish.  [[Paprika#Piment\u00f3n de Murcia|Piment\u00f3n de Murcia]] is probably the best [[Spanish]] variety.\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes|Hake]]\n[[Category:Fish recipes|Hake]]\n[[Category:Garlic recipes|Hake]]\n[[Category:Main courses|Hake]]\n[[Category:Sea fish recipes|Hake]]\n[[Category:Spanish recipes|Hake]]\n[[Category:Boiled or simmered]]\n[[Category:Pan fried]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#hake #potatoes #garlic #onion #parsley #paprika #bayleaves #simmer #cod #bayleaf #onions </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
