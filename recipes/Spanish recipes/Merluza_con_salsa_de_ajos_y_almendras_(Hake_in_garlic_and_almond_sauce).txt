However, [[Mashed|mashed]] or [[Boiled potatoes|boiled potatoes]] would be fine, perhaps with some cooked [[Vegetables|vegetables]].\n===Variations===\nThe original recipe calls for [[Hake|hake]] steaks, in which case they will take a little longer to cook.  Steaks hold together better because of the [[bones]], but my lot don't like fiddling with [[bones]], so fillets were a better option.\n\nAlso use any [[Herbs|herbs]] you like, perhaps [[Tarragon|tarragon]] or [[Parsley|parsley]].\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes|Hake in garlic and almond sauce]]\n[[Category:Fish recipes|Hake in garlic and almond sauce]]\n[[Category:Garlic recipes|Hake in garlic and almond sauce]]\n[[Category:Main courses|Hake in garlic and almond sauce]]\n[[Category:Sea fish recipes|Hake in garlic and almond sauce]]\n[[Category:Spanish recipes|Hake in garlic and almond sauce]]\n[[Category:Boiled or simmered]]\n[[Category:Pan fried]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#hake #bones #garlic #tarragon #panfried #fish #vegetables #boiledpotatoes #oliveoil #onion #salad </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
