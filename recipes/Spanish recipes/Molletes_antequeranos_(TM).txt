They are eaten at breakfast and throughout the day as a [[Snack|snack]]. Similar versions of molletes are found throughout southern [[Spain]]. Whilst the serving suggestion I have given is typical, you can basically do what you want with them.  They are named after the lovely town of Antequera in Andaluc\u00eda\n\n\n'''For the [[Mother dough|mother dough]]'''\n{{RecipeIngredientsTM\n| 100g strong [[Bread|bread]] [[Flour|flour]]\n| 50g water\n| 1 x 7g sachet of [[Dried yeast|dried yeast]] or 15g fresh [[Yeast|yeast]]\n}}\n'''For the main [[Dough|dough]]'''\n{{RecipeIngredientsNB\n| 320g water\n| 1 x 7g sachet of [[Dried yeast|dried yeast]] or 15 g fresh [[Yeast|yeast]]\n| 500g strong [[Bread|bread]] [[Flour|flour]]\n| 40g [[Olive|olive]] or [[Sunflower oil|sunflower oil]].\n| 2 teaspoons [[Salt|salt]]\n}}\n===Method===\n\n\n'''For the [[Mother dough|mother dough]]'''\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Add the [[Flour|flour]], water and [[Yeast|yeast]] to the bowl '''20 secs / Speed 3'''.\n| Scrape down the bowl, remove the blades and form the mixture into a ball.\n| Replace the blades, add the [[Dough|dough]] '''2:30 minutes /  [[Knead]]''' - because it is such a small quantity, the TM will not knead it properly unless you manually form it into a ball.\n| Remove from the bowl, shape into a ball and cut a cross in the top of it.\n| Have ready a bowl of warm water, place the [[Dough|dough]] into it and cover with [[Cling film|cling film]] or a see-through shower cap.\n}}\n'''For the main [[Dough|dough]]'''\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Immediately proceed to make the main [[Dough|dough]] by adding the water and the [[Yeast|yeast]] to the bowl '''2:30 minutes / 37\u00b0 / Speed 1'''.\n| Add the remaining ingredients to the bowl '''20 seconds / Speed 3'''.\n| Add the [[Mother dough|mother dough]], which should now be floating in the water, then '''2:30 minutes / Knead''' (If it isn't floating, wait until it does - it should take no more than 10 minutes).\n| Leave in the bowl until the [[Dough|dough]] has pushed up the MC from the lid.\n| Tip onto a lightly floured surface, removing the blades from the TM.\n| Weigh the [[Dough|dough]] and divide into 6 pieces - each piece should weigh about 180g.\n| Shape each piece into a sort of [[Cow|cow]] pat and place on a greased [[Baking|baking]] sheet until they have doubled in size. This could take several hours or even overnight as there is no [[Sugar|sugar]] to encourage the [[Yeast|yeast]] to work.\n| Preheat the [[Oven|oven]] to 250 C/475 F/Gas 9.\n| If you wish, you can lightly dust the molletes with [[Flour|flour]].\n| Once heated, put them into the [[Oven|oven]], and place a bowl on the oven floor.\n| Fill the bowl with [[Boiling|boiling]] water and immediately reduce the temperature to 200 C/400 F/Gas 6.\n| [[Bake]] for around 20 minutes.\n| 5 minutes before the end of [[Baking|baking]], you can [[Spray|spray]] the molletes with water.\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nLightly toast them and paint with [[Garlic|garlic]]-infused [[Olive oil|olive oil]] or melted [[Lard|lard]]. Add [[Grated|grated]] [[Tomato|tomato]] (minus the skin) and chopped [[Serrano]] or Ib\u00e9rico [[Ham|ham]]. Use more [[Oil|oil]] if desired. \n===Recipe source===\n* Adapted for [[Thermomix]] from a recipe I found on a [[Spanish]] web site a few years ago and can no longer find.\n===Chef's notes===\nYou will probably need to use two [[Baking|baking]] trays with 3 molletes on each as they spread. Also use the shallowest trays you have otherwise the undersides of the molletes may be still slightly doughy. If you only have deepish trays, then after the normal cooking time, turn over the molletes and put them back into the [[Oven|oven]] for a few minutes. \n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Spanish recipes]]\n[[Category:Bread and baking]]\n[[Category:Breakfast recipes]]\n[[Category:Snacks and light bites]]\n[[Category:Vegan recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes]]\n[[Category:Thermomix recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#dough #yeast #flour #baking #motherdough #driedyeast #bread #thermomixrecipes #lard #knead #snack </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
