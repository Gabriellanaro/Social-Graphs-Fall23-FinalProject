We often go early in the morning just as the sun is coming up to see the [[Olives|olives]] on the trees.\n\nMaybe it sounds odd, but with local [[Sausages|sausages]], some strong black [[Coffee|coffee]] and our beautiful olive groves laid out before us this is a pretty sublime dish - and not one that should be restricted to breakfast. A good [[Olive oil|olive oil]] is key - try using our Early Harvest [[Olive]] [[Oil]] from Catalonia.\n\nLeopold Pomes, author of the Theory and Practice of [[Bread]] with [[Tomato]] (1984) claims this was invented by a painter who wanted to combine the colours of the sunset on an edible base. It\u0092s more likely this tasty delicacy was created by an inventive Catalan wanting to use up the previous day\u0092s bread.\"\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 8 slices of [[Toasted|toasted]] [[Ciabatta|ciabatta]] or [[Country bread|country bread]] \n| 2 Cloves [[Garlic|garlic]], peeled and cut in half \n| 2 large ripe [[Tomatoes|tomatoes]] cut in quarters \n| [[Belazu]] Early Harvest [[Extra virgin olive oil|extra virgin olive oil]] \n| [[Sea Salt|sea salt]]\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n|Take a piece of the [[Toasted|toasted]] [[Ciabatta|ciabatta]] and rub the cut edge of the [[Garlic|garlic]] over its surface. Then rub the cut side of a [[Tomato|tomato]] quarter over the toast until it softens with the tomato pulp. Drizzle [[Olive oil|olive oil]] on top and sprinkle with [[Sea Salt|sea salt]]. \n|Repeat with the remaining toast and serve.\n}}\n\n{{Template:Belazu attribution}}\n\n===Belazu products used in this recipe===\n* [http://www.mybelazu.com/details/early-harvest.html Belazu Early Harvest Extra Virgin Olive Oil Unfiltered]\n\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Belazu recipes]]\n[[Category:Recipes from other sites]]\n[[Category:Breakfast recipes]]\n[[Category:Snacks and light bites]]\n[[Category:Spanish recipes]]\n[[Category:Starters]]\n[[Category:Tapas, mezze and antipasti]]\n[[Category:Vegetable recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegan recipes]]\n[[Category:Grilled, griddled or barbecued]]\n[[Category:Toasted]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#toasted #garlic #ciabatta #tomato #oliveoil #olive #tomatoes #pancontomatev #belazu #olives #countrybread </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
