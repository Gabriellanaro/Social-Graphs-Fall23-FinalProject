My version below uses a different method and also requires you to start this the evening before the day you want to [[Bake|bake]] it.\n\nIt is an extremely wet [[Dough|dough]] (120% hydration) and I would advise you to mix it using a food [[Mixer|mixer]] with a beater or whisk (the mixture is too wet to benefit from using a dough hook).  If you have a Kenwood Chef / Major, the  flexi-beater is ideal.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 10g fresh [[Yeast|yeast]]\n| 600g [[Sparkling mineral water|sparkling mineral water]]\n| 500g very strong bread [[Flour|flour]], eg Waitrose Very Strong Canadian [[Bread]] [[Flour]]\n| 12g [[Salt|salt]]\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Dissolve the [[Yeast|yeast]] in the water.\n| Pour into a bowl and add 250g of the [[Flour|flour]].\n| Mix well, cover in [[Clingfilm|clingfilm]] and leave overnight at room temperature.\n| The following morning add the remaining [[Flour|flour]] and the [[Salt|salt]].\n| Mix for about 5 minutes on the second slowest speed.\n| Cover and leave to rest for 2 hours.\n| Grease a 900g loaf tin with [[Oil|oil]] - [[Groundnut oil|groundnut oil]] is best as it has a high smokepoint.\n| Pour the [[Dough|dough]] into it (it should come up to about three-quarters of the tin.\n| Allow to prove for 1 hour, covered.\n| Meanwhile, place a tray or pan of [[Boiling|boiling]] water in the bottom of the [[Oven|oven]].\n| Switch on the [[Oven|oven]] to its highest temperature.\n| When the [[Dough|dough]] has finished [[Proving|proving]], sprinkle with [[Flour|flour]], put it in the [[Oven|oven]] and reduce the temperature to 190\u00b0 C (375\u00b0 F - gas 5), [fan oven 170\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour].\n| [[Bake]] for 60 minutes.\n| Once [[Baked|baked]], turn out onto a [[Cooling rack|cooling rack]] and allow to cool.\n| If the [[bread]] is a little soft on the bottom, turn it over, place on a baking tray and return to the oven for 10 minutes or so until crisp.\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nGood toasted and rubbed with [[Garlic|garlic]], [[tomato]] and [[olive oil]].\n===Chef's notes===\nAs this is a wet dough, I would recommend that you line your bread tin with [[Bake-O-Glide]], or something similar.\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Spanish recipes]]\n[[Category:Bread and baking]]\n[[Category:Vegan recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes]][[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#flour #dough #bread #bake #yeast #baked #sparklingmineralwater #tomato #boiling #coolingrack #clingfilm </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
