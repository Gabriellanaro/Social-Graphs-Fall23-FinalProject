It should be bubbling when it is ready to use.\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| If making by [[Hand|hand]], dissolve the fresh [[Yeast|yeast]] in, place in a floured bowl,add the other ingredients and [[Kneading bread|knead]] thoroughly for 10 minutes.\n| Cover with a cloth and allow to rise until it has doubled in size - about 1-2 hours. \n| If using a [[Bread machine|bread machine]], place the ingredients in the pan in the order given in your manufacturer's manual.\n| Set to a basic [[Dough|dough]] programme - in the Panasonic SD-253/254/255, this will take about 2 hours and 20 minutes.  For the [[Panasonic SD-ZB2502 automatic breadmaker]], this is menu option 16.\n| [[Knock back]] the [[Dough|dough]] on a floured board and shape into two loaves.\n| Place on a [[baking tray]], which has been sprinkled with some [[Semolina|semolina]] and sprinkle some more semolina on top of the loaves.\n| Because the [[Dough|dough]] is soft, allow enough space for each loaf to spread.\n| Cover and leave to rise for a further two hours.\n| Preheat the [[Oven|oven]] to 250\u00b0 C (475\u00b0 F - gas 9) and place a try of water in the bottom of the oven.  Alternatively, you can spray the [[Bread|bread]] with water 2 or 3 times during its [[Baking|baking]] period.\n| When the [[Oven|oven]] is hot, reduce the temperature slightly and make some cuts in the [[Bread|bread]] (a [[Grignette|grignette]] is best for this). \n| [[Bake]] for 40 minutes or until the [[Bread|bread]] sounds hollow when tapped.\n}}\n===Variations===\nIt is suggested that you use 'half strength' [[Bread|bread]] [[Flour|flour]] and if using what we know in the UK as 'strong' bread flour. you may need to add more water.  From something I read, Tesco's own make bread flour is probably the least strong, however, I am going to experiment with a mixture of very strong Canadian flour and [[Italian]] type 00 [[Pizza dough|pizza dough]] flour.  I will update this once I have finished playing around.\n===Chef's notes===\nIf you are making the [[Dough|dough]] in a [[Bread maker|bread maker]], I would suggest using half quantities, as the ones given in the above recipe are probably too much for the average machine.\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes|Pan de pueblo]]\n[[Category:Bread and baking|Pan de pueblo]]\n[[Category:Breadmaker recipes|Pan de pueblo]]\n[[Category:Spanish recipes|Pan de pueblo]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes|Pan de pueblo]]\n[[Category:Vegan recipes]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#bread #dough #flour #semolina #bake #poolish #yeast #kneadingbread #wheat #baking #refrigerated </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
