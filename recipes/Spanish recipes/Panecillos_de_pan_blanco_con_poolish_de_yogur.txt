They are also easy to make as once the ingredients are mixed properly, no kneading is required.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 500g strong [[Bread|bread]] [[Flour|flour]]\n| 10g [[Salt|salt]]\n| 225ml tepid water\n| 5g fresh [[Yeast|yeast]]\n| 200g [[Yoghurt poolish|yogurt poolish]] straight from the [[Fridge|fridge]]\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Dissolve the [[Yeast|yeast]] in the tepid water.\n| Mix the [[Flour|flour]], [[Salt|salt]] and [[Yoghurt poolish|yogurt poolish]].\n| When the [[Yeast|yeast]] has dissolved, mix with the remaining ingredients.\n| Cover, and allow to rest for 15 minutes.\n| Divide the mixture into 50g pieces and shape into round, smooth balls.\n| Place them on greased [[baking tray]]s, leaving a reasonable gap between each one as they will spread.\n| Cover with a damp cloth and leave to prove for about 90 minutes in the warmest part of the kitchen.\n| Preheat the [[Oven|oven]], preferably to 250\u00b0 C (475\u00b0 F - gas 9), or the highest temperature if yours is lower.\n| At the same time, place a [[baking tray]] half full of water at the bottom of the [[Oven|oven]] - this is to generate [[Steam|steam]].\n| Before [[Baking|baking]] the  rolls, spray them lightly with a little water as this helps them to colour on the outside.\n| [[Bake]] for about 12 minutes until the rolls are golden [[Brown|brown]].\n| Cool on a wire rack\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nBecause the rolls are small, cut in half, they would make an excellent base for canap\u00e9s.  However, they were so delicious, they did not last long enough for that!\n===Variations===\nXavier Barriga suggests that you use only 30g of [[Dough|dough]] per roll which would make them very small indeed.  Also, he cuts the tops with a pair of scissors just before you put them in the [[Oven|oven]].  This looks very pretty but whenever I do that, my dough deflates!\n\nYou can sprinkle them with [[Poppy seeds|poppy seeds]] or [[Toasted sesame seeds|toasted sesame seeds]] if you wish.\n===Chef's notes===\nThese are best consumed on the day that they are [[Baked|baked]], so you may wish to reduce the quantity, or [[Freeze|freeze]] any that are not to be eaten immediately.  They will be fine to eat the next day, but they will have lost some of their delicious-ness.\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Accompaniments]]\n[[Category:Bread and baking]]\n[[Category:Spanish recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes]]\n[[Category:Favourite recipes]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#yoghurtpoolish #panecillosdepanblancoconpoolishdeyogur #yeast #bakingtray #flour #baked #dough #steam #bread #toastedsesameseeds #poppyseeds </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
