Also you can use a rack in the [[Roasting|roasting]] tin.  However, you will need to lengthen the cooking time.\n\n--[[User:JuliaBalbilla|JuliaBalbilla]] 15:47, 23 January 2009 (UTC)\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes|Chicken breasts]]\n[[Category:Main courses|Chicken breasts]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes|Chicken breasts]]\n[[Category:Poultry recipes|Chicken breasts]]\n[[Category:Spanish recipes|Chicken breasts]]\n[[Category:Pan fried]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#diced #vegetables #serranoham #oliveoil #roasting #chicken #ham #newpotatoes #springonions #meatmallet #greenpepper </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
