This is another good excuse to use your [[tomato press]].\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 1 whole [[Egg|egg]], plus one yolk\n| 1-2 bulbs [[Garlic|garlic]], peeled\n| 1 litre [[Olive oil|olive oil]]\n| 380 g [[Bread|bread]]\n| 1.2 kg ripe [[Tomatoes, peeled|tomatoes, peeled]]\n| [[Salt]], to taste\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| In a [[Food processor|food processor]], or using a stick [[Blender|blender]], beat the [[Egg|egg]] and the yolk.\n| Add the [[Garlic|garlic]] cloves and process until the mixture is smooth.\n| Add some [[Oil|oil]], a little at a time, then some [[Bread|bread]] and some of the [[Tomatoes|tomatoes]].\n| Keep repeating this process until all of the ingredients have been used.\n| Add [[Salt|salt]] as desired.\n| The salmorejo should have the consistency of soft [[Mayonnaise|mayonnaise]].\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nIt is commonly served as a [[Tapa|tapa]] and like porra, is tradtionally accompanied by chopped, [[Hard-boiled egg|hard-boiled egg]].   However, I like to use it as a [[Sauce|sauce]] or a [[Dip|dip]].  Also try it in sandwiches instead of [[Mayonnaise|mayonnaise]].\n===Variations===\nThere are many variations of salmorejo.  You may wish to add a few tablespoons of [[Wine|wine]] or [[Sherry vinegar|sherry vinegar]].  I used half olive oil and half [[rapeseed]] oil - not authentic, but nice.  The [[Garlic|garlic]] quantity can be varied to taste.  Initially I made it with 1 bulb, but you can hardly taste it, so be BRAVE!!\n===Chef's notes===\nThe quantity given is rather large and only just fits in the largest bowl of a Magimix.  I would suggest making half or even a quarter of the volume to start with, unless you have a glut of [[Tomatoes|tomatoes]] or are addicted to salmorejo.  I have and I am.\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes|Salmorejo]]\n[[Category:Dips and sauces|Salmorejo]]\n[[Category:Egg recipes|Salmorejo]]\n[[Category:Garlic recipes]]\n[[Category:Snacks and light bites|Salmorejo]]\n[[Category:Spanish recipes|Salmorejo]]\n[[Category:Tapas, mezze and antipasti]]\n[[Category:Vegetable recipes|Salmorejo]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes|Salmorejo]]\n[[Category:Uncooked]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#garlic #bread #egg #tomatoes #mayonnaise #wine #tapa #rapeseed #tomatopress #porraantequerana #foodprocessor </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
