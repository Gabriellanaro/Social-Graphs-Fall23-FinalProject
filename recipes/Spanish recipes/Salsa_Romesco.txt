It is a good idea to check the oven regularly to prevent over-cooking or burning.\n| Drain the ingredients into a [[Blender|blender]] or food-processor, having peeled the [[Tomatoes|tomatoes]] and [[Garlic|garlic]], reserving the [[Oil|oil]].\n| Add the [[Vinegar|vinegar]] and [[\u00f1oras]] to the [[Salsa|salsa]] and blend throughly.\n| Add the reserved [[Oil|oil]], little by little until you have the required thickness.  Season to taste. and if necessary, add more oil.\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe with [[Meat|meat]], [[Fish|fish]] or [[Vegetables|vegetables]] and can also be used as a dressing.\n\n===Variations===\nTraditionally, the [[Nuts|nuts]], [[Tomatoes|tomatoes]], [[Garlic|garlic]] and [[Bread|bread]] are [[Grilled|grilled]], but I find that [[Roasting|roasting]] gives a richer flavour.\n\nSome people like to include piquillo [[Peppers|peppers]] to the [[Salsa|salsa]] as they add sweetness.\n\n===Chef's notes===\nIf you cannot find [[\u00f1oras]], [[Ancho|ancho]] [[Peppers|peppers]] can be substituted.\n\n\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes|Salsa romesco]]\n[[Category:Dips and sauces|Salsa romesco]]\n[[Category:Garlic recipes]]\n[[Category:Spanish recipes|Salsa romesco]]\n[[Category:Vegetable recipes|Salsa romesco]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#salsaromesco #tomatoes #garlic #salsa #vinegar #peppers #roasting #grilled #ancho #fish #whitewinevinegar </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
