Season with [[Salt|salt]] and [[Freshly ground pepper|freshly ground pepper]], put in an oiled [[Roasting|roasting]] tin and [[Roast|roast]] in the middle of the [[Oven|oven]] for 20 minutes.\n| After this time, remove the [[Lamb|lamb]] from the [[Oven|oven]] and reduce the heat to 170\u00b0C, 325\u00b0F, Gas mark 3. Add 310ml of the [[Sherry|sherry]] to the lamb, cover tightly with [[Foil|foil]], and cook on the bottom shelf of the oven for 4 hours, [[Basting|basting]] every 30 minutes with the sherry. Add the 6 [[Garlic|garlic]] bulbs after 2 hours. Check that the sherry is not drying up, and add more if necessary.\n| While you are cooking the [[Lamb|lamb]], make the [[Potatoes|potatoes]] and the allioli. Cut the potatoes into very thin rounds, put in a large pan of [[Salted|salted]] water and bring to the [[Boil|boil]]. Drain, place in a shallow oiled [[Oven|oven]] proof dish, season with [[Salt|salt]] and [[Freshly ground pepper|freshly ground pepper]], then add the half tub of [[Lamb stock|lamb stock]] and sprinkle over the [[Thyme leaves|thyme leaves]].\n| Place in the oven on the shelf above the lamb for the last 1 hour 30 minues of the cooking time, after which time the potatoes will be golden and will have absorbed all the lamb [[Stock|stock]].\n| While the [[Potatoes|potatoes]] are cooking, make the allioli. Pur\u00e9e the Crushed [[Garlic|garlic]] with the [[Egg|egg]] in a [[Food processor|food processor]], then mix the [[Olive oil|olive oil]] and tablespoon of [[Lemon juice|lemon juice]] together in a jug and slowly pour into the egg mixture with the motor running. Add half a teaspoon of [[Salt|salt]] and some [[Freshly ground black pepper|freshly ground black pepper]] and leave the motor on for a further 10 seconds, then transfer to a bowl, ready to serve.

To make the [[Gravy|gravy]], mash the cooked garlic with a potato masher, add the remaining half tub of [[Lamb stock|lamb stock]] to the [[Roasting|roasting]] tin, bring to the [[Boil|boil]], season, strain through a coarse [[sieve]] or [[China cap]] and pour into a bowl, ready to serve.

I have increased the potato cooking time by 30 minutes and you may still need to finish them off under the grill if you want them crisped up a little.\nDon't be put off a recipe that calls for a leg of lamb because of the high cost.
