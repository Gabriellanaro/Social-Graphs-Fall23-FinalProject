In [[Spain]], they seem to be eaten much more than they are in the UK.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 4 tablespoons [[Oil|oil]]\n| 8 oven-ready [[quails]]\n| 8 rashers of streaky [[Bacon|bacon]]\n| 3 medium [[Onions|onions]], peeled and [[Diced|diced]]\n| [[Garlic]], to taste, chopped\n| 2 teaspoons [[Dried oregano|dried oregano]]\n| 150 ml [[Dry cider|dry cider]] or [[White wine|white wine]]\n| 1 litre hot [[Vegetable|vegetable]] or [[Chicken stock|chicken stock]], or enough to cover\n| Seasoning\n| Parsley to garnich, coarsely chopped\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Heat the [[Oil|oil]] in a saucepan.\n| Wrap a rasher of [[Bacon|bacon]] around each [[quail]] and add to the pan with the [[Onion|onion]].\n| Cook until all sides of the [[quails]] are beginning to [[Brown|brown]], the stir in the [[Garlic|garlic]] and [[Oregano|oregano]].\n| Cook for a few minutes until the [[Garlic|garlic]] is golden.\n| Add the [[Cider|cider]] or [[Wine|wine]], the [[Stock|stock]] and seasoning.\n| Cover, and [[Simmer|simmer]] for about 45 minutes until the quails are cooked.\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nGarnish with the [[parsley]] and serve with [[Fried potatoes|fried potatoes]] and/or [[Salad|salad]].\n===Chef's notes===\nWe added 1 bulb of [[Garlic|garlic]] for 2 quails, but vary the quantity as desired.  We used back [[bacon]] which is too short really and fell off the [[quails]] as they were browning.\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes|Quails stewed]]\n[[Category:Game recipes|Quails stewed]]\n[[Category:Garlic recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses|Quails stewed]]\n[[Category:Snacks and light bites|Quails stewed]]\n[[Category:Spanish recipes|Quails stewed]]\n[[Category:Stews and casseroles|Quails stewed]]\n[[Category:Starters|Quails stewed]]\n[[Category:Cooking with wine|Quails stewed]]\n[[Category:Stewed, braised or pot roasted]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#garlic #stewedquails #bacon #quails #quail #cider #oregano #friedpotatoes #onion #wine #drycider </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
