Varoma / Speed 1'''.\n| Add the [[Garlic|garlic]], [[Onion|onion]] and [[Carrots|carrots]] '''10 seconds / Speed 5''' [push down ingredients in the bowl] then '''7 minutes / Temp. Varoma / Speed 3&frac12;'''.\n| Push down the ingredients in the bowl and put the internal [[Steaming|steaming]] basket on the lid to avoid splashes.\n| Add the [[Tomatoes|tomatoes]] and the remaining ingredients '''30 minutes / Temp. Varoma / Speed 1'''.\n| If you want it thicker, you can cook it for '''5-10 minutes''' longer, so that the liquid evaporates.  If using [[Basil|basil]], do not add it until the last few minutes.\n}}\n===Recipe source===\n* This is a translation of a recipe in '''''[[Thermomix]] TM31 - Imprescindible para tu cocina''''' which is the book supplied with [[Spanish]] TMXs.\n===Variations===\nYou can use fresh [[Tomatoes|tomatoes]], but they must be very red and ripe.  Make a cut into them and drain off all the liquid, by pressing them with your hands.  You will have to blitz them very well at '''Speed 6-7''', until you have a pur\u00e9e.  Take them out and reserve to add to the [[Sofrito|sofrito]] once it is made, because if they are blended together, they will lose their lovely red colour.\n\nIf, once the whole [[Sauce|sauce]] has finished cooking, you want to blitz the [[Tomatoes|tomatoes]] more, do not do this whilst the sauce is hot.  Wait until it has cooled a little and blitz at '''Speed 7''', but remember that by doing this you will get more of an [[Orange|orange]] colour.\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Spanish recipes]]\n[[Category:Dips and sauces]]\n[[Category:Vegan recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegetable recipes]]\n[[Category:Thermomix recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#tomatoes #carrots #garlic #thermomix #spanish #onion #sofrito #basilleaves #steaming #thermomixrecipes #tomatosauce </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
