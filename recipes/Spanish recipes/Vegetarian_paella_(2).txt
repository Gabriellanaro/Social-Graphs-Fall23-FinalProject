In [[Spain]] many family members and friends come together to eat [[Paella]] at home, on the beach, in restaurants and at Fiesta time as anytime is a good time to eat Paella. Here are some Paella recipes to [[Help|help]] you on your Paella journey.

Keep stirring throughout so the [[Bomba]] [[Rice]] does not stick to the bottom of the pan (Although in [[Spain]] Traditional [[Paella]] is cooked to stick to the bottom of the pan so the choice is yours).\n| Add the [[Black olives|black olives]], remove the [[Bay leaves|bay leaves]] and stir in the fresh chopped [[Parsley|parsley]]. Season to taste with [[Salt|salt]] and [[Black pepper|black pepper]].\n| Take off the heat and cover for 5 minutes to let all the ingredients truly infuse together.\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe with [[Lemon wedges|lemon wedges]] and tuck in for a fantastic treat for you and your guests!!\n===Recipe source===\n* ''Dominic Green'' from [http://www.paellaworld.co.uk Paella World]: [[Paella World]] has kindly given Cookipedia permission to use this recipe.
