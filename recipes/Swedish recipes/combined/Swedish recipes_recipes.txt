Gravlax is usually served as an [[appetiser]], sliced thinly and accompanied by hovm\u00e4stars\u00e5s (also known as gravlaxs\u00e5s), a dill and mustard sauce, either on bread of some kind, or with [[boiled potatoes]].\n\nWhen I first made this and tasted it, I didn't like the taste and thought it rather odd.  Over the next few days I had the odd nibble and started to change my mind, by the end of 1 week I was waking up in the middle of the night, sneaking down to the fridge for another slice.  Do try this, it's brilliant!\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 450 g [[Salmon fillets|salmon fillets]] (see Chef's notes)\n| 2 tablespoons [[Sea Salt|sea salt]]\n| 2 tablespoons [[Caster sugar|caster sugar]]\n| 2 teaspoons [[Black peppercorns|black peppercorns]], freshly [[Ground|ground]]\n| 2 teaspoons [[Juniper berries|juniper berries]], crushed in a [[Pestle and mortar|pestle and mortar]] \n| A really big handful of fresh [[Dill|dill]]\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Discovering by touch, remove all [[bones]] from the fillet - folding it over and using a clean pair of pliers or [[tweezers]] to pull out  the really obstinate ones.  The [[bones]] are in a symmetrical pattern, so once you have found one, check the other side for its matching pair. \n| Mix the [[Salt|salt]], [[Sugar|sugar]], [[Peppercorns|peppercorns]] and [[Juniper|juniper]] in a bowl\n| Treating each fillet individually, cut a sheet of plastic-wrap about 3 times the size of the fillet and lay the fillet skin-side down in the centre of the plastic-wrap.\n| Sprinkle the mixture over the fillet ensuring that you caver every part of the flesh.\n| Now lay the sprigs of [[Dill|dill]] on the top of the fillet.  Using whole sprigs, folded over, makes it easier to remove when we discard it at the finish.\n| Wrap the [[Salmon|salmon]] tightly in the plastic-wrap and finish by wrapping in another layer of plastic.\n| Place the fillet in a container to catch any escaping juices and [[Refrigerate|refrigerate]] for three days.  Turn daily and drain any liquid that has escaped.\n| After 3 days, unwrap, discard the [[Dill|dill]] and quickly rinse under cold water to remove all trace of the mixture.\n| Pat dry with paper towels\n}}\n===Servings===\nServes 6 - Enough for 450g (1 lb) of [[Salmon fillets|salmon fillets]]\n===Serving suggestions===\nSlice very thinly at a 30\u00b0 angle to the fillet\nServe on toast, [[Crackers|crackers]], [[Crispbread|crispbread]] etc.  A squeeze of [[Lemon juice|lemon juice]] is the only extra that you are likely to need.\n===Chef's notes===\nUse [[Salmon fillets|salmon fillets]] (eg: thin) with the flesh cut parallel to the backbone, not [[Salmon steaks|salmon steaks]] (eg: thick) with the flesh cut down into the backbone.\n\nIgnoring the above, I used 1 (375 g) salmon steak, sliced in half lengthwise, see picture. A mean, 'supermarket-sized' bunch of dill is just enough for this steak and the two combined will be a great way to try this recipe out.  Bart spices now do juniper berries in small spice bottles, so hunt them out in the spices section.\n\nThere seems to be varying opinions as top whether the steaks should be weighed down.  I have to say that from my experience of [[curing bacon]], weights enable more liquid to be drawn off without using excess [[salt]], so I'm in that camp!  I've used non-metallic objects to exert an even pressure when the lid is closed, Weighed down between two plates would work fine, but you will have a fishy fridge that way.\n\nHaving made it, I would now be inclined to carefully slice the skin off before processing so the flavour can properly penetrate both side of the fillet.\n===Step by step images===\n<gallery widths=200px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Gravlax, removing pin [[bones]] with pliers.jpg|Removing the pin-[[bones]] with pliers\nImage:Gravlax, steak cut in half.jpg|The steak, sliced in half, lengthwise\nImage:Gravlax, cover with the cure.jpg|Cover both sides of the fillet with the cure\nImage:Gravlax, lay the dill weed on top.jpg|Lay the dill evenly on top\nImage:Gravlax, wrapped and placed in a lock and lock box.jpg|Wrapped in cling-film and placed in a lock and lock box\nImage:Gravlax, use a non-metallic object to exert pressure.jpg|Using non-metallic objects to exert pressure when the lid is closed\nImage:Gravlax, Dated and ready for 3 days refrigeration.jpg|Dated and ready for 3 days refrigeration\nImage:Gravlax, sliced.jpg|My first attempt, after 4 days processing - success!\n</gallery>\nI combined my first gravlax with [[spaghetti]], [[cream cheese]] and [[sour cream]] to make [[Gravlax spaghetti cream|this amazing recipe]].\n===Variations===\nTry your gravlax in a [[Smoked salmon pancake stack]]!\n===See also===\n* [[Gravlax spaghetti cream|Gravlax spaghetti cream recipe]]\n* [[Smoked salmon and crayfish parcels|Gravlax and crayfish parcels]]\n\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Danish recipes]]\n[[Category:Norwegian recipes]]\n[[Category:Fish recipes]]\n[[Category:Freshwater fish recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Marinades dressings and butters]]\n[[Category:Salad recipes]]\n[[Category:Sea fish recipes]]\n[[Category:Finnish recipes]]\n[[Category:Snacks and light bites]]\n[[Category:Starters]]\n[[Category:Swedish recipes]]\n[[Category:Ingredients]]\n[[Category:Fish and seafood]]\n[[Category:Prepared foods]]\n[[Category:Uncooked]][[Category:Pickled]]\n{{CategoryLineIngredients}}\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#gravlax #dill #bones #salmonfillets #salmon #castersugar #juniper #spaghetti #refrigerate #pickled #crispbread </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"

This recipe makes 8 pancakes.\n\n===Swedish pancakes===\n\nThe recipe for traditional Swedish pancakes is the same as below, except that they might be served with a local preserve such as [[lingonberry]] jam.  They are traditionally follow [[\u00c4rtsoppa (Swedish pea soup)]] on a Thursday if what I read is to be believed.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 200 ml (7fl oz) [[milk]] mixed with 75 ml (3fl oz) cold water\n| 2 [[free range eggs]]\n| 110 g (4 oz) [[plain flour]], sifted\n| 50 g (2 oz) [[butter]]\n| pinch of table [[salt]]\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Sift the [[salt]] and [[flour]] into a large mixing bowl. Hold the sieve high so the [[flour]] gets combined with lots of air\n| Make a well in the centre of the [[flour]] and break the [[eggs]] into it.\n| With a spatula mix the [[eggs]] and [[flour]] together\n| Ideally with an electric hand mixer, gradually add the milk and water mix whilst whisking. Your goal is a smooth [[batter]] with no lumps or stray bits of [[flour]]\n| There is no need to leave the mixture to stand, make the pancakes straight away\n| Heat the [[butter]] in a heavy [[frying]] pan, swill it around so the pan is well oiled but not [[dripping]] in [[fat]].  Pour the remaining [[butter]] into a plate to use for the remaining pancakes\n| Use 2 tablespoons of [[batter]] mixture per pancake, dolloped in the middle of the pan and instantly swirl the pan around to distribute the [[batter]] around the whole of the pan\n| Cook for about 30 seconds on the first side and about 15 seconds on the other side\n| Dab a little more [[butter]] on the [[frying]] pan before every fresh pancake\n| Stack them up on a plate, separated with sheets of grease proof paper and keep them warm in a very low oven\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\n* Serve with a squeeze of [[lemon juice]] and sprinkled with [[caster sugar]]\n* Try a little pineapple or strawberry jam or a little bit of [[honey]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Breton buckwheat pancake recipe]]\n* [[Cr\u00eape recipe]]\n* [[Potato pancakes]]\n* [[Crispy duck pancake recipe]]\n* [[Crispy potato pancakes]]\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Egg recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Starters]]\n[[Category:Sweets and desserts]]\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:Pan fried]]\n[[Category:Swedish recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#pancakes #flour #butter #batter #frying #eggs #castersugar #freerangeeggs #dripping #fat #lemonjuice </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
