Using the (clean!!) base of a small, heavy, iron frying pan is also a good way of doing this - see photo on the right\n| Melt 25 g of the [[Butter|butter]] in a [[Frying pan|frying pan]] and saut\u00e9 the [[Onions|onions]] and [[Garlic|garlic]] until soft.\n| Add the [[Ham|ham]] and [[Mushrooms|mushrooms]] and cook for 3 minutes, stirring continuously.\n| Add 1 tablespoon of the [[Flour|flour]] and cook for a further minute.\n| Slowly add the [[Wine|wine]], stirring using a figure of eight motion with a wooden spoon or spatula, so that it is absorbed by the [[Flour|flour]].\n| Add the [[Herbs|herbs]] and seasonings, and cook, still stirring, until the mixture is thick.\n| Remove from the heat and allow to cool.\n| Add the [[Egg yolk|egg yolk]] and the [[Cheese|cheese]] and mix thoroughly.\n| Spread 8 of the [[Pork|pork]] slices with the mixture, top with the remaining 8 slices to form a [[Sandwich|sandwich]] and pinch the edges to seal.\n| Heat the remaining [[Butter|butter]] in another [[Frying pan|frying pan]].\n| Dredge each [[Pork|pork]] '[[Sandwich|sandwich]]' in the remaining [[Flour|flour]], [[Dip|dip]] into the beaten [[Egg|egg]] and then the [[Breadcrumbs|breadcrumbs]].\n| Cook the [[Pork|pork]] over a fairly high heat for 3 or 4 minutes on each side and serve immediately.\n}}\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Appenzelleri fillet prep.jpg|thumb|300px|right|A small, heavy iron frying pan is excellent to flatten the fillets\nImage:Appenzelleri recipe.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Appenzelleri filling, using home cured ham\n</gallery>\n\n===Variations===\nTry to use [[Appenzeller cheese]] if you can.  It is available from [[Backhaus]] by mail order, but if you cannot get it, use [[Gruy\u00e8re cheese]] instead.\n===Serving suggestion===\nI had a little of the filling left over and as I had planned to have this with pasta, I am going to mix the leftover filling with some olive oil and mix into the pasta.\n===Chef's notes===\nYou could probably fill 2 pork fillets with the quantity of filling shown here and these freeze really well, (separate with pieces of [[grease-proof paper]]). Make a big batch in one go and stock the freezer up.\n{{Template:ThinkPig}}\n==See also==\n* [[Appenzeller cheese]] - The [[:Category:Swiss cheeses|Swiss cheese]]\n* [[Appenzell ap\u00e9ritif]] - A recipe for cheese on toast\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes|Pork appen]]\n[[Category:Cheese recipes|Pork appen]]\n[[Category:Egg recipes|Pork appen]]\n[[Category:Main courses|Pork appen]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes|Pork appen]]\n[[Category:Pork recipes|Pork appen]]\n[[Category:Swiss recipes|Pork appen]]\n[[Category:Cooking with wine|Pork app]]\n[[Category:Pan fried]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#pork #flour #appenzellercheese #diced #butter #breadcrumbs #sandwich #garlic #cheese #mushrooms #ham </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
