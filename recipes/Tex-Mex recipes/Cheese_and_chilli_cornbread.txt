It is based on Jamie Oliver's recipe of the same name, though I recall having to adjust the quantities quite a bit from his original recipe.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 60 g [[Butter|butter]]\n| 2 large [[Onions|onions]], peeled and thinly sliced\n| 1 350g can of [[Sweetcorn|sweetcorn]] kernels, drained\n| 4 large [[Eggs|eggs]], beaten\n| 325 g coarse [[Yellow cornmeal|yellow cornmeal]]\n| 250 ml full [[Fat|fat]] [[Milk|milk]]\n| 1 heaped teaspoon [[Baking powder|baking powder]]\n| 6 tablespoons [[Plain flour|plain flour]]\n| [[Sea Salt|Sea salt]] & [[Freshly ground black pepper|freshly ground black pepper]]\n| 150 g strong [[Cheddar cheese|cheddar cheese]], [[Grated|grated]]\n| 3 fresh [[Green chillies|green chillies]], 2 deseeded and chopped finely, the other cut into thin rings\n| [[Olive oil]] for greasing\n\n}}\n\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n* Preheat the [[Oven|oven]] to 200\u00b0 C (400\u00b0 F - gas 6)\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Add the [[Butter|butter]] to a [[Frying pan|frying pan]] or [[Wok|wok]], give it a good grind of [[Black pepper|black pepper]] and gently [[Fry|fry]] the [[Onions|onions]] for 15 minutes\n| Once the [[Onions|onions]] are golden, carefully add the drained [[Sweetcorn|sweetcorn]]\n| [[Stir-fry]] the [[Sweetcorn|sweetcorn]] for a few minutes then remove the pan from the heat and set to one side.\n| Add the [[Eggs|eggs]], [[milk]], [[Cornmeal|cornmeal]], [[Flour|flour]], [[Baking powder|baking powder]], a pinch of [[Salt|salt]] and most of the [[Cheese|cheese]] (leaving a little to sprinkle on the top) and beat until really well mixed.\n| Stir in the onions and sweetcorn and mix again.  It helps to leave the mixure to rest for 10 minutes after the first mix to allow the cornmeal to soak up the milk.\n| Grease two 22cm round flan sandwich tins with a little [[Olive oil|olive oil]], line the base with [[Greaseproof paper|greaseproof paper]] and pour in the [[Cornbread|cornbread]] mixture.\n| [[Bake]] for 20 minutes then carefully remove from the oven and sprinkle the top with the remaining sliced [[Chilies|chilies]] and [[Cheese|cheese]].\n| [[Bake]] for a further 10 minutes.\n| Remove from the [[baking tray]] and allow to cool on a wire rack for 15 minutes before serving.\n}}\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Cheese and chilli cornbread ready to bake.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Cheese and chilli cornbread, ready to bake\nImage:Cheese and chilli cornbread ingredients.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The ingredients for cheese and chilli cornbread\n</gallery>\n\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe hot or cold\n===Chef's note===\nDon't forget the [[greaseproof paper]] or you will find it very hard to get the cornbread out of the tins. :-(\n==See also==\nThis recipe is based on a version of Jamie Olivers 'Chilli cheese cornbread' from ''Jamie's America'' ISBN 978-0718154769\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Accompaniments]]\n[[Category:Barbecue recipes]]\n[[Category:Bread and baking]]\n[[Category:Cheese recipes]]\n[[Category:Chilli pepper recipes]]\n[[Category:Latin American recipes]]\n[[Category:Mexican recipes]]\n[[Category:North American recipes]]\n[[Category:Snacks and light bites]]\n[[Category:Spicy recipes]]\n[[Category:Starters]]\n[[Category:Tex-Mex recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#cheeseandchillicornbread #sweetcorn #onions #cheese #bakingpowder #bake #greaseproofpaper #eggs #cornbread #butter #oliveoil </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
