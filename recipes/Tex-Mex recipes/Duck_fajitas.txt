Serve this with '''[[cherry salsa]]''', chopped [[avocados]], [[spring onions]] and [[cucumbers]] and you will have an exceptional evening meal.  As it's a Mexican variation of [[crispy duck pancakes]] there is nothing to stop you using [[Chinese pancakes]] for this dish (except you can get more in a [[tortilla]]!)\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 2 [[duck]] breasts with skin\n| 150 g (5 oz)  [[Monterey Jack cheese]], [[grated]]\n| 1 [[red onion]], sliced\n| 2 [[sweet peppers]] of any colour, de-seeded and sliced\n| 2 small hot [[red chillies]], deseeded and sliced into rings\n| Pinch of [[cayenne pepper]]\n| &#188; teaspoon of [[dried]] [[oregano]]\n| &#189; teaspoon ground [[white cumin]] seeds\n| &#189; teaspoon [[Garlic|garlic]] powder or [[dried minced garlic]] (ground)\n| Splash of [[dry sherry]]\n| 1 Packet of [[corn tortillas]]\n| 2 large [[spring onions]], [[sliced on the diagonal]]\n}}\n\n1/2 [[cucumber]], peeled and [[julienned]] or quartered lengthwise and sliced in a [[food processor]]\n\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| With a very sharp knife, cut a few slashes in the skin of the [[duck]]\n| Place the [[duck]], skin-side down in a cold [[frying]] pan and cook for 10 minutes on a medium heat, regularly draining any excess [[fat]].\n| Flip the breasts over and cook for another 10 minutes or so, until nicely [[seared]]. Duck is ok to eat rare.\n| Remove and rest for 5 minutes\n| Cut the [[duck]] width-wise into slices\n| Heat the pan, with a little [[oil]] until, add the [[peppers]] and [[onions]] and and [[fry]] on a high heat for about 4 minutes. Add all but the [[sherry]] and spring onions and [[stir-fry]] for a few minutes\n| Add a good splash of [[sherry]] and stir to de-glaze the pan.\n| Place the duck mixture in a serving bowl\n| Assemble the pancakes [[How to make crispy aromatic duck at home|like this]]\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\n\nBring the [[tortillas]], duck mixture, [[lime wedges]], grated cheese, chopped [[avocados]], [[spring onions]] and [[cucumber]] slices to the table and let everyone make their own tortillas.\n\n===Chef's tip===\n\nIf using legs (I could not get breasts on the day I made this) you will probably be better cooking in an oven - they take so much longer because you don't get good contact with the pan as you do with breasts. 180\u00b0 C (350\u00b0 F - gas 4) for 45 minutes.\n\nDuck is OK to eat rare.  I remember being muttered at by the ''charming'' waiter at in a French restaurant when asking for duck (breasts) ''bien cuit''!\n\n{{Tortillas-See also}}\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes|Duck]]\n[[Category:Main courses|Duck]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes|Duck]]\n[[Category:Poultry recipes|Duck]]\n[[Category:Spicy recipes|Duck]]\n[[Category:Tex-Mex recipes|Duck]]\n[[Category:Favourite recipes]]\n[[Category:Stir fried]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#duckfajitas #duck #springonions #sherry #avocados #cucumber #onions #montereyjackcheese #whitecumin #grated #limewedges </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
