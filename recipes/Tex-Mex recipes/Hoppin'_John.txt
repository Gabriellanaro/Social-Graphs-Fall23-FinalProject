It consists of field [[Peas|peas]] or crowder peas ([[Black-eyed peas|black-eyed peas]]) and rice, with chopped [[Onion|onion]] and sliced [[Bacon|bacon]] or [[Sausages|sausages]], [[ham hock]] or fatback bacon.\n\nThroughout the coastal South, eating Hoppin' John on New Year's Day is thought to bring a year filled with luck, and it's eaten by everyone. The peas, or beans with little black \"eyes,\" signify coins. Fill your plate with them and your cup will run over, as in the 23rd Psalm, perhaps. [[Collard greens]] along with this dish are supposed to also add to the wealth since they are the colour of money. On the day after New Year's Day, leftover \"Hoppin' John\" is called '''\"Skippin' Jenny\"''', and further demonstrates one's frugality, bringing an even better chance of prosperity in the New Year, it is hoped.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 2 cups [[Dried|dried]] [[Black-eyed peas|black-eyed peas]] (about 340 g)\n| 2 cans of [[Black-eyed peas|black-eyed peas]], drained\n| 450 g (1 lb) lean slab [[Bacon|bacon]] \n| 1 large [[Onion|onion]], peeled and chopped\n| 1 small [[red bell pepper]], de-seeded and sliced\n| &#189; teaspoon crushed [[Chili flakes|chili flakes]]\n| &#189; teaspoon freshly ground [[cumin]] seeds\n| &#189; teaspoon dried [[oregano]]\n| &#189; teaspoon [[sea salt]] or [[celery salt]]\n| 1 [[bay leaf]]\n| 4 cups water or [[Chicken stock|chicken stock]]\n| 2 cups uncooked long-[[Grain|grain]] white [[Rice|rice]]. [[Basmati rice]] is fine for this, though probably not authentic!\n| [[Salt]] and [[Freshly ground black pepper|freshly ground black pepper]] to taste\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| If using canned black eyed [[Peas|peas]], start at step 5\n| Sort the [[Peas|peas]] and remove grit etc.\n| Soak in cold water, rinse and drain, repeat a few times\n| In a large pot, cover with cold water, bring to the [[Boil|boil]] and [[Simmer|simmer]] for 10 minutes, remove from heat and allow to stand for 2 hours.  Drain and rinse again.\n| To a large pot, add the soaked [[Black-eyed peas|black-eyed peas]], the [[ham hock]], the chopped [[Onion|onion]] and all of the herbs and spices.  If using spicy sausages I would wait for 1 hour before adding them\n| Add water or [[Chicken stock|chicken stock]] and bring to the [[Boil|boil]]\n| Reduce the heat and [[Simmer|simmer]] for 2 hours or until the [[Peas|peas]] are tender. (do not [[Boil|boil]] as the [[Beans|beans]] will burst)\n| Remove [[Bacon|bacon]], [[ham hock]] or [[Sausages|sausages]] and cut into bite-sized pieces\n| As with all [[rice]], rinse for a minute, in a sieve under cold running water to remove any excess starch\n| Return [[Meat|meat]] to pot. Stir in [[Rice|rice]], cover, and cook for 20 to 25 minutes or until rice is tender and liquid is absorbed\n| Season to taste with [[Salt|salt]] and [[Pepper|pepper]]\n}}\n===Variations===\nTry 450 g (1 lb) meaty [[Ham hocks|ham hocks]] or 450 g (1 lb) thick spicy [[Sausage|sausage]] instead of the bacon.\n===Serving suggestion===\nServe with [[collard greens]], [[cornbread]] or fresh crusty bread.\n===Chef's note===\nIf you like a bit more gravy then reduce the amount of rice.  You could of course increase the amount of stock but you would need to adjust the seasoning as well.\n{{Template:ThinkPig}}\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Chilli pepper recipes]]\n[[Category:Grain and bean recipes]]\n[[Category:Historic recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:Tex-Mex recipes]]\n[[Category:North American recipes]]\n[[Category:Pork recipes]]\n[[Category:Rice recipes]]\n[[Category:Spicy recipes]]\n[[Category:Stews and casseroles]]\n[[Category:Boiled or simmered]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#hoppinjohn #peas #rice #bacon #hamhock #onion #boil #sausages #collardgreens #beans #simmer </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
