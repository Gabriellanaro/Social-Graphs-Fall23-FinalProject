I spotted the [[Gressingham Memphis Barbecue Pulled Duck]] in Morrisons and thought it would make a good [[Taco|taco]] filling. \n\nThe [[Duck|duck]] was very good and I'll be getting more today.  Do note though that the duck is notreally pulled duck, it's duck legs with a sauce that need to be ''pulled'' once they've been cooked.  \n\nThe Old El Paso [[Tacos|tacos]] however, ''really'' let this recipe down.  They are so thin now that they break apart as you touch them. Any because they are so miserably thin, they don't even have the crunch purported on the packet.  Another cynical attempt at increasing profits I guess.\n\nIf you don't want to use the flimsy El Paso [[Tacos]], try to hunt down the cheaper and far nice Discovery [[Taco trays|taco trays]], or forget tacos altogether and use [[Corn|corn]] or [[Flour tortillas|flour tortillas]] instead.\n\nThe [[Duck|duck]] feels like it might serve 4 but is actually contains 2 duck legs, a [[Foil|foil]] tray and a sachet of [[Sauce|sauce]], plenty for 2 people, not enough for four.\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| 1 pack [[Gressingham Memphis BBQ Pulled Duck]] (2 duck legs in with [[Barbecue sauce|barbecue sauce]])\n| 1 Pack Discovery [[Taco trays|taco trays]] or if you must ,1 Pack El Paso [[Taco shells]] (see notes above)\n| 6 [[Spring onions|spring onions]]\n| 12 [[Baby tomatoes|baby tomatoes]]\n| Half a green [[Sweet Pepper|sweet pepper]]\n| 10 [[Black cherries|black cherries]]\n| 150 ml pot of [[Sour cream|sour cream]]\n}}\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n\n* Preheat your [[Oven|oven]] to 180\u00b0 C (350\u00b0 F - gas 4), [fan oven 160\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Memphis BBQ pulled duck tacos ingredients.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The basic ingredients\nImage:Gressingham Memphis Barbecue Pulled Duck.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Gressingham Memphis Barbecue Pulled Duck]] (whole duck legs with sauce)\n</gallery>\n\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| Remove the [[Duck|duck]] legs from the plastic wrapping and place in the tray provided, make sure you include all the lovely [[Fat|fat]] too!\n| Leave the [[Sauce|sauce]] sachet to one side for now\n| [[Roast]] the [[Duck|duck]] legs at 180\u00b0 C for 25 minutes, uncovered, in the tray provided\n| After 25 minutes, drain and discard some of the cooking juices (see [[Chef's notes]] below).\n| Add the contents of the Memphis [[Barbecue sauce|barbecue sauce]] to the duck's legs and mix well\n| [[Bake]] for a further 10 minutes\n| When there is 5 minutes remaining pop the [[Taco trays|taco trays]] or fragile El Paso [[Taco shells|taco shells]] into the [[Oven|oven]] to warm up\n| Meanwhile: chop the [[Spring onions|spring onions]] ([[Scallions|scallions]])\n| Halve the [[Tomatoes|tomatoes]]\n| Halve the [[Cherries|cherries]] and remove the stones\n| Chop the [[Green pepper|green pepper]]\n| Using two forks, shred the [[Duck|duck]] legs with two forks\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe the pulled [[Duck|duck]], [[Vegetables|vegetables]] and [[Tacos|tacos]] and [[Sour cream|sour cream]] in separate dishes so diners can assemble the tacos at the table\n===Variations===\nUse whatever filling ingredients that take your fancy, some other suggestions, sliced red onions, avocado, pickled chillies, crispy lettuce, pineapple chunks.\n===Chef's notes===\nThe [[Gressingham BBQ Pulled Duck]] (legs) are already pre-cooked. If you are using [[Fresh duck|fresh duck]] legs, they will will probably take about the same time, but the [[Oven|oven]] could do with being 1 little warmed (190\u00b0 C - 200\u00b0 C) and they will benefit from resting for 15 minutes once removed from the oven.\n\nThe cooking instructions on the [[Gressingham Pulled Duck]] suggests discarding all of the cooking juices after 25 minutes of [[Roasting|roasting]]. I would definitely suggest otherwise.  Next time I will mix them in with the [[Barbecue sauce|barbecue sauce]], and not waste them.\n\nI allowed the juices to solidify overnight and it was almost all lovely tasty jelly, hardly any [[Fat|fat]] - made a great [[Sandwich|sandwich]] filling and reminded me of jelly and [[Dripping|dripping]] of old.\n{{Tortillas-See also}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:North American recipes]]\n[[Category:Tex-Mex recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Spicy recipes]]\n[[Category:Fruit recipes]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n[[Category:Barbecue recipes]]\n[[Category:Poultry recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#duck #memphisbbqpulledducktacos #barbecuesauce #tacotrays #tacos #tacoshells #springonions #sourcream #sauce #fat #cherries </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
