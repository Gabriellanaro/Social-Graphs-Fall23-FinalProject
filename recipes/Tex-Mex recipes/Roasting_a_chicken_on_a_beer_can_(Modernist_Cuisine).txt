The Art and Science of Cooking, Volume 1: Volume 2 - Volume 2 - Techniques and [[Equipment]]'' ISBN 978-0982761007, I was interested to try the approach they used there.\n\nThe technique is basically to flay the [[Chicken|chicken]] (separate the skin from the flesh) , cook the chicken very slowly and then to [[Bake|bake]] quickly at an intense heat to crisp the skin.\n\nI've modified their recipe slightly by adding a rub of [[Old India Taco Seasoning]], and adding a large bunch of herbs to the empty beer can and just putting 120 ml of water into the beer can so the herbs don't burn and the chicken gets a little extra moisture.\n\nAs with most of the [[Molecular gastronomy]] recipes, they are rather involved or take longer than normal though it is generally worth the extra effort.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| 1 x 1.7 kg [3.7 lb] whole [https://www.cookipedia.co.uk/calories/chicken/bq/11#jump chicken chicken]\n| 1 tablespoon of [[Olive oil|olive oil]]\n| 2 tablespoons of [[Old India Taco Seasoning]]\n| A large bunch of [[Fresh herbs|fresh herbs]], [[Thyme|thyme]], [[Sage|sage]] and [[Rosemary|rosemary]]\n| 120 ml water\n| Empty [[Beer can|beer can]]\n| [[Grillpro Stainless Steel Chicken Roaster]] (optional)\n}}\n\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| Preheat the [[Oven|oven]] to 100\u00b0 C (225\u00b0 F - gas \u00bc) or even lower if your oven will allow\n| Remove the [[Parson's nose|parson's nose]]\n| Starting from either end, separate the skin of the [[Chicken|chicken]] from the flesh, leaving it completely intact, being careful not to tear the skin.  When you have finished, the skin should hang from the chicken like a baggy jumper.\n| I found a very large flat spoon ideal to do this.\n| Leave the skin connected to the wings and the tips of the [[Drumsticks|drumsticks]].\n| Cut a small hole in the skin at the bottom of each leg so any juices can drain. each \n| Empty the [[Beer can|beer can]] or find a volunteer to do this for you :-)\n| Pop the [[Herbs|herbs]] into the empty [[Beer can|beer can]] and add 120 ml of water.\n| If you have a [[Grillpro Stainless Steel Chicken Roaster]],  put the can on this and sit the [[Chicken|chicken]] on the roaster.  If you don't have one, put the [[Beer can|beer can]] on a [[Roasting tray|roasting tray]] and very carefully sit the chicken on the [[Beer|beer]] can.\n| Nathan Myhrvold also suggests cutting a hole in the butt, however, the way I've flayed my [[Chicken|chicken]] that is not necessary.\n| [[Bake]] the [[Chicken|chicken]] to a core temperature of 60\u00b0 C (140\u00b0 F) when measured with a [[Digital thermometer|digital thermometer]].  This will probably take around 4 hours.\n| When core temperature has been reached, remove the bird from the [[Oven|oven]] and set to one side.\n| Set the [[Oven|oven]] to its highest temperature and let it heat for 20 minutes.\n| Make a little 'hat' of [[tin-foil]] to sit over the uppermost part of the chicken to enable even [[browning]] ands return the [[Chicken|chicken]] to the [[Oven|oven]] and [[Bake|bake]] until the skin is crisp and golden.\n| This should take around 15 to 20 minutes, but watch it like a hawk or you will have a burnt, [[Smoking|smoking]] [[Chicken|chicken]].\n| Remove from the [[Oven|oven]], carve and serve immediately\n}}\n===Recipe source===\n\n* The Art and Science of Cooking, Volume 1: Volume 2 - Volume 2 - Techniques and [[Equipment]]'' ISBN 978-0982761007, Nathan Myhrvold with Chris Young and Maxime Bilet\n===Variations===\nBy adjusting the core temperature you can cook your preferred [[Meat|meat]] so it is at its best.\n\nFor juicy, tender white [[Meat|meat]] (the breast), use a core temperature of 60\u00b0 C (140\u00b0 F)\n\nFor succulent [[Brown|brown]] [[Meat|meat]] (legs and [[Thighs|thighs]]) aim for 65\u00b0 C (150\u00b0 F)\n\nMake these adjustments by leaving the door slightly ajar.\n\n===Chef's notes===\nAfter making this, I have to say that it was brilliant, really moist and juicy, however, that goes for any [[beer can chicken]], this distinct disadvantage of this method is that it is because of the variations in cooking time, it's not as easy to produce the finished dish at a very specific time.  I will still be cooking my beer can chickens the way I always done.\n{{Template:Beercan chicken -  See also}}\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:North American recipes]]\n[[Category:Tex-Mex recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:Poultry recipes]]\n[[Category:Molecular gastronomy recipes]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n[[Category:Slow cooked]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#chicken #beercan #bake #beercanchicken #roastingachickenonabeercanmodernistcuisine #equipment #modernistcuisine #rosemary #thighs #sage #herbs </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
