[[Chocolate]] atole is known as champurrado. It is typically accompanied with [[tamales]], and very popular during the Christmas holiday season (Las Posadas).\n\nThe drink typically includes [[masa]] ([[corn meal]]), water, [[piloncillo]], [[cinnamon]], [[vanilla]] and optional [[chocolate]] or [[fruit]]. The mixture is blended and heated before serving. The resulting blends vary in texture, ranging from a porridge to a very thin liquid consistency. Atole can also be prepared with [[rice flour]] or [[oatmeal]] in place of [[masa]]. In northern Mexico there is also a variation using pinole (sweetened toasted corn meal). Although atole is one of the traditional drinks of the Mexican holiday Day of the Dead, it is very common during breakfast and dinnertime at any time of year. It is usually sold as street food.\n\nOther derivations exist. In New Mexico, blue corn atole is finely ground [[cornmeal]] [[toasted]] for cooking, consumed as a grainy porridge-style drink served warm, usually sweetened with [[sugar]] and/or thinned with [[milk]]. It is usually served at breakfast like cream of wheat or oatmeal. It is said that elders would drink Atole because it gave them energy and if a mother is nursing it gives them more [[milk]]. \n\nSalvadoran varieties include atol shuco (\"dirty\" atol, a reference to its darker colour), particularly popular in the Caba\u00f1as region.\n{{CategoryLineIngredients}}\n[[Category:Ingredients]]\n[[Category:Beverages]]\n[[Category:Tex-Mex recipes]]\n[[Category:Latin American recipes]]\n[[Category:Non-alcoholic beverages]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:12032020'>#atole #masa #cornmeal #chocolate #riceflour #fruit #cornstarch #toasted #beverages #piloncillo #vanilla </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"

Cardini was opposed to using [[Anchovies|anchovies]] in his salad.\n\nIn the book From Julia Child's Kitchen, Julia Child describes how she ate a Caesar's [[Salad|salad]] at Cardini's restaurant when she was a child in 1920s, and some 50 years later she sought out and called Cardini's daughter, in order to discover the original recipe. In this recipe, [[Lettuce|lettuce]] leaves are served whole on the plate, because they are meant to be lifted by the stem and eaten with the fingers. It also calls for coddled [[Eggs|eggs]] and Italian [[Olive oil|olive oil]].\n\nRather than re create the absolute original recipe, I have chosen to go for a composite of many current 'favourite' recipes.\n\n\n'''[[Salad]]'''\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 1 small cos [[Lettuce|lettuce]], washed and separated into leaves\n| 1 50 g (2 oz) can of [[Anchovy fillets|anchovy fillets]], drained.

Gradually drizzle the [[Olive oil|olive oil]] into the [[Blender|blender]] as though you were making mayonaise.

Cardini was opposed to using [[Anchovies|anchovies]] in his salad.\n\nIn the book From Julia Child's Kitchen, Julia Child describes how she ate a Caesar's [[Salad|salad]] at Cardini's restaurant when she was a child in 1920s, and some 50 years later she sought out and called Cardini's daughter, in order to discover the original recipe. In this recipe, [[Lettuce|lettuce]] leaves are served whole on the plate, because they are meant to be lifted by the stem and eaten with the fingers. It also calls for coddled [[Eggs|eggs]] and Italian [[Olive oil|olive oil]].\n\nRather than re create the absolute original recipe, I have chosen to go for a composite of many current 'favourite' recipes.\n\n\n'''[[Salad]]'''\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 1 small cos [[Lettuce|lettuce]], washed and separated into leaves\n| 40 g (1.5 oz) [[Parmesan cheese]], freshly and finely [[Grated|grated]]\n}}\n'''Dressing'''\n{{RecipeIngredientsNB\n| 1 large [[Egg|egg]]\n| 1 clove of [[Garlic|garlic]], peeled\n| [[Juice]] of 1 [[Lime|lime]] or [[Lemon|lemon]]\n| 1 teaspoon [[English mustard powder]]\n| &frac12; teaspoon [[Worcestershire sauce]]\n| 150 ml [[Olive oil|olive oil]]\n| [[Sea Salt|sea salt]] and [[Freshly ground black pepper|freshly ground black pepper]]\n}}\n'''Cro\u00fbtons'''\n{{RecipeIngredientsNB\n| 2 slices of thick white [[Bread|bread]], crusts removed and cut into bite-sized cubes\n| 1 [[Clove garlic, crushed|clove garlic, crushed]]\n| 1 tablespoon [[Olive oil|olive oil]]\n}}\n===Method===\n'''Cro\u00fbtons'''\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Add the [[Olive oil|olive oil]] and [[croutons]] to a [[Frying pan|frying pan]], season with [[Black pepper|black pepper]], start the [[Garlic|garlic]] sizzling then add the cro\u00fbtons.

Gradually drizzle the [[Olive oil|olive oil]] into the [[Blender|blender]] as though you were making [[mayonnaise]]. As long as you don't rush adding the [[Oil|oil]], you should have a  [[Sauce|sauce]], the consistency of runny [[Salad cream]].\n}}\n'''Final assembly'''\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Leaving the leaves whole, but ripping up very big leaves, layer the [[Salad|salad]] leaves and [[Anchovies|anchovies]]\n| Drizzle with the dressing and sprinkle with [[Parmesan]], finishing with the cro\u00fbtons.\n}}\n===Variations===\n*Add a handful of [[Wild rocket leaves|wild rocket leaves]] for a spicier [[Salad|salad]].\n*Add sliced cooked chicken or turkey for a more substantial meal.\n*For a vegetarian version use a vegetarian [[Worcestershire sauce]] - the original contains anchovies.\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Accompaniments]]\n[[Category:Egg recipes]]\n[[Category:Historic recipes]]\n[[Category:Salad recipes]]\n[[Category:Starters]]\n[[Category:North American recipes]]\n[[Category:Tex-Mex recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes]]\n[[Category:Pan fried]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#salad #oliveoil #worcestershiresauce #anchovies #lettuce #garlic #egg #croutons #parmesancheese #blackpepper #wildrocketleaves </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"

It's nice - a one-pot rice dish.  Simples!</span> \n\n<span class=\"reviewAuthor\"> [[User:PSmith|Paul&nbsp;R&nbsp;Smith]] </span></span>\n}}\nJambalaya always brings to mind the Carpenters song; ''Jambalaya (On the Bayou)''  Not a Carpenters song but a dish traditionally made in one pot, with [[Meats|meats]] and [[Vegetables|vegetables]]. It is completed by adding [[Stock|stock]] and [[Rice|rice]].  Looking at various recipes in more detail, this strikes me now as a typical leftover dish.  Cooking up what you have around at the time.\n===Making this your own recipe===\nWhen I made this for the first time, not having the slightest idea what jambalaya was, it looked quite complex, however, having made it many times now I now think it is probably one of the easiest recipes around. It is also a brilliant recipe to adapt to your own personal taste.  It is also an excellent recipe for using up leftovers.\n\nJust follow a few basic steps and you will be able to make you own version of this recipe.\n* Rinse the rice in cold running water first.\n* Fry the onions, garlic and vegetables first, plus any meat that might need more cooking than the rice does.\n* Ensure the rice is well coated in the oil before adding any stock.\n* Measure the stock by doubling the volume of the rice (4 cups of water to 2 cups of rice, etc.)\n* Don't add all of the stock at once, add more if it looks as though it will dry out before the rice is done.\n* If you have ingredients that don't need much cooking (prawns etc.) or vegetables that you want to serve with a bit of a crunch then add them during the last five minutes of cooking.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 1 x 2kg (4 lb) [[Chicken|chicken]], [[Parson's nose|parson's nose removed]]\n| A few [[Bay leaf|bay leaves]]\n| 1 [[Onion|onion]], unpeeled, chopped into quarters\n| About 200 g from one or more of cooked meat\n| 40 g (1 &frac12; oz) [[Butter|butter]], [[ghee]] or [[olive oil]]\n| 4 to 7 [[Cloves garlic, peeled and crushed|cloves garlic, peeled and crushed]]\n| 6 [[Spring onions|spring onions]], [[Chopped on the diagonal|chopped on the diagonal]]\n| 2 sticks of [[Celery|celery]], 'strings' removed with a [[Mandoline|mandoline]] and chopped into moons\n| 3 or 4 sweet [[Bell peppers|bell peppers]], any colour, deseeded and chopped\n| 3 teaspoons [[Paprika powder|paprika powder]]\n| &#189; teaspoon of [[dried oregano]] or [[dried mixed herbs]]\n| 2 tablespoons fresh [[Basil leaves|basil leaves]], chopped, if available\n| 1 large can [[Plum|plum]] [[Tomatoes|tomatoes]], chopped\n| 500ml to 600 ml of the water the [[Chicken|chicken]] was [[Boiled|boiled]] in\n| 1 tablespoon [[Worcester sauce|Worcester sauce]]\n| [[Chillies]], [[chilli sauce]] or [[chilli powder]] to add warmth, not heat.\n|* I used: 1 teaspoon chili guajillo (powder), 2 teaspoons pasilla chili (diced), 1/2 a teaspoon of chipotle chillies (diced)\n|* Suggested alternative if using sauce: 1 to 2 tablespoons [[Louisiana hot pepper sauce]] (or to taste)\n| [[Sea Salt|sea salt]] and [[Freshly ground black pepper|freshly ground black pepper]]\n| 400 g (14 oz) [[Basmati rice|basmati rice]] ([[Long grain rice|long grain rice]])\n}}\n''' Garnish'''\n* Finely chopped [[Parsley|parsley]]\n\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Remove any giblets, cut off and discard the [[Parson's nose]].\n| Wash the [[Chicken|chicken]] under cold running water, inside and out\n| Place the [[Chicken|chicken]] in a large pot and pour over just enough [[Boiling|boiling]] water to cover\n| Add the [[Onion|onion]] and the [[Bay leaf|bay leaf]] and [[Boil|boil]] for about 1 hour or until tender\n| Set the [[Chicken|chicken]] to one side, reserve the [[Stock|stock]] and discard the [[Bay leaf|bay leaf]] and [[Onion|onion]] quarters\n| Once chicken has cooled discard skin and bone\n| Heat the [[Butter|butter]] in a large pan and [[Fry|fry]] the [[Garlic|garlic]] for a few minutes\n| Add the [[Ham|ham]], [[Spring onions|spring onions]], [[Celery|celery]] and [[Pepper|pepper]] and [[Saut\u00e9|saut\u00e9]] for 5 minutes\n| Rinse rice under cold running water for a few minutes until the water runs clear\n| Add the [[Rice|rice]] and [[Stir-fry|stir-fry]] for a minute so the grains are coated by the oil\n| Add the [[Stock|stock]] (about 500 ml to start), [[Tomatoes|tomatoes]], [[Spices|spices]], [[Worcester sauce|Worcester sauce]], [[Hot pepper sauce|hot pepper sauce]], [[Salt|salt]] and [[Pepper|pepper]] and [[Chicken|chicken]]\n| Stir well, cover and [[Simmer|simmer]] on a very low hob until the liquid has gone and the [[Rice|rice]] is cooked.  Add a little more water if it dries out before the rice is done.\n}}\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Chicken jambalaya in pot.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Chicken jambalaya, ready to cook\nImage:Chicken jambalaya boil.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Chicken, ready to boil\n</gallery>\n===Variations===\nI raided the garden for anything to add to the chicken boil: a few [[carrots]], some [[leeks]] a few spare sticks of [[celery]] and bunches of [[parsley]].\n===Chef's notes===\nI have doubled the rice quantity from the original recipe as there was so little rice.  I have not quite doubled the stock quantity so keep an eye on the water level to ensure that it does not dry out.\n\nRather than using [[chili sauce]] for the heat I used a mixture of my [[Exotic chili powders]] to add more than just heat.  The quantities I used did not make this hot (like a chili), just a little warmth.\n\nThe [[stock]] left from cooking the chicken is really good quality so whatever you don't use, freeze in bags or cups far later use.\n\n==See also==\n* http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jambalaya\n* http://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/1167651/chicken-and-chorizo-jambalaya\n* http://www.deliaonline.com/recipes/type-of-dish/one-pot-meals/chicken-jambalaya.html\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes|Jambalaya]]\n[[Category:Historic recipes|Jambalaya]]\n[[Category:Indian recipes|Jambalaya]]\n[[Category:Main courses|Jambalaya]]\n[[Category:Poultry recipes|Jambalaya]]\n[[Category:Rice recipes|Jambalaya]]\n[[Category:Spicy recipes|Jambalaya]]\n[[Category:Tex-Mex recipes|Jambalaya]]\n[[Category:North American recipes|Jambalaya]]\n[[Category:Favourite recipes]]\n[[Category:Boiled or simmered]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#chickenjambalaya #chicken #stock #onion #bayleaf #celery #rice #worchestersauce #ham #butter #parsley </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"

The [[tortillas]] are slightly [[fried]] and filled with [[frijoles refritos]] ([[refried beans]]) and [[pork]], or in this recipe spicy [[chorizo]].  I cheated with the refried beans as I didn't have time to soak them so I used canned, which are ok if but a little too salty.

[[Grated|grated]] [[Monterey Jack cheese]]\n| 1/3 cup fresh green or red [[Jalapeno|jalapeno]] [[Peppers|peppers]],  seeded and membraned, then [[Diced|diced]] fine\n| &frac12; cup [[Diced|diced]] [[Spanish]] (Yellow) [[Onion|onion]], fine diced\n| 3 tablespoons [[Tomato salsa|tomato salsa]] ( or more) you choose the [[Salsa|salsa]]-I make my own)\n| Chopped [[Cilantro]] (opt.)\n| &frac12; teaspoon [[Ground cumin|ground cumin]] (opt.)\n\n}}\n\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n* Have everything at or close to room temperature and a large [[Fry|fry]] pan!\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Spread all ingredients ( except [[Cheese|cheese]])with the back of a large spoon on [[Tortilla|tortilla]] one.

Place second [[Tortilla|tortilla]] over top. slide this into the pan, and [[Steam|steam]] by using pan cover, or not if you want a more brittle version of [[Quesadillas|quesadillas]]. After about 5 minutes, flip the [[Quesadilla|quesadilla]] to [[Brown|brown]] tortilla 2. When it is all sizzling (3 minutes), transfer to cutting board and slice in [[Wedges|wedges]], as you would a [[Pizza|pizza]] or [[Cheesecake|cheesecake]], 3  or 4 to a plate.\n| This recipe can be multiplied for extra appetisers. Remember: you can put in refritos, [[Steamed|steamed]] [[Corn|corn]], chopped [[Olives|olives]]...but this is the core recipe.\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe with a good light 'cervesa' ([[Beer|beer]]) and lots of paper towels\n===Variations===\nChange [[Cheeses|cheeses]]. Medium Cheddars, Canadian Brick [[Cheese]] or Colby  also work well. You can also use chopped jarred [[Jalapenos|jalapenos]] or others, but it isn't fresh anymore. Canned jalapenos are milder, usually, then their fresh ancestors.\n===Chef's notes===\nOnly the [[Tortillas|tortillas]], [[Peppers|peppers]] and [[Cheese|cheese]] are constants.\n\nI found these difficult to flip, without emptying the contents all over the hob.  If you feel doubtful, use two plates to flip the quesadillas: Lay one over the pan, flip both over, place a second plate over the first, invert those, remove the top plate, replace with the pan, invert those, remove the plate.

It consists of field [[Peas|peas]] or crowder peas ([[Black-eyed peas|black-eyed peas]]) and rice, with chopped [[Onion|onion]] and sliced [[Bacon|bacon]] or [[Sausages|sausages]], [[ham hock]] or fatback bacon.\n\nThroughout the coastal South, eating Hoppin' John on New Year's Day is thought to bring a year filled with luck, and it's eaten by everyone. The peas, or beans with little black \"eyes,\" signify coins. Fill your plate with them and your cup will run over, as in the 23rd Psalm, perhaps. [[Collard greens]] along with this dish are supposed to also add to the wealth since they are the colour of money. On the day after New Year's Day, leftover \"Hoppin' John\" is called '''\"Skippin' Jenny\"''', and further demonstrates one's frugality, bringing an even better chance of prosperity in the New Year, it is hoped.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 2 cups [[Dried|dried]] [[Black-eyed peas|black-eyed peas]] (about 340 g)\n| 2 cans of [[Black-eyed peas|black-eyed peas]], drained\n| 450 g (1 lb) lean slab [[Bacon|bacon]] \n| 1 large [[Onion|onion]], peeled and chopped\n| 1 small [[red bell pepper]], de-seeded and sliced\n| &#189; teaspoon crushed [[Chili flakes|chili flakes]]\n| &#189; teaspoon freshly ground [[cumin]] seeds\n| &#189; teaspoon dried [[oregano]]\n| &#189; teaspoon [[sea salt]] or [[celery salt]]\n| 1 [[bay leaf]]\n| 4 cups water or [[Chicken stock|chicken stock]]\n| 2 cups uncooked long-[[Grain|grain]] white [[Rice|rice]]. [[Basmati rice]] is fine for this, though probably not authentic!\n| [[Salt]] and [[Freshly ground black pepper|freshly ground black pepper]] to taste\n}}\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| If using canned black eyed [[Peas|peas]], start at step 5\n| Sort the [[Peas|peas]] and remove grit etc.\n| Soak in cold water, rinse and drain, repeat a few times\n| In a large pot, cover with cold water, bring to the [[Boil|boil]] and [[Simmer|simmer]] for 10 minutes, remove from heat and allow to stand for 2 hours.  Drain and rinse again.\n| To a large pot, add the soaked [[Black-eyed peas|black-eyed peas]], the [[ham hock]], the chopped [[Onion|onion]] and all of the herbs and spices.  If using spicy sausages I would wait for 1 hour before adding them\n| Add water or [[Chicken stock|chicken stock]] and bring to the [[Boil|boil]]\n| Reduce the heat and [[Simmer|simmer]] for 2 hours or until the [[Peas|peas]] are tender. (do not [[Boil|boil]] as the [[Beans|beans]] will burst)\n| Remove [[Bacon|bacon]], [[ham hock]] or [[Sausages|sausages]] and cut into bite-sized pieces\n| As with all [[rice]], rinse for a minute, in a sieve under cold running water to remove any excess starch\n| Return [[Meat|meat]] to pot. Stir in [[Rice|rice]], cover, and cook for 20 to 25 minutes or until rice is tender and liquid is absorbed\n| Season to taste with [[Salt|salt]] and [[Pepper|pepper]]\n}}\n===Variations===\nTry 450 g (1 lb) meaty [[Ham hocks|ham hocks]] or 450 g (1 lb) thick spicy [[Sausage|sausage]] instead of the bacon.\n===Serving suggestion===\nServe with [[collard greens]], [[cornbread]] or fresh crusty bread.\n===Chef's note===\nIf you like a bit more gravy then reduce the amount of rice.

It's really a spicy [[bean]] [[pur\u00e9e]].  It's based on a [[Mexican bean and cheese puree]] and made with leftovers from the [[freezer]].  I added the sliced tomatoes to prevent the bean [[pur\u00e9e]] from drying out.\n\nA fantastic recipe and you would never imagine it was [[vegetarian]]!\n\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 90 g [[Dried|dried]] [[haricot beans]]\n| 90 g [[Dried|dried]] [[butter beans]]\n| 2 [[Litres|litres]] of weak [[Vegetable Stock|vegetable stock]] - I make up half the advised quantity of [[Bouillon|bouillon]] powder.\n| 2 sticks of [[celery]], roughly chopped\n| 1 large [[sweet pepper]], deseeded and chopped\n| 1 bulb of [[garlic]], peeled and crushed (''or to taste'')\n| 1 [[Onion|onion]], peeled and roughly chopped\n| 3 tablespoons [[olive oil]]\n| 1 tablespoon of [[Tex-Mex seasoning]], or [[Old India Taco Seasoning]], or chopped [[chillies]], or [[chilli sauce]].\n| 110 g mature [[Cheddar cheese|cheddar cheese]], roughly [[Grated|grated]].\n| 3 large tomatoes, thinly sliced\n| 1 to 2 tablespoons of yellow cornmeal.

If it is really wet, add a tablespoon of [[yellow cornmeal]], stir well and check in another 15 minutes.  This is a very efficient way of reducing liquid, but use with caution as more than once, I've had to add more stock after doing this!\n| Add 1.5 tablespoons of olive oil.  Mix well and remove from the heat.\n| At this stage the mixture could be [[refrigerated]] or even [[frozen]] and the final cooking stage done at a later time.\n| Once the [[Oven|oven]] is hot, coat a [[shallow oven proof dish]] with 1.5 tablespoons of olive oil and spread the bean mixture evenly over the surface.\n| Sprinkle with grated [[cheese]] and top with the thinly sliced tomatoes.\n| [[Bake|bake]] the [[Puree|puree]] for about 45 minutes to 1 hour.\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe with [[soured cream]] and plain [[tortilla chips]] or broken up [[taco shells]] to use as edible spoons!\n\nThis dish is equally good hot or cold.  Store any unused [[pur\u00e9e]] in a [[Lock and Lock]] style box to prevent it drying out.\n===Chef's notes===\nI used [[dried black lentils]] for the beans and for health reasons, [[olive oil]] for the vegetable oil as this recipe uses rather a lot. For the cheese I used a mixture of mature [[gouda]] and mature [[cheddar]].\n\n===Variations===\nThis is a great recipe for experimentation.  Almost any vegetables can be added to this recipe.

I spotted the [[Gressingham Memphis Barbecue Pulled Duck]] in Morrisons and thought it would make a good [[Taco|taco]] filling. \n\nThe [[Duck|duck]] was very good and I'll be getting more today.  Do note though that the duck is notreally pulled duck, it's duck legs with a sauce that need to be ''pulled'' once they've been cooked.  \n\nThe Old El Paso [[Tacos|tacos]] however, ''really'' let this recipe down.  They are so thin now that they break apart as you touch them. Any because they are so miserably thin, they don't even have the crunch purported on the packet.  Another cynical attempt at increasing profits I guess.\n\nIf you don't want to use the flimsy El Paso [[Tacos]], try to hunt down the cheaper and far nice Discovery [[Taco trays|taco trays]], or forget tacos altogether and use [[Corn|corn]] or [[Flour tortillas|flour tortillas]] instead.\n\nThe [[Duck|duck]] feels like it might serve 4 but is actually contains 2 duck legs, a [[Foil|foil]] tray and a sachet of [[Sauce|sauce]], plenty for 2 people, not enough for four.\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| 1 pack [[Gressingham Memphis BBQ Pulled Duck]] (2 duck legs in with [[Barbecue sauce|barbecue sauce]])\n| 1 Pack Discovery [[Taco trays|taco trays]] or if you must ,1 Pack El Paso [[Taco shells]] (see notes above)\n| 6 [[Spring onions|spring onions]]\n| 12 [[Baby tomatoes|baby tomatoes]]\n| Half a green [[Sweet Pepper|sweet pepper]]\n| 10 [[Black cherries|black cherries]]\n| 150 ml pot of [[Sour cream|sour cream]]\n}}\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n\n* Preheat your [[Oven|oven]] to 180\u00b0 C (350\u00b0 F - gas 4), [fan oven 160\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour]\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Memphis BBQ pulled duck tacos ingredients.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The basic ingredients\nImage:Gressingham Memphis Barbecue Pulled Duck.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Gressingham Memphis Barbecue Pulled Duck]] (whole duck legs with sauce)\n</gallery>\n\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| Remove the [[Duck|duck]] legs from the plastic wrapping and place in the tray provided, make sure you include all the lovely [[Fat|fat]] too!\n| Leave the [[Sauce|sauce]] sachet to one side for now\n| [[Roast]] the [[Duck|duck]] legs at 180\u00b0 C for 25 minutes, uncovered, in the tray provided\n| After 25 minutes, drain and discard some of the cooking juices (see [[Chef's notes]] below).\n| Add the contents of the Memphis [[Barbecue sauce|barbecue sauce]] to the duck's legs and mix well\n| [[Bake]] for a further 10 minutes\n| When there is 5 minutes remaining pop the [[Taco trays|taco trays]] or fragile El Paso [[Taco shells|taco shells]] into the [[Oven|oven]] to warm up\n| Meanwhile: chop the [[Spring onions|spring onions]] ([[Scallions|scallions]])\n| Halve the [[Tomatoes|tomatoes]]\n| Halve the [[Cherries|cherries]] and remove the stones\n| Chop the [[Green pepper|green pepper]]\n| Using two forks, shred the [[Duck|duck]] legs with two forks\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe the pulled [[Duck|duck]], [[Vegetables|vegetables]] and [[Tacos|tacos]] and [[Sour cream|sour cream]] in separate dishes so diners can assemble the tacos at the table\n===Variations===\nUse whatever filling ingredients that take your fancy, some other suggestions, sliced red onions, avocado, pickled chillies, crispy lettuce, pineapple chunks.\n===Chef's notes===\nThe [[Gressingham BBQ Pulled Duck]] (legs) are already pre-cooked. If you are using [[Fresh duck|fresh duck]] legs, they will will probably take about the same time, but the [[Oven|oven]] could do with being 1 little warmed (190\u00b0 C - 200\u00b0 C) and they will benefit from resting for 15 minutes once removed from the oven.\n\nThe cooking instructions on the [[Gressingham Pulled Duck]] suggests discarding all of the cooking juices after 25 minutes of [[Roasting|roasting]]. I would definitely suggest otherwise.  Next time I will mix them in with the [[Barbecue sauce|barbecue sauce]], and not waste them.\n\nI allowed the juices to solidify overnight and it was almost all lovely tasty jelly, hardly any [[Fat|fat]] - made a great [[Sandwich|sandwich]] filling and reminded me of jelly and [[Dripping|dripping]] of old.\n{{Tortillas-See also}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:British recipes]]\n[[Category:North American recipes]]\n[[Category:Tex-Mex recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Spicy recipes]]\n[[Category:Fruit recipes]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n[[Category:Barbecue recipes]]\n[[Category:Poultry recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#duck #memphisbbqpulledducktacos #barbecuesauce #tacotrays #tacos #tacoshells #springonions #sourcream #sauce #fat #cherries </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"

Skim any scum that appears on the surface.\n| Drain the beans and return to the pan. Pour 1.5 tablespoons of [[Oil|oil]] over the beans, add the onion pieces and the stock. Bring to the boil, cover and reduce to a simmer.\n| [[Simmer]] for about 30 minutes or until they are softening and the skins beginning to [[Split|split]].\n| Add the 100 ml of olive oil to a [[Casserole dish|casserole dish]] and place in the oven whilst it is preheating.\n| Add the [[Salt|salt]] and continue to [[Simmer|simmer]] for another 35 minutes until the [[Beans|beans]] become a mush.  this time will very depending upon the type of bean.\n| If they dry out during this stage add a little more [[Stock|stock]].\n| Remove the [[Beans|beans]] from the heat, drain them and using a [[Food processor|food processor]], blend them to a pur\u00e9e with the [[Milk|milk]] and [[chillies]].\n| Taste for seasoning and add [[Tabasco sauce]] to taste if using.\n| Once the [[Oven|oven]] is hot, carefully stir the [[Bean|bean]] pur\u00e9e into the hot [[Oil|oil]] and mix very well.  Don't be concerned about the obvious amount of excess oil, this will absorb into the bean mixture during the last 15 minutes of cooking. \n| Return the [[Casserole|casserole]] of [[Beans|beans]] to the [[Oven|oven]] and [[Bake|bake]] the [[Puree|puree]] for about 45 minutes to 1 hour.\n| By now the [[Beans|beans]] should be [[Drying|drying]] out at the edges, don't add any more [[Stock|stock]] at this stage.\n| Sprinkle the [[Beans|beans]] with the [[Grated|grated]] [[Cheese|cheese]] and return to the [[Oven|oven]] for 15 minutes or until melted.\n| Serve directly.\n}}\n===Variations===\nI like to fiddle with my recipes and encouraged by the recent success [[Dal makhani]], I also added 3 fat crushed cloves of [[Garlic|garlic]] and 200 ml of chopped tomatoes at the blending stage.\n\n[[Dried|dried]] [[Kidney beans|kidney beans]], [[chick peas]] or any similar dried [[Bean|bean]] work fine in this recipe.\n\nI think that [[yogurt]] would work just as well as [[milk]] too.\n===Serving suggestions===\nServe with [[soured cream]] and plain [[tortilla chips]] to use as edible spoons!\n===Chef's notes===\nI used [[dried black lentils]] for the beans and for health reasons, [[olive oil]] for the vegetable oil as this recipe uses rather a lot.

We have tried many brands over the years and exclusively use La Coste\u00f1a for their unbeatable flavour.\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| 2 [[Hass avocados]] (medium size)\n| &#8531; [[Cup|cup]] fresh [[Tomato|tomato]], chopped (about 1 medium)\n| &#8531; [[Cup|cup]] white [[Onion|onion]], finely chopped \n| 1 medium [[Clove|clove]] [[Garlic|garlic]], very finely chopped-ideally use a [[Garlic press|garlic press]]\n| &#8531; [[Cup|cup]] [[Coriander|coriander]], finely chopped (cut off steams just below 2nd leaves)\n| &#189; [[Lime|lime]], juiced\n| &#189; teaspoon [[Salt|salt]]\n| 3 teaspoons La Coste\u00f1a Serrano escabeche (the [[Marinate|marinate]] liquid from the tin) \n| 2 [[Serrano chillies|serrano chillies]] finely chopped\n| Pinch [[Ground black pepper|ground black pepper]]\n}}\n\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| Add all of the ingredients to a bowl\n| Using a fork, mix for a minutes to ensure everything is evenly distributed\n| Serve immediately\n}}\n===Chef's notes===\nDo not use any other [[Avocados|avocados]] than Haas as they do not have the correct texture or flavour to make [[Guacamole|guacamole]], Haas are generally very dark in colour and have rough skin.\n\nOnly use perfectly ripe [[Avocados|avocados]], if the flesh is too firm or grey, it doesn't belong in [[Guacamole|guacamole]]. Grey avocados belong in the compost heap.\n\n[[Limes]] may yield variable amounts of [[Juice|juice]], so follow your taste buds.

The Art and Science of Cooking, Volume 1: Volume 2 - Volume 2 - Techniques and [[Equipment]]'' ISBN 978-0982761007, I was interested to try the approach they used there.\n\nThe technique is basically to flay the [[Chicken|chicken]] (separate the skin from the flesh) , cook the chicken very slowly and then to [[Bake|bake]] quickly at an intense heat to crisp the skin.\n\nI've modified their recipe slightly by adding a rub of [[Old India Taco Seasoning]], and adding a large bunch of herbs to the empty beer can and just putting 120 ml of water into the beer can so the herbs don't burn and the chicken gets a little extra moisture.\n\nAs with most of the [[Molecular gastronomy]] recipes, they are rather involved or take longer than normal though it is generally worth the extra effort.\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n\n| 1 x 1.7 kg [3.7 lb] whole [https://www.cookipedia.co.uk/calories/chicken/bq/11#jump chicken chicken]\n| 1 tablespoon of [[Olive oil|olive oil]]\n| 2 tablespoons of [[Old India Taco Seasoning]]\n| A large bunch of [[Fresh herbs|fresh herbs]], [[Thyme|thyme]], [[Sage|sage]] and [[Rosemary|rosemary]]\n| 120 ml water\n| Empty [[Beer can|beer can]]\n| [[Grillpro Stainless Steel Chicken Roaster]] (optional)\n}}\n\n===Method===\n{{RecipeMethod\n\n| Preheat the [[Oven|oven]] to 100\u00b0 C (225\u00b0 F - gas \u00bc) or even lower if your oven will allow\n| Remove the [[Parson's nose|parson's nose]]\n| Starting from either end, separate the skin of the [[Chicken|chicken]] from the flesh, leaving it completely intact, being careful not to tear the skin.

The basic idea is to carefully balance the chicken on a 3/4 full can of beer using its legs as an additional support, coat it with a flavoured rub and [[roast]] it.  The [[Steam|steam]] from the beer permeates the chicken to produce a succulent dish.  I think my [[Taco mix|taco mix]] suits this admirably, though any flavoured rub would do.\n\nOur American friends seem to barbecue chicken using this method, and though I'm sure it's worth trying, I can't believe that the upper part of the chicken would even get warm on our barbecue.  And we have a BIG barbecue.  I would welcome any feedback.\n\nThe process is made even easier and safer with one of these: [[Grillpro Stainless Steel Chicken Roaster]].\n\n{{RecipeIngredients\n| 1.5kg free range [[Chicken|chicken]]\n| 6 tablespoons [[Taco mix|taco mix]], El Paso taco mix or a seasoning rub of your choice\n| 2 tablespoons [[Olive oil|olive oil]]\n| 440ml can of [[Beer|beer]] or [[Lager|lager]] \n| 1 [[tangerine]] or [[orange]] (optional)\n\n}}\n\n===[[Mise en place]]===\n* Preheat the oven to 200\u00b0 C (400\u00b0 F - Gas 6)\n===Method===\n\n{{RecipeMethod\n| Wash the outside of the beer can\n| [[Parson's nose|Remove the parson's nose]], any giblets, bags, tranklements etc. from the [[Chicken|chicken]] \n| Cut off and discard the [[Parson's nose]].\n| Rinse inside and out under cold running water and pat dry with kitchen towel\n| Rub 1 tablespoon of the [[Taco mix|taco mix]] into the cavity of the bird \n| Rub the outside of the [[Chicken|chicken]] with the [[Olive oil|olive oil]] and coat with 3 tablespoons of [[Taco mix|taco mix]]\n| Seal the neck of the bird by folding over and skewering with [[skewers]] or [[cocktail sticks]] \n| Open the [[Beer|beer]] and toast the start of the proceedings with about a &#188; of the beer - you don't want a full can\n| Punch a few holes around the empty top-part of the can\n| Add the remaining rub to the [[Beer|beer]] tin\n| Sit the [[Chicken|chicken]] on the [[Beer|beer]] can in a baking tray and balance it on its legs. A small chicken sits quite happily; a large chicken might be a bit trickier\n| Cut the top off the tangerine so the juice can run down while it cooks, affix with a [[cocktail stick]] into the top cavity (see photo) and add the cut slice as a hat!\n| Place the baking tray in the bottom of the oven\n| After 30 minutes, reduce the heat to 180\u00b0 C ( 350\u00b0 F - Gas 4)\n| The [[Chicken|chicken]] should be cooked in about 1.5 hours [total cooking timw], depending upon the size of the bird. Check every 15 minutes towards the end.  It is done when the juices run clear if the deepest part of the flesh (eg the thigh) is pierced with a metal skewer or sharp knife\n| Remove the [[Chicken|chicken]] extremely carefully with [[Oven gloves|oven gloves]] and tongs if needed.\n| Allow to rest for 10 minutes before carving\n}}\n<gallery widths=300px heights=300px perrow=5>\nImage:Tex-Mex beercan chicken ready.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Oven-ready!\nImage:Tex-Mex beercan chicken ingredients.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The basic ingredients\n</gallery>\n===Serving suggestions===\nUsing [[The Jamie Oliver carving method|the Jamie Oliver carving method]], serve with [[roast potatoes]] and [[garlic mayonnaise]].\n\nThe remaining beer could be used to make gravy if needed.\n===Variations===\nTry this with a cock [[pheasant]] (hens are too small) and use [[cider]] or [[wine]] instead of [[beer]].  Wash out an empty 440 ml [[beer]] can and pour 330 ml of dry white [[wine]] or dry [[cider]] into it.  For this, a [[herb]] and [[Garlic|garlic]] rub is excellent - this can be made with the ingredients (minus the [[onion]] and [[pork]]) used in the [[Slow roast herby pork belly]] recipe.\n\nWe have also tried this with a small [[duck]], but the cavity was too large for the [[beer]] can, but not big enough for two cans.  Duckling might be worth a try if you can get it.\n===Chicken falls over?===\nMy chicken has just fallen over, I may have to get one of these: [http://www.socal.co.uk/BBQ_Accessories/Beer_Can_Chicken/Grillpro_Stainless_Steel_Chicken_Roaster/332/17302 (beer can) Chicken roaster]\n\nLarge chickens seem to be ok - it's the smaller birds that have problems balancing on a beer can.  440ml is probably the biggest can you should use with all but the largest birds. The last few times I have made this, I have placed the chicken and can inside an oven proof saucepan, in the oven, so the chicken has a little more support if it tends to lean over.  It also makes far less mess if it does fall over!\n\n... or go for the real thing: '''[[Grillpro Stainless Steel Chicken Roaster]]'''!\n{{Template:Beercan chicken - See also}}\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes|Chicken]]\n[[Category:Chilli pepper recipes|Chicken]]\n[[Category:Cooking with beer|Chicken]]\n[[Category:Main courses|Chicken]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes|Chicken]]\n[[Category:Poultry recipes|Chicken]]\n[[Category:Spicy recipes|Chicken]]\n[[Category:North American recipes]]\n[[Category:Tex-Mex recipes|Chicken]]\n[[Category:Cooking with wine]]\n[[Category:Favourite recipes]]\n[[Category:Student recipes]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#beer #chicken #texmexbeercanchicken #tacomix #oliveoil #wine #cider #cocktailstick #roastpotatoes #steam #orange </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
