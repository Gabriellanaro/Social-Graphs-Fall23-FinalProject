Serve with [[Plain boiled rice|plain boiled rice]].\n===Variations===\n'''Turn it fruity:''' I chopped up a few [[pineapple]] rings, left over from making [[Chicken satay]] and added at the start of the cooking stage and also a little pineapple juice together with a handful of raisins.  Finally I added a chopped up [[banana]] but only at the very end of the cooking process, just long enough for them to warm up.  This is probably not authentic, but it's nice to have a sweet curry now and then! \n{{Template:PeelingGinger}}\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Chinese recipes]]\n[[Category:Thai recipes]]\n[[Category:Historic recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Spicy recipes]]\n[[Category:Beef recipes]]\n[[Category:Meat recipes]]\n[[Category:Potato recipes]]\n[[Category:Slow cooker recipes]]\n[[Category:Pan fried]]\n[[Category:Slow cooked]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#wok #coconutmilk #grated #thai #vegetablestock #beefstock #nampla #slowcooker #newpotatoes #coriander #juice </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
