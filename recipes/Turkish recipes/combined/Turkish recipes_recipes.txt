I would be inclined to allow them to completely defrost before cooking, especially if you were to fry them.\n===Chef's notes===\nI did make these with whole spices, but the effect was rather bland so have amended to finely ground spices which should 'spread' the flavour further.\n\nThe falafel pictured were oven baked.  Next time I would flatten them and shallow fry them so the outsides caramelise.  This did not happen with oven baking.\n\nOven directions: Heat [[Oven|oven]] to 200\u00b0 C (400\u00b0 F - gas 6), [fan oven 180\u00b0 C & reduce cooking time by 10 mins per hour], spread out on a baking tray and spray or brush with [[olive oil]] before baking for 3 minutes.\n{{SeeAlso-HalloumiRecipes}}\n* [[Beetroot recipes|Our favourite beetroot recipes]]\n{{RecipeLine}}\n[[Category:Recipes]]\n[[Category:Greek recipes]]\n[[Category:Middle Eastern recipes]]\n[[Category:North African recipes]]\n[[Category:Tunisian recipes]]\n[[Category:Turkish recipes]]\n[[Category:Main courses]]\n[[Category:Snacks and light bites]]\n[[Category:Tapas, mezze and antipasti]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian recipes]]\n[[Category:Cheese recipes]]\n[[Category:Grain and bean recipes]]\n[[Category:Salad recipes]]\n[[Category:Vegetable recipes]]\n[[Category:Baked or roasted]]\n[[Category:Grilled, griddled or barbecued]]\n[[Category:Pan fried]]\n[[Category:Favourite recipes]]\n[[Category:Unusual recipes]]\n\n<!-- footer hashtags --><code 'hashtagrev:032020'>#beetrootfalafelwithtoastedhalloumicheese #tahini #oliveoil #yogurt #coffeegrinder #mortarandpestle #toasted #beetroot #falafel #breadcrumbs #dip </code><!-- /footer_hashtags -->"
