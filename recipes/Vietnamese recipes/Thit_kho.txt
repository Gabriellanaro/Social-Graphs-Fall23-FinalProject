Apply medium low heat and wait until it turns [[Brown|brown]], thick and bubbly.\n| Add the chunks of [[Pork belly|pork belly]], a tablespoon each of [[Fish sauce|fish sauce]] and [[Soy sauce|soy sauce]], and a tablespoon of [[Black pepper|black pepper]]. At this point also add some water or [[Coconut|coconut]] water if available. Add just enough liquid to reach the top of the [[Pork|pork]] chunks.\n| [[Simmer]] until almost fully cooked and add the [[Boiled eggs|boiled eggs]]. Make sure to stir them so they turn [[Brown|brown]] all over and soak up the [[Sauce|sauce]].\n| When the [[Pork|pork]] is cooked and shrunk it's ready!\n}}\n===Serving suggestions===\nBest served with freshly cooked [[Rice|rice]].\n===Variations===\nI'm sure there are many variations of this recipe.
